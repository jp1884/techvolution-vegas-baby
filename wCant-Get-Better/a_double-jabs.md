## Double Jabs

- It's been 2 days since I processed an insurance claim. It's a good day.

- Ever since I stopped processing insurance claims, everyday of my life has been better than the day before it. That means everytime you see me, that's the best day of my life.

- Evolution has passed our Industrial Age way of life by. We are dinosaurs in an Ice Age. Those in charge (understandably) listen to their biology, telling them to abandon fairness and ensure they get the best life-raft.

- You shouldn't be listening to your elective representative's platform. You should be telling them your real-life problems.

- Voting according to platforms is like taking drugs based on marketing. Understanding your technological problems is like knowing your medical problems. Find an expert and solve it and move on. (note 198 characters)

- Getting your political advice from someone who talks for a living, is like getting your medical advice from doctors who only give paid talks at conferences.

- Once you start working with someone to solve your mutual real-life problem, politics talks gets easier because you're talking specifics.

- Once you start working with side-by-side with someone to solve your mutual real-life problem, politics talks gets easier because you both have a definite end goal.

- F*ck. People should be working in the metaverse and living in reality.

- If I had one wish, it would be tech superstars worked at Dunder Mifflin and could only leave once they've made office work as efficient as searching new shoes.

- Unemployment should be 60%+.

- If a physicists can't abandon string theory and start their careers over, how can they expect coal miners to accept climate change?

- Cow hoof cleaning. Basket making. Cooking prep. If no one watches your job on YouTube, your job is very likely fucking useless. It's because your not solving a problem.

- I wonder how television stars feel that given today's viewership, people would have rather have been watching people remove barnicles from sea turtles instead of watching their shows.

- people with useless jobs need a story to explain themselves. this explains the bitterness and irrationality of modern politics more than anything else.

- efficiency should be the guiding light. it's not. this explains modern politics.

- if you don't know who the sucker is, than it's you. if you're only once who speaks with a customer, you're the customer of too many management levels.

- we need to keep making so much content because space travel will be that fucking boring. otherwise there's no reason us subsizing all these video productions.

- you can't make a dent in climate change, so why do you make a difference in the economy or voting?

- Baby boomers advocating a return to office should be forced to pickup their retirement checks in person every single day of their lives. No kidding. No Netflix either. It's DVD's for you. Again no kidding.

- Boomers, we're coming after your pensions.

- Science is merely the absence of delusion.

- If a teacher isn't on the cutting edge of learning, then what are they teaching?

- We're like ants in a death spiral. Industrial Age people with nowhere to go but round and round until it all ends. <https://www.instagram.com/p/CtRTVs7Atnk/>

- Dinosaurs didn't go off into the sunset. Neither will boomers, or the rest of us.

- Superficial jobs create superficial politics.

- All baby-boomer pension cheques should be printed and mailed. Let them commute to pick'em up, cash them, and spend their money. It's more efficient for society after all.

- Being political doesn't mean embracing a single ideology. It means using any tool or technique to make your life more efficient.

- Our economy is being run by people looking at their dog themed calendars thinking "I've got 4 more years"

- We're stagnant on the tech tree of life, which is why bozos get their time in the sun. See. moderate  instagram congressman.
