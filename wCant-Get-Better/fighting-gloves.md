# Why Things Can't Get Better
## Fighting Gloves

A few years ago, the mixed-martial artist Connor McGregor was about to fight the legendary boxer Floyd Mayweather. After a series of magical MMA knockouts, fans wanted to know if McGregor could defeat Mayweather in a boxing match. It was an intriguing question with a worldwide promotional tour and massive viewership. Not everyone was happy though. Some boxing fans sneered at McGregor's chances, to which his promoter Dana White said, "Give my fighter respect. Remember if Conor one more tool, he'd blow Floyd away".

What White meant was one more fighting technique. While boxing has great punching, it only allows punching, so it's not surprising Mayweather was the better boxer and won. Because MMA allows any technique McGregor had spent his career training everything from kicks to submissions. His boxing is good but not elite.

MMA is a combat sport that's not really a sport; it's the absence of sport. Sports like boxing have huge rulebooks; MMA doesn't. It mimics evolution, where the only rule is victory. The animal kingdom is very diverse because each lifeform is free to find it's own way to survive; "survival of the fittest" doesn't have an asteriks "as long as it's within the rules". Likewise, MMA lets creativity reign supreme. That's why "admit defeat and learn" is its motto. The best MMA fighter is the one who can win using any technique.

Well almost. There are some rules in MMA. No groin strikes, biting, or eye pokes. Gouching someone's eyes is hardly a dependable self-defense technique. When Dana White said McGregor only needed one more tool to ensure victory, he didn't mean a finger in Mayweather's eye. 

It makes sense for MMA to rule out eye pokes. Nobody wants to see them. But watch MMA, and you'll often see eye pokes a plenty.

There's a reason why. Because MMA gloves need to facilitate wrestling and grappling, they expose the fingers. During wild punching exchanges, it's easy for fingers to end up in the eye of the opponent.

Surely, a sport like MMA, designed to evole of ever more perfect fighting techniques, should strive to eliminate eye pokes.

Most assuredly, Dana White, the champion of MMA, would do anything to rid MMA of eye pokes.

The answer to these questions is the answer to why the rising cost of living, your job satisfaction, climate change, and so many other things can not get better.

Your job, your kid's future, the cost of housing, rising government debt, the increase in wars, inflation, and almost everything else getting us worried today can not get better. Not anytime soon. This blog explains why. And the story of eye pokes in MMA is a small example.

Dana White runs MMA's largest promotion, the Ultimate Fighting Championships. In the UFC, fighters get paid double if they win. Fighters that win specularly get a bonus and get noticed by fans. Fighters have good reason to win fights.

And therefore a good reason to avoid eye pokes.

That's why a former boxer and current MMA coach Trevor Wittman stepped up. With his years of experience he invented gloves that drastically reduced eye pokes. You see, the default position of typical MMA gloves is an open hand, making it easy to put fingers into eyes. Trevor's new gloves' curl the hand closed like a fist. MMA fighters must consciously open their hands to extend their fingers, which makes no sense when punching. The new gloves also have better padding, lowering the chances that fighters break their hand.

Fighters, coaches, and even UFC commentator and Dana White's friend Joe Rogan say Trevor's gloves are a huge improvement; Rogan said of them, "I like how it's curved... I like them a lot. These are definitely better than the ones the UFC is using right now, I'll tell you that."

Victory!

Nope. It's been several years since these new gloves were available, and still, UFC fans are paying for fights filled with eye pokes. 

Here's an small example of why things can't get better in the our economy.

Despite having the tools to improve a systemic problem, we aren't. As a result we aren't following the rules of evolution. So eye pokes, and millions of more troubles are left alone to rot our economy.

Like any animal in nature, we're thus doomed to suffer.

You may be asking why can't we overcome and use new technology to solve problems?

Let me answer your question by asking who should decide what gloves an MMA fighter uses. Should it be the fighter wearing the gloves? Should it be the fighter getting punched by them? Should it be the doctor stiching up eyeballs. Should it be the fans paying for them all?

Who decides what products you wear, buy, and use? It's not a silly question. Lots of societies restrict what a person can control. 

America is unique. Within safety considerations, we know anyone should be free to buy whatever product they want. Anyone should also be free to elect any government representative they want. Anyone should especially be free to make friends and marry whomever they want.

But when it comes to using tools at work, we're a society that tolerates a person telling another what product to use.

Eye poke problems are the result. While boxers choose their own gloves, the UFC forces its fighters to use the inferior glove. Anyone with a job in America today can sympathize their frustrations with company-provided tools being significantly worse than what we buy ourselves in the free market.

Most American workers have absolutely no say in their tools, setup, clothing, hours, or much of anything.

Most people hate their jobs because of it. The tools we're given from modern day enterprises and companies are a morgue of old, aging, and ineffective tools that customers would never buy. But these enterprise tools are protected from competition and so unnaturally live on in workers unhappy hands. 

We've freed individuals at home, but we have a blindspot. Our society still protects middlemen at work who force their inferior products onto our society. That's anti-evolution. The one rule mother nature demands every lifeform on Earth follows--survival of the fittest--isn't followed, and thus we suffer our current economic angst, uncertainity, and troubles.

---

Now you might be thinking of economics, politics, and a million supposed good reasons why managers, CEOs, Michael Scott, or whomever has the right to tell workers (and indirectly customers) what products to depend on.

Humanity's heard these reasons before. Owners of aging technology have a host of good stories to justify restricting competition. British aristocrats talked about their noble blood. Husbands talked about the frailty of women. Today our evolutionary antagonists justify themselves with employee contracts and corporate revenue targets. Too often, the public listens to and debates these stories instead of embracing and fighting for technological evolution by asking simple questions.

Such as, why is the better product not being used in America? If you're forcing the inferior product to be used, why aren't you liable for its consequences? And the best question of all is, why can't you win a fair technological fight?

These simple questions would get most people fired from their job. White certainly doesn't care to answer them. I'm not ragging on the promoter either. He's a victim of our collective ignorance. He's being distracted from putting on the best fights possible because humanity doesn't yet realize constant technological evolution is our only salvation. We're so ignorant today that we let a fighter be told to use a glove that breaks his hand and pokes someone's eye out.

How can any words, no matter how well reasoned or believed in, justify a terrible result like eye pokes? What glove would you want to wear? Would you tolerate such inferior products in the military? What about in the car you drive or the medicine you use?

Is any animal in nature forced to use a bad adaption? What chances would a lifeform have if it let itself get poked in the eye because of words?

You might be thinking could workers run amok making choices they're unfit to make?

Of course not. Power plants, factories, mainframes are large pieces of technology an individual worker can't decide on. But the phone you use, the software you use, uniforms, fighting gloves aren't critical things. And the free market has a host of standards associations to be sure products are high quality and compatible. The Canadian Standards Association, International Organization for Standardization, The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Consumer Reports. A free-market doesn't mean low quality. Quite the opposite, it exposes bad quality and encourages evolution.

There's no technical reason why most workers shouldn't choose their own tools. Or at the very least have a input in their tools, the right to contest decisions, and the knowledge that customers will know who is responsible when the tools perform badly. As of today, the worker using a tool has no say, input, or recourse but gets most of the blame because they're the only face customers see.

The result is no surprise. Our problems are piling up because our tools are not keeping up. How can workers become productive to earn higher paychecks if they're forced to use products evolution wants dead.

Humanity has often ignored technological improvements. It never ends well. When an army fights a war with old equipment it often loses. When a consumer shops in a command economy, innovation suffers greatly. Thwarting innovation is so damaging because we're not biological beings. Biological improvements take millions of years to evolve. We don't improve ourselves biologically, we improve ourselves technologically. But if the person suffering the pain of buggy software, confusing manuals, bad quality gloves, has no say, evolution is delayed or just doesn't happen.

The worst part is, we simply don't think innovating ever more efficient ways to live, i.e. technological evolution, is our salvation.

We thus instead gravitate toward stories about "noble blood," personal beliefs, political ideology, or government policy. These stories are easy to engage with. But they have so little importance compared to practical solutions.

If you're thinking of the policies of Left or Right are the true saviour (or cause) of our current problems consider this...

Eye pokes are already against the rules, and no one does them on purpose, so regulation isn't the answer. Eye pokes also hurt customer satisfaction but still the business let's them go on, so relying on business competition isn't working either. The truth is eyepokes happen because of bad gloves, and they need a better glove to be solved.

Neither Left or Right, or anyone else, says the person getting poked in the eye should be free to decide what gloves he's getting punched with. Like workers around America using terrible tools, the person choosing a tool isn't suffering the pain of its use.

And, once you accept we're not biological beings, but technological ones, you'll notice the things we politically fight about, our expensive education system, rising cost of transportation, confusing tax code, rising inflation, unaccountable charities, chaotic medical system are like eyepokes; they're all caused by bad technology.

This isn't a blog about following someone's rules or believing in political mysticism. We need better tools. We need the freedom to develop and use them because we live in nature, and nature demands quick adaptions.

Just ask Conor McGregor. In a real fight he would easily defeat Floyd Mayweather. But he was restricted and thus lost. Our economy has the same restrictions. From paper supply to medical insurance, education to home construction, our economy suffers from a million eye pokes. Superior products live on at home and in the military, but our technological ecosystem isn't complete. It's held back by inferior products that live on in our workplaces.

And we don't fight back even when getting poked in the eye. Because we don't think using better technology is our true job.

This blog explains why things can't get better until we do.



## Cuts

Funny enough, I think this new name "Can't Get Better" probably came from Niles Crane's opening line while temping the radio "Let's Get Better". What a good actor, cast, writers, and show what was. Visions of Nat King Cole.

Dana wouldn't tolerate a government restrciting MMA fights or telling hte publiv what to watch. He defended the McGregor fight from boxers/Oscar who said not to buy it because it was an affront to boxing. "Dana White gives the fans the fights they want to see." "Fans just want to see great fights."
Eye pokes are against the rules, and no one does them on purpose, but they happen. It's a technological failing that needs a technological solution.

MMA has a virute of "tap and learn". Since the sport is so diverse, athletes must embrace change. It's not only these gloves and eye pokes. Its the time lost in resisting improvements. We can't have a fight everytime someone with a worst product doesn't want to embrace defeat.

In humanity's turbulent history, many people who led those societies sold their superiority over others. Although aristocratic masters talked about the inequality of their lessers, what they actually did day to day was restrict their access to better tools.

- This is an article. Would I business survive if it told it's customers "take it or leave it" when being given a bad tool. Where would Amazon, Netflix, Facebook be if we told them "online shopping, streaming, friendships are okay, but you're still going to need to maintain physical stores, DVD rental shops, and arcades  because real-work only happens with oversight, approvals, face to face meetings. Oh and by the way we can't cut prices because this costs so much.

Would you invest in these companies? Would you use their produts? Yet this is the burden being put onto workers today forced to return to the office pay for expensive commutes while being told there's not the money to provide raises or buy new tools but the money exists to pay for endless cubicles and meeting rooms.

- Nobles don't innovate solutions, they manipulate their lessers to accept the problem.
