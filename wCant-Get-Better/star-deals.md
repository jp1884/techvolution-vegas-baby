# Why Things Can’t Get Better
## #6 - You're Savings Account Can't Get Better

For many people times are tough, money is getting short, and they could use some help paying the bills. Regular folk could always use more money, but today is more different than any time since the 1970s. Paychecks have never kept up with the rising cost of living, but ordinary people could use their credit card, line of credit, or home equity to make up the difference when needed.

This blog is an ongoing series why things can’t get better. In this article I explain one reason why your savings account won’t get larger and why paying the bills will only get harder for the foreseable future.

To realize this for yourself you must realize the difference between investments and purchases and that as consumers we've been buying, loving, and giving away our loyalty to a lot of stuff that gives no returns. I'll show you what I mean by talking about _Star Wars_.

_Star Wars_ was released in 1977. It was a huge success that spawned sequels, prequels, tv shows, comics, action figures, computer games, and more. The movie about a small rebellion fighting an evil empire was so successful grandparents and grandchildren today revel in the same story.

But _Star Wars_ didn't start as a success.

The movie was the brainchild of George Lucas. The young filmmaker's second movie, _American Graffiti_ (1974), was about to be released. It told the story of 1950's youth in a single night of drag racing, first dates, and juvenile fun. As it was being edited, the movie was gaining attention in Hollywood.

Lucas wanted to spread his creative wings. Inspired by the space comics he loved as a child, he wrote a space opera called _Star Wars_. With feedback from his filmmaker friends and collaborators, he wanted to bring a story about a galaxy far far away to Americans. He went to Hollywood to get it made.

And no one was buying it.

Many great ideas are rejected. So, it's not surprising _Star Wars_ had a rough start. Thankfully the studio chief at 20th Century Fox, Alan Ladd, saw an early cut of American Graffiti and saw potential in Lucas and his weird movie. _Star Wars_ got funded; barely, the budget was quite small.

Filming the first space opera movie was a weird experience. Nobody liked it. The actors were just going to work and joked about their custumes and silly dialogue. The special effect department was often high on drugs. The studio was constantly complaining about production delays and increased costs. The only thing that exceeded Lucas' hopes was the music; at least the space opera would have a great soundtrack. 

Alan Ladd did much work defending his project. His colleagues and bosses ridiculed him for funding the "epic space opera" movie. But Ladd defended well enough to keep the production going. Although it was a struggle in every way, Lucas was allowed to finish his film.

Now 20th Century Fox wanted to earn their money back. Once Lucas handed the 20th Century Fox the final cut for _Star Wars_ the studio was skeptical. After watching it they we’re sure it was a dud. Few thought this space opera would sell.

The first to reject it were movie theaters. Movie theaters and movie studios have a complicated relationship. Back in the day all movie studio's owned theatres; like Netflix does today, studios could produce and exhibit their own stories. But in 1948 the Supreme Court broke up studios from their theates. Both had to become separate businesses.

So studios must first produce a movie, and only afterward can they try to sell it to theatres. Every single movie must be sold to each individual theatre on its own merits. That means Alan Ladd and his colleagues had to sell _Star Wars_ to American movie theaters.

Again no one wanted it this weird space movie. 20th Century Fox was so desperate they broke the law and told theatres they’d get the sure-to-be hit, _The Other Side of Midnight_(1977), if a theatre would take a chance on _Star Wars_.

Thankfully 42 theaters took the bait and put _Star Wars_ on the big screen (_The Other Side of Midnight_ had 431 theaters). There was little marketing, celebrity interviews, or red carpet galas. _Star Wars_ was what _The Other Side of Midnight_ is to you right now; some movie nobody's ever heard of.

On its first week, _Star Wars_ grossed a meager $493,774.

A low figure, but it was enough. The few thousand moviegoers who took a chance on _Star Wars_ wanted to watch it again. And they brought their friends. 

The second week gross was $2,062,644.

And wouldn't you know it, the third week grossed $5,473,681.

And so the trend continued. The studio producers, the theatre buyers, and the filmmaking community were all wrong. Alan Ladd and George Lucas were right; _Star Wars_ was a good movie. The people paid $214,935,293 to watch it, about 10 times its production cost.

Thankfully Lucas got paid. _American Graffiti_ was released when _Star Wars_ was in production, and _American Graffiti was a smash it. Lucas's agent got him a new deal based on his new success ; a $500,000 raise from the studio. Lucas instead asked for the merchandise rights and sequel rights to _Star Wars_, and he got it.

The rest is history. The weird space opera movie turned into a franchise. It’s had many more movies, several television shows, computer games, and all the merchandise Ameica could buy. All told, billions in movie tickets, DVD sales, broadcast rights, streaming rights, games, and merchandise.

That's a history of _Star Wars_. 

So, why did I tell you this story?

You need money right? You're short, the bills are getting high, and you're looking for answers. You can watch cable news and pick someone to blame. Infotainment is great fun, but after you're done watching the blame-fest you'll be in the same place when you started.

Instead, you should reflect on this question.

When you were reading about the making and money behind _Star Wars_, did you once think of yourself? You and your friends and families, across generations, have spent billions funding _Star Wars_. 

What was your return on that investment?

When Lucas sold _Star Wars_ to Disney, he got five billion dollars. 20th Century Fox got one billion. Steven Speilberg got 2.5%. Lots of actors, marketers, lawyers, executives, and more made great money from _Star Wars_.

What did you get? Besides the expectation you'll keep buying more _Star Wars_ stuff? 

As you’re thinking about that question, don't fall into the Left vs. Right narrative trap. This question isn't about "business" vs. "government" or "equality" vs. "equity". This article is a simple observation. You need money today, you've spent billions on the _Star Wars_, have gotten anything material in return?

Was _Star Wars_ a good investment for you?

We've all been raised to be consumers. We're used to making purchases based on impulse, marketing, and trends. Buying whatever you want works fine when credit is cheap. Now we've hit a bump, or perhaps the end, of the era of cheap credit.

To pay you're bills, more of your purchases must become wise investments.

Since _Star Wars_ was released theatre ticket costs have gotten far higher. Most movie production was offshored outside America. Television and movie productions in America get huge government tax-credits and subsidies. Most _Star Wars_ merchandise isn't made in America. Every _Star Wars_ movie since the original has been of worse quality.

These are all bad returns for the public’s investment into the _Star Wars_.

And it was the public who made _Star Wars_ a success. Most of the well-paid experts and stars didn't even want it. Even George Lucas traded 2.5% of future _Star Wars_ returns  to his friend Steven Spielberg who did believe in the movie (half for fun the story goes).

Regular people were the stars of Star Wars and we got a bad deal. It was us who took a chance on an unknown movie that got people into the theater. It was our free of charge word of mouth and enthusiasm that brought in our friends. All of whom funded and sustained the cultural _Star Wars_ phenomenon across generations.

So, after all this investment of time, money, and love put into _Star Wars_, want do you want in return?

That's the question you should ask. It's part of a broader question you should start asking more often. What deal do you want to keep being a consumer in modern America? Online streaming platforms, professional sports, broadcast news, name brand companies, award shows, all of these and many other businesses are not filled with scientists splitting the atom. They are not irreplaceable stars. They're only popular because of your time, attention, and money.

What deal will you negotiate to keep these stars shinning bright? Do you want better quality movies, laxer copyright laws, made in America production quotas. Cheaper movie tickets? The right to repair your electronics? What about a say in what movies get funded?

It's your money, why shouldn't you have a say what movies and shows get produced? The experts barely funded _Star Wars_, why should they have the only power to greenlit a potential movie?

The middle-class needs money to pay our bills. The cost of living rates go up every year and credit is no longer cheap. And among the best options for the middle-class to help itself is our huge untapped political and economic power.

But we won't tap it.

Luke Skywalker is the hero of _Star Wars_. When he decides to stand up for himself, he learns to use a lightsabre and a fighter plane because new and better tools is humanity's source of power and our salvation. 

Luke Skywalker or Princess Leia aren't going to save you. To bring the cost of living rates down we need better deals whenever we sign employment contracts, buy homes, and spend billions watching sports leagues and movie franchises. To get these star deals we need to think ourselves as technological beings who only prosper when holding better tools.

But we don't. We think of themselves as biological beings. When in trouble we try to better themselves via protests about race, gender, and history. These methods are so anti-evolutionary we'll need a galaxy far far away to escape our inability to pay the bills.

Getting our hands on the new technology that'll gives depends on what we buy. Until we constantly buy and demand constant technological evolution we control, our lives and our savings accounts can’t get better.

Luke Skywalker is the hero of _Star Wars_. He was a regular kid, working on a farm, who knew the Empire was evil but he didn't want to learn about the Force or get involved. When he realized you better yourself on the sidelines, he reached for a lightsabre and fighter pilot and any other tool he could find.
