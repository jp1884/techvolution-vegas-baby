Anyone can do this experiment. Put a mirror in front of a dog and watch the animal bark at himself. All the natural instinct to defend himself and his family activates. The self-realization he needs is impossible. He will keep on barking. Dogs cannot see themselves in the mirror.

Only a few animals can. YouTube "mirror test," and you'll see chimps joyously jumping around, elephants peeking into their mouths, and, my favorite, orcas sticking their tongue out and blowing bubbles. Oh, and we humans can of course, see ourselves in the mirror because we're so self-aware.

Are we?

We must be. Put a person in front of the mirror, and we smile, frown, and spend hours applying makeup and working out—no barking at the mirror for us. We're masters of self-reflection.

Unlike dogs, people never yell and scream to warn others of the dangers we see, dangers that end up being shadows.

That's not true. We each sometimes let anxiety, greed, and ignorance taint our eyes and poison our actions. Our politics have even more mistakes. Our history of rallies, demonstrations, marches, and elections is both a hall of fame and shame. Like the dog barking in the mirror, we often get it wrong. 

The difference is the dog is being tricked. Nature didn't invent the mirror, so there's little reason for dogs to be good at using them. To help the dog, we only need to remove the mirror and return her to her natural environment.

To stop us from barking and make us self-aware, we need to do more.

We need to upgrade ourselves to understand our place inside the technological ecosystem we've built.

Life is a beautiful story.

How can it not be, it's the ultimate rags-to-riches tale. Our planet was once totally lifeless. Then over three billion years ago some cells forms in pools of acid. From that ooze, spunky Life created an almost endless list of bacteria, plants, fungi, and animals. Life turned the third rock from the Sun into a rich oasis. But success wasn't, and still isn't, a forgone conclusion. The story of Life has always been very dramatic.

Because Life has a mortal enemy.

That enemy is named entropy, the natural law that makes everything, from stars to mountains, trees to dogs, eventually, degrade into dust. Entropy can act as quickly as an earthquake or as slowly as an ice age, but it's always making the Universe a hard place to live in. Entropy is why Life's rags to riches tale had so many pitfalls, struggles, and five mass extinctions.

And yet, Life survives!

Because Life's representatives heroically fight for every day. And they're smart enough to fight together, which they do inside ecosystems.

No lifeform can go it alone. Overcoming entropy's constant decay requires many adaptations. Many different plants are needed to turn all available sunshine into biomass. Many varied herbivores are required to eat the vegetation and spread seeds. Many unique predators must hunt the herbivores to limit their numbers. Forming an ecosystem requires a long list of lifeforms. 

Once they do, Life is ready for a fight.

Ecosystems are great because they enforce a system of give and take, checks and balances between all species. Life can be cruel to individuals; sadly, some must starve or be eaten, but Life never plays favorites. In nature, no lifeform has inherit power over another. To harvest enough resources, Life needs an ecosystem full of adaptations acting as efficiently as possible. Only then can Life outrun the cold, heat, starvation, and thirst that come as entropy constantly decays the environment.

The story of Life is not a battle of lifeform against lifeform but a mutual race against entropy.

This race is remorseless. If a lifeform finds enough resources in the ecosystem, it will live a few more days. If it doesn't, entropy catches up and kills it. Life doesn't cry for too long. Instead, it substitutes another being with a thicker fur coat, stronger bite, or some other adaptation. This unfettered evolution is how Life finds the most efficient lifeforms possible.

Unfettered innovation is Life's requirement. It's how Life responds to entropy's constant cold snaps, solar flares, and hurricanes. We track evolution inside geological periods. We know that from the Hedean Eon through the Jurassic Period and now the Cenozoic Era, Life has survived because it relentlessly finds new bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals suitable to the current environment. Life only wants lifeforms that outrun entropy.

Isn't that poetic. Life fought the natural law of entropy by creating the natural law of evolution. It is quite poetic and it's also the crux of our problem when we look in the mirror. 

Technology is a new chapter in the story of Life's evolution. While limbs, hooves, jaws, and wings are adaptions and thus akin to tools, they're biological and permanent. 

With technology, Life is no longer limited to permanent biological adaptions. Finally, materials like stone, copper, tin, iron, and silicon can battle entropy in unique new ways. And just as important, Life no longer needed to spend millions of years to create a new biological species to try a new adaption. Humans invent new adaptations and significantly speed up evolution by developing new technologies. Humans create, become, and let die technological species with the forging, gripping, and dropping of a hammer.

When we invented tools, we started to leave biology behind. In the story of Life, we humans, are biological vessels of technological adaptions.

And while technology and biology have their material differences, entropy destroys both all the same. Thus, the requirements of technological evolution are the same as biological evolution. Like its twin, technological Life requires a large mixture of adaptions inside an ecosystem of give-and-take, checks and balances, where no lifeform has dominion over another. Like in biology, constant unfettered evolution is still a fundamental natural law needed to keep technological Life alive.

But being a hero of technological evolution and adaption is not what we see when we look in the mirror.

We see biology. Despite Life anointing us with technology that dwarves the speed and power of biology, when we look at our reflections, we see our biological traits like age, ethnicity, bloodlines, race, and gender. Even worse, we see our place in contemporary society via job titles, culture, and ideology. These are all shadows because they mean so little in the fight against entropy and thus the story of Life.

Seeing biology where we should see technology gets us all messed up. And the more technology we make, the larger the problem gets.

Today our daily commutes span hundreds of miles. Planes zoom us across the planet. Food shows up at our door, ready to eat. Friends are faceless text messages. The result of all this technology is we're surrounded by evermore mirrors that incite our biology in ways our mind can't easily understand. 

Who are our friends? Who are our enemies? Where is our ecosystem?

To a dog, that's an easy question; for us today, it is not. Our worldwide economy requires regular people to have an ever-changing pack of friends, bosses, customers, presidents, kings, policemen, contracts, money, laws, and so much more. All of these are unnatural to a dog and our human biology; it's no wonder many people today dream of a simpler life.

But Life won't let us stay in that prime place of small communities living off the land. Life cares as much about our desires as it did the dinosaurs. Life says to adopt better ways to outrun entropy, or I'll find someone else.

And we aren't.

We are not evolving. Looking into the mirror, we think that Life hung on for 3.7 billion rotations around the Sun so we can drive fast cars, eat junk food, watch fake stories, and have useless meetings. We've been using credit and cheap labour to keep living the same consumerist lifestyle since 1970 without care, enjoying all the reflections of achievement we told ourselves to see in the mirror.

And entropy caught up.

This blog is about why things can't get better. Your job, the rising cost of living, relationships, mental health, trust in government, political partisanship, and many other things will not improve any time soon.

The reason for our pain is the same as it is for any animal that didn't adapt to new times; we're not evolving new adaptions to overcome the pains of everyday life.

We are stuck living an old way of Life centered around non-functioning adaptions that were invented generations ago to solve problems we no longer have. We're like dinosaurs trying to live in an ice age, doomed to suffer. But because we're so self-centered, we use old ideologies to find someone to blame instead of getting to work.

We are in a new Internet Age in the story of life. Things cannot improve because we are not purposefully adapting a new human society to the possibilities of our modern digital technology.

We eventually will. But only after our old society falls apart in a blast of civil wars and revolutions. While Life hates entropy, its destructive tendencies are useful for eliminating old adaptions. Which is what you're experiencing now on daily politics and why there's so much hate within society. We're actively decomposing old technologies, business models, ideologies; an old non-functioning way of life from a old age.

The mechanism that Darwin proposed for evolution is natural selection. Because resources are limited in nature, organisms with heritable traits that favor survival and reproduction will tend to leave more offspring than their peers, causing the traits to increase in frequency over generations. Natural selection causes populations to become adapted, or increasingly well-suited, to their environments over time. Natural selection depends on the environment and requires existing heritable variation in a group.

This is a simple high-school explanation of natural selection And here are the rules of evolution inside ecosystems.

Key points
- An ecosystem consists of a community of organisms together with their physical environment.
- Ecosystems can be of different sizes and can be marine, aquatic, or terrestrial.
- In ecosystems, both matter and energy are conserved. Energy flows through the system—usually from light to heat—while matter is recycled.
- Ecosystems with higher biodiversity tend to be more stable with greater resistance and resilience in the face of disturbances, or disruptive events.

None of these rules are enshrined in our self-perception, expectations, laws, policies, economics, politics, or constitutions because we don't see agents of technological evolution when we look into the mirror. Yet we life of die by the creation of new tools.

Life says to anyone, evolve better adaptions, or die.

We could make technological evolution a part regular part of the human experience. After all, leave someone in nature and they will quickly find and use the best tools to harvest resources. Feeling entropy's hunger and thirst, cold and sweat has a way of cutting through the bullshit. 

But inside society, entropy employs agents of decay. The people whose self-images won't hold up to tests of evolution don't want humanity to race for it. And our acceptance of them is why, despite Life enshrining unfettered evolution as a natural law, things cannot get better any time soon.

I'm working on a book to explain why we're technological species. Seeing ourselves as actors in the story of (technological) evolution well explains much of the human experience.

Seeing ourselves as biological beings leads us astray down the path. We are fine when analyzing evolution or physics. Facts are facts, and we either accept them or not. I avoid words like mysticism, religion, ideology, and culture because it inflames the images in the mirror too much. We need a new philosophy to understand our place in the story of Life.

But the book is a hard one to write. I hope to make it as helpful to understand human evolution as "Origin of Species" was to explain biological evolution. Until then, this blog is a personal therapy whilst living in a world devoted to barking at shadows.

Here are some of the articles to come:

- There is no Lion King
- The Only Problem With Equality Is That It's True.
- What is Racism.
- Meet Entropy's Human Agents (the selfish gene)
- Wear Your Own Fighting Gloves
- Soviet Workplaces Are Still Here
- We Need More Star Deals
- Ricardo's Cheap Labour is an Invasive Species Leading Us to a Dark Age Again

Note this is nothing revolutionary or insulting in this blog. Evolution has worked for billions of years. Advocating for human technological evolution is natural. So, please, if you hate this, don't read it. Although, it's a book your kids will wish you'd read.

##Notes

>Science exists only within a tradition of constant experimental investigation of the natural world. It demands that every hypothesis we formulate be subject to proof, whether in nature or in the laboratory, before we can accept its validity. Men, even scientists, find this type of thinking extremely difficult to sustain. In this sense science is not natural to man at all. It has to be learned.

>Even today, when scientific achievement surround us on every hand and the textbooks of our schools bulge with illustrative experiments, men are, in the mass, still emotional and resitant to fact, particularly in their political and social thinking. We are always more willing to accept mechanical changes in an automobile than revise, or even to examine our racial prejudices, to use just one painful example. We are more willing to swallow a pill that we hope will relax our tensions than to make the sustained, conscious effort necessary to alter our daily living habits.

>The most curious aspect of the technological environment which surrounds us today is one we rarely think about--namely, that it exists. How did it arise and why?

Science created technologies that borderline on magic.

"Invention requires two things: 1. The ability to try a lot of experiments. 2. Not having to live with the collateral damage of failed experiments."

Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon Inc.

>Natural selection is the process through which populations of living organisms adapt and change. Individuals in a population are naturally variable, meaning that they are all different in some ways. This variation means that some individuals have traits better suited to the environment than others. Individuals with adaptive traits—traits that give them some advantage—are more likely to survive and reproduce. These individuals then pass the adaptive traits on to their offspring. Over time, these advantageous traits become more common in the population. Through this process of natural selection, favorable traits are transmitted through generations.

Natural selection can lead to speciation, where one species gives rise to a new and distinctly different species. It is one of the processes that drives evolution and helps to explain the diversity of life on Earth.

- Darwin defined evolution as "descent with modification," the idea that species change over time, give rise to new species, and share a common ancestor.
