Do you like your job? Do customer interactions, coworkers, and paychecks all come together and make you feel appreciated, valued, and wealthy? While I'll never know if you like your job, many Americans don't. So many walked away recently that we called it the Great Resignation.

This blog is an ongoing series about why things can't get better. In this article, I explain why your job won't get better. Your pay won't keep up with inflation. Customers won't start treating you better. And you won't start liking your job more.

To realize this for yourself, you must recognize the difference between being hired to complete a job versus being hired to use a tool.

"What do you do" is a common question in our society. We often ask it anytime we meet someone new. People answer the question with "nurse" or "mechanic." These terms describe a job from the customer's perspective. A nurse nurses a person back to health. A mechanic fixes someone's broken car. 

However, labeling our jobs from the customer's perspective is wrong for most workers today.

My first job was movie usher. One common moviegoer complaint was the huge lines to buy popcorn. After many months of hearing this, I asked my manager why we couldn't sell popcorn at the same time we sell tickets. This would save the second sales transaction and get people popcorn much faster.

Not an original idea. Other workers suggested it and it was implemented many years later. For my time, instead of the easy innovation, we all grew thicker skin to withstand customer complaints.

My first office job was doing data entry. My department would review scanned print newspapers, data enter what was on each page, and sell the information to the print industry as business intelligence.

One day the IT department decided to write us new software. It sucked. The size of each page on our screens was halved. The writing was now so small, it was easy to make mistakes. IT made this new software without even asking for our input. Regardless, we had to use it, even though we wanted to use the old version.

Although I tell people I was an "usher" or "data-entry clerk," that is wrong. I shouldn't label my jobs from the customer's perspective. I wasn't in control of their experience because I didn't control the tools used to solve their problems. Instead I used a broom and garbage bag to clean movie theatres and told people they had to wait in line to buy popcorn. I used a shitty software called "Audit" to enter data.

Labelling, or letting myself be labeled an "usher" or "data-entry clerk," put the responsibility for the customer experience on me, while I, in reality, had little control over it. I was hired to use specific tools and not help improve what customers wanted.

Compare that to a building contractor. When renovating a bathroom you don't care what kind of drill or hammer your contractor uses to renovate your home.

The contractor was hired to complete a job. He's being held to a standard and controls how he finishes the job. It's right to call him a contractor.

You might think, "I was only a movie usher or data entry clerk, so I shouldn't control my tools." To which I respond, even a paperboy can decide how to get the paper to your doorstep.

If Timmy the paperboy, can figure out how to deliver papers faster, he'll make more money. That doesn't automatically mean Timmy will like his job, but it does mean he can make changes when he's unhappy. Timmy and the contractor have professions.

Workers with no control over their tools can't. These aren't professions. They're employments. And they're the basis of most jobs today. And being told what tools to use is the nature of employment. So is being given production quotas. It'll even say so in the employment contract.

[Skunkworks quote]

All employers control the tools their employees use; some take this responsibility seriously. Well-run factories agonize over every minute of a worker's time. There's also a machinist or engineer nearby to assess proposed changes from workers. But many, likely most, employers don't care about their worker experience. Instead, they own aging equipment, refuse to invest in more efficient tools, and hire more people to make up for lagging productivity, something that depresses workers value and happily bulges the management ranks. When customers are unhappy, the management blames their employees with a gaslighting phrase, "you're not meeting expectations."

Not controlling your tools is why your pay won't increase, customers won't appreciate you more, and your job won't get better. To improve any of these, you must have input and say in the tools you use.

You already know how valuable this freedom is.

Americans enjoy working in their homes, learning new skills, and buying new tools. Renovating a home, training in kickboxing, and tinkering with a 3D printer take lots of time and effort. Americans do these challenging tasks willingly because we're in charge and thus are free to research what teachers, products, and tools work best for us.

Human happiness needs the freedom to choose our tools. People free to pick their own tools will make mistakes, buy too much, or get sucked into the wrong trend. But with freedom, we can correct our errors. I can prove it to you. Let's look at another economy that told workers and consumers what products to buy and use. Without surprise, the people inside grew very unhappy.

The Soviet Union was a federation of socialist countries. It existed from  1920 to 1991. It had a storied history filled with lessons. It was a society without open elections, private property, or market prices. In most every way, individuals at home or work were not free to choose their tools. That's because the entire economy was planned by someone far away.

A planned economy is when an unbiased person determines what products should be made and purchased and what they should cost. Coming together in an enormous bureaucracy, these impartial and trained bureaucrats plan out every power plant, factory, grocery store, shoe, etc., to be made in the economy.

Central planning proved okay at building large products like roads and power plants. It did provide uniform education and medical services too. But it was hopelessly incapable of making quality or abundant products. The unbiased bureaucrat never materialized. Instead, bureaucrats used their power to run things for [their own benefit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem). As one Soviet citizen said, the bureaucrats "had special stores with well-stocked shelves and pleasant price labels. Runny faucets in their apartments were fixed in no time at all, waiting time for new telephone line was measured in days, not years". He went on to say "All this relieved the top guys from the sad routine [regular people did] of non-stop foraging and hoarding."

![Leader v people](pics "a title")

The result was a Soviet bureaucratic "elite" who shopped in exclusive stores. Ordinary store shelves lacked quality choices. And workplaces that got less efficient each year.

And no one had any choice but to accept it. Soviet consumers and workers had to make do with what Soviet bureaucrats provided. Our current supply chain problems are nothing in comparison. Soviet workers had the stress of meeting unrealistic production quotas. Workers were forced to game the system because criticizing their crappy tools was akin to criticizing those in charge. Since there was no feedback from the people, those in charge were ignorant of the reality on the frontline. 

That's why by 1982, the Soviet leader said of this fellow bureaucrats, "We don't know the society in which we live." While Soviet workers said, "We pretend to work, and they pretend to pay us."

The free market is, of course, the rival to central planning. It embraces private property and encourages individuals to own property and trade their stuff at prices they determine. Prices of food, appliances, and electricity are determined by what another free-thinking individual is ready to pay for it.

The free market has problems, mainly the frequent recessions and depressions unheard of in a planned economy. However, the cycle of busts and booms often sweeps away the old and fosters innovation, providing more abundance to improve the situation of the poorest people. The constant creation of the free market is why centrally planned economies routinely bought or stole products from free-market economies.

Central planning and free-market economics battled it out in the Cold War between America and the Soviet Union, which lasted from 1945 to 1991. That war had numerous nuclear standoffs, massive military buildups, and spying. Despite all the tension, the war ended when Soviet officials visited the West in the 1980s.

The first time Soviet bureaucrats walked through the aisles of American grocery stores–filled with food, meats, and pastries–they knew their system was wrong.

The average American ate better than the most potent Soviet official. The Soviet elite didn't like feeling so small; they wanted this wealth.

Soon Soviet citizens watched videotapes of the same grocery stores. They awoke from their matrix and could never go back to waiting in line for poor-quality products and jobs that took up their time but didn't pay the bills.

It wasn't long until the Soviet Union collapsed and free-market economics took over in the former Soviet Union (although the transition wasn't done well, to say the least). 

In any regard, America won the Cold War because the American consumer was free to choose what product worked best for them.

And now, they need the same freedom at work.

You might be thinking; we don't live in the Soviet Union!

No, of course not. You can vote and buy whatever you want. But if you're an employee, your working with products someone else told you to. For most Americans, our jobs, livelihood, and the majority of our life is spent using tool someone else put into our hands.

It seems so natural for us to be handed working tools. But that's not much different than the Soviets using bad products at home and work. Americans are shopping in a free market but work inside an economy centrally planned by the few inside the head offices of the American economy.

And that's where the source of worker underpaying, awful customer experience, and unhappiness lies. We, as American consumers, are free to buy and test out any product we want. But as American workers, we are not. Thus, American frontline workers can't evolve solutions to fix the problems they face when trying to service their customers.

It's someone else, far away in a bureaucratic head office, that tells us what tools to use. Employees do the cooking, cleaning, and servicing but need more control over our jobs. When we fall behind production quotas or get lousy customer service reviews, we're blamed, while the tools are never; that would accuse those who control them.

The people inside America's head office, marketing, human resources, and IT are centrally planned bureaucrats, not the unbiased bureaucrats they're supposed to be. Their choices are judged by the person above them and not the worker on the frontline solving problems. They may consider customer complaints but don't interact with or take responsibility for the customer experience daily.

It's no surprise most of the tools used by American employees suck. If they were sold on the free market, they wouldn't sell. Like the Soviet Union, today's corporate planned economy has high proclamations about innovation, but it gets most of its innovation from the free market of the consumer economy. The internet, iPhone, online messages, Linux, and so many other tools used in corporate America today are all consumer products.

Expecting workers to choose their tools isn't radical. As already mentioned, when a person is hired to complete a job, they can use their tools. That's why small business owners, tradesmen, farmers, and even paperboys have much freedom over their jobs.

Home Depot offers tool freedom to contractors and homeowners. Microcenter offers it to programmers and gamers. The construction and computer industry establishes high standards via organizations such as the Canadian Standards Association and the USB Implementors Forum to ensure whatever product a person chooses is safe and interoperable.

So, if anyone with authority can't imagine what a free market of tools should look like in their industry, they should step down. Because they are the bureaucrat suffocating the American economy the same way the Soviet officials smothered theirs.

But that won't happen. The Soviet officials only allowed change because they wanted the obvious wealth of the free market for themselves. And since they could copy and import America's products and the free market (not politics), these Soviet powerbrokers could (and did) maintain their position. The Soviet people were appeased with a free-market consumer economy that finally got them the full store shelves they saw on video.

We don't have another country to show us a better way. Whatever comes next in human evolution is unknown. There's no reason for those in power to let the race to invent the future be an open competition.

And so American employees suffer. But since they think of themselves as biological beings, they try to better themselves via protests about race, gender, and history. They should demand the freedom to control their tools again because we are technological beings.

No one, be it consumers or workers, will ever have complete control over the tools we use. Budgets, availability, and expertise all affect what products we use. But we need to shift our focus from biology to technology. Because better tools are responsible for higher productivity, wages, and happiness, we need to enjoy our jobs and lives again.

Ideally, we'd have a bill of rights and constitutional amendments to protect our access to new and better tools. We can't sign away our political rights in any contract. Nor should we be forced to sign away our economic ones. Until then, we need the self-realization that your tools determine our fate.

Until we reach for and protect our human technological evolution, our lives, and our jobs can't get better.
