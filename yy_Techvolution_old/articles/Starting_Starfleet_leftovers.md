## Backpage

We'll conceptualize digital tools totally detached from the Industrial Age. These products will make The Computer Age lifestyle one of "perpetual profit." We'll send the massive savings to Musk and his protegees and hence, start Starfleet.

_"...I was one of those people who needed validation in the popular culture when I was growing up and and that's the power of the medium that's one of the things that we're able to do is by telling these stories giving ourselves an idea that you know it's all good we're all in this together that there's a place for you that's what Star Trek represents to people when the future comes there's a place for you and that we will have reached and a part of our evolution as a species where race and class and sex and how much you make a year all of those will have been overcome those are no longer the things that we are so concerned with on a day-to-day basis there's a principle in Star Trek called edik an acronym IDIC infinite diversity in infinite combination and in jeans vision there was an inherent respect for all of the diversity that exists as life throughout the cosmos that's a world I want to live in you"_

# Introduction

## Reminder

**I. A New Philosophy:** This part upgrades our political philosophy to the Computer Age. It gets Main Street to see the big picture that they're all player gods who must use digital tools to solve their own problems.

**II. Building the Life Star:** Explains the new political and economic truth we'll see in the Computer Age with technologies like apps, bio-monitors, and big data. With these and other digital tools, we'll be able to create much more objective definitions of political and economic right and wrong. The Life Star will therefore remove phantom storytelling from our politics. In short, the Life Star will do for politics and economics what scientific instruments did for physics, chemistry, biology, etc. The troubling part is many people won't accept what this new telescope shows us.

**III. Starting Starfleet:** We'll conceptualize digital tools totally detached from the Industrial Age. These products will make The Computer Age lifestyle one of "perpetual profit." We'll send the massive savings to Musk and his protegees and hence, start Starfleet.

## Techvolution

There's never an s in evolution. It's ongoing. Never stops. And thus there is no s in techvolution, because unlike revolutions, techvoluion is constant, our adaptations never stop.

## Our Banquets and Balls

Thought experiment. How did Douglas know freedom was better. How could Techvoluion in 1841 have predicted 1941. Humanity as a character, adapts to technology change, the grandstory. Thus if we predict we'll be on Mars, the moon one day, that means we'll have the technology to do so, and thus we'll have had to adapt to this space/Tesla/SpaceX technology to get it. So what society will Mars require of us on Earth to live.

[note, do that as Douglass, than do it for us today, by posing a question "what will Mars require of us, and then proceed to critique what's in the way of mars today, gasoline, cars as transport, one-use everything, limited access industries, complex tax codes, gold, and whatever...

So Part II, is a thought experiment... Life on Mars]

- Note how protagonists, ex YouTube traversy media and real engineering, are self motivated without getting much help. now that DB is gone, we can give them lots.
- Money is the distance maker from the frontline. not in nature of course, human made rules say it doesn't expire, about that....
- read The Man Behind the Microchip, pg 182, people don't need products (drill bits), they need a way to drill 10 million holes, speaks to the triangle vs circle, items are merely temporary problem solvers.

## Stuff

Gene Roddenberry's vision for the future had to do with mankind being at a at a better place he felt that Wars and poverty and sickness were all things that were over with and that man could spend his time seeking a better quality of life he saw human beings as being beyond petty petty arguments which made things quite difficult because in when you're writing drama you you want conflict and gene and want conflict within the core characters of the show so it had to come from outside so that was probably the biggest rule and the hardest rule for for the writing staff we also had to follow to two separate rules of science the the real rules of science to whatever degree we could follow them and the fictitious rules of science that had been set up by Star Trek by the original series and by however much of the new series had come before and it was it was very interesting because we had people working with us who were really experts at science and who would help us with things but then there was you know the things like transporters and warp speed and photon torpedoes and all these things that don't exist but that still had a set of rules attached to it so it was a it was a continual challenge and it was very often very difficult to have to go back to the writers to say you can't do this when in fact they were doing something that seemed perfectly reasonable considering how much stuff within the show was just made up mmm-hmm love the fact that so many of the fans would certainly catch it the roll was broken yeah we once had a phaser come out of photon torpedo port in a visual effect and I certainly didn't know the difference and we got hundreds of letters hundreds you

well visual effects for many decades were done with live-action models and stop action and the reason was that to do it digitally was just too expensive and when we first started next-generation almost all the ship shots you see are in fact models actual wooden meticulously painted models that are that are photographed and made to look like they're doing all kinds of exciting things so in the beginning by the second season our post-production supervisor Peter Lauritzen who was an absolute genius at this stuff realized that we could afford to do certain shots in using computer animation and as the cost of computer animation came down the percentage of shots ended up getting greater and greater and by the time we finished next generation we were doing 100% of our work with with digital compositing and with computers so maybe with the exception of the first one or two seasons of ds9 all of the rest of ds9 and and and voyager and enterprise were we're done digitally and each year the ability to do something a little bit better the price came down so our animation and our special effects just got better and better as we went along I would have to imagine the budget for the effects that would still be a large chunk of the overall budget it was a
