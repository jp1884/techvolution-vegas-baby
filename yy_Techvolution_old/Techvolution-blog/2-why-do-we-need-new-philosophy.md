The Korean peninsula is a region in East Asia. It's divided into two countries; North Korea and South Korea. Both countries say they're the true government for all of Korea. That's a significant disagreement, so there's a very militarized border (bunkers, guns, and barb-wire) between the two.

All Koreans have the same history, culture, and language. The only real difference is the political philosophy of North and South. Broadly speaking, Marxism underpins North Korea, while capitalism and liberal democracy are the philosophies of South Korea.

The point is if you were born in North or South Korea, you'd live very differently. What you thought about property, government, religion, and almost everything else in day-to-day life would be different. All because of a different philosophy rules your society.

The divide between North and South Korea isn't unique. The DMZ is just a more extreme example of human nature. A person from South America or North America has a different way of seeing their worlds. Same thing if you're rich or poor, or from the big city or small town. All these, and many others, differences make the huge ecosystem of political opinions in our world today.

There is another difference I didn't mention yet. Time. Someone born "in the old days" usually has much different politics than someone younger. Older generations are less likely to accept two men marrying each other.

This divide between political philosophies and time is why I invented Techvolution. Because we really need to realize how different the world is today.

The Iron Age lasted until about 500 BC when the Classical Age took over until 500AD. The Middle Ages was 500-1400. Then the Renaissance was until then the Science Age, Industrial Age.

Each Age was marked by how technology empowered human civilization. It's a hard break-in time even more substantial than the divide between North and South Korea.

The personal computer was invented in 1969, the same year as the internet. Since then, we've been increasingly living in the Internet Age. And just as someone born in the Middle Age lived differently than someone born in the Science Age, so do we. How a modern person sees property, government, religion, and day-to-day life are fundamentally different.

A Middle-Age person used the Bible and superstition to understand their world. A science person used a telescope and mathematics. Today we're using the internet, smartphones, social networks, and all the other wonders of modern tech.

Yet we don't have a new philosophy for our new Age.

The Marxism of North Korea was invented in 1848. The Capitalism of South Korea was created in 1776, while Conservatism in 1790, Progressivism in 1859.

All our philosophies today were invented during the Industrial Age that ended in 1969.

Techvolution is a new philosophy. A new way to see the world. It takes the lessons of evolution invented in 1859, applies it to human societies. This blog will help you update our society to a new age.

Because as we'll learn, the Internet Age needs a lot more heroes in the story of civilization.
