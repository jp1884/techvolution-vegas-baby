Star Wars bar scene. The one where they find Solo. As Obi-Wan goes to find a pilot, and Luke is alone at the bar. This is a inserted scene, where Obi-wan tests Luke, to see if he's ready, to see if he's a protagonist.

Luke has three tests, and with the Mind Trick, he's made honest, so he's telling three strangers his motivations.

1st test he fails. He's being differential and unsure.
2nd test, he gets angry at the Empire, and stands up for freedom.
3rd test, he is positive, confident, and ready to say he believes in something that doesn't exist. In fact, he's going to be the one who makes freedom and liberty actualized.

Passing the test, Obi-wan returns to Luke, saying he's found a pilot; Han Solo.
