(article already in Build the Lifestar)

The bs of old philosophies/ways of fighting were quickly exposed when all the human made rules of Judo, Akido, Taikwondo, boxing, wrestling (less so), were thrown away and the result, victory or defeat, was the evidence of effectiveness.

But...

"i thought you guys would like to hear the story i know you fellow wrestlers know exactly what i'm talking about it's either real or it's not it's very early on in the sport of mixed martial arts when the logical assumption from the marketing team is that you're going to get every taekwondo  student every karate student every judo practitioner and every aikido and they're just going to absolutely love this it ended up being the absolute opposite all of those arts that i just named that
turned out to not be real or at least real in terms of their effectiveness in actual combat steered as far away from it as they could beg their students not to watch found out a number of different reasons why this is too violent or too whatever their excuse was because they didn't like what they were finding out they had bought into it they had spent their life they had mastered some of these movements to only find out that it was a waste of time" Chael Sonnen  2 Apr 2021

Now for the last story. Humanity has many martial arts. Karate, kickboxing, wrestling, jiu-jitsu, judo, and boxing being among the most common today. Each of these disciplines use the same human body, but teach certain techniques like punching or choke-holds to defeat their opponents. When competing each discipline creates rules that say only their techniques are allowed; there's no kicking in a boxing match for example.

In the early 1990's the fight community started to ask whose system system was best: would a boxer beat a kickboxer? What would happen if a wrestler fought a karate guy? What these people were asking is what if we threw away the rule book and just fought a fight.

On reflection, it seems funny that this was an original idea, but before the 1990's people just assumed boxers or wrestlers weren't allowed to fight outside their rulebook. Fighters were supposed to be ideological loyal and pure to their discipline, even if getting their ass kicked in a real fight.

So the fight community threw out all their rulebooks held many "no rules" tournaments; the most popular being the Ultimate Fighting Championship. After several years these tournaments found their answer. No martial art was the best. Meaning the best fighters were ones who trained all disciplines and used whatever technique they thought would defeat their opponent based on the exact moment they were fighting them. A large toolbox of techniques and the open mind to adapt as fast as possible proved to be the best system. This realization was the start of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA). It's so effective its practioners will defeat any other kind of fighter.

Here's what we should take from these three stories. The middle-class has many systematic problems that keep getting worse. Today we often decide our politician based on their "red", "blue", "green" or whatever ideology. And this is why we're getting our asses kicked.

Because we believe in one ideology, we think our lives are governed by the ideological rule book. Even though all of today's ideologies centuries ago. The answer to what's best is "mixed ideological politics". Meaning not having loyalty to one ideology, but to only care about problem-solving.

That's what Techvolution is. It's a rebellion inside your mind that realizes you are a lifeform in Nature, and thus no rule apply except those that help you solve practical everyday problems. Humans evolve with tools, so your job is to solve frontline pain to evolve life on Earth. And when someone says you're not allowed you have to fight back, even if only in your mind, because they are just being assholes. 

That's why Techvolution is. Is the rebellion inside your mind that says life isn't a ideological fight anymore than a streetfight is a boxing match. The truth is all lifeforms are free to use whatever means neccesary to win in Nature. Thus no rules apply that don't help you live a better life. Since humanity evolves with tools, new tools should be protected and allowed to prospser based on how valuable the people no involved, the extras, find them. Until Techvolution is our ruling philosophy, our society will keep supressing new ideas like a spoiler on racing car, and end up being like ostrichs running away instead of evolving a solution.


This new philosophy gives you the freedom of mind to mix and match ideologies as needed to overcome any political or economic problem you face. Be it a dreadful morning commute, climate change, or government red tape.

This new philosophy might be called mixed ideological politics; here's what that means.
