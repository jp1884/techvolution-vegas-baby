I study technological innovation. I want to understand what helps create new technology and what prevents new technology from being developed. It can be hard to research innovation because human self-interest taints our perspective. Humans have so many cultures, politics, ideologies, and religions knowing what helps and hurts innovation is hard to see. It is usually easier for humans to make excuses for their society's failure instead of making improvements.

To help me better study innovation, I'm comparing technological innovation to biological evolution.

The original spiral image is biologists understanding of evolution. When biologists study evolution, there is no favoritism. We accept that as the environment changes, natural selection chooses the best lifeforms to survive in the environment. Any creature that can't compete doesn't survive.

That's why the original spiral is seamless and has no steps. Because we understand evolution very well, we accept moving from the Jurassic Period to the Cretaceous Period means the death of most dinosaurs. Millions of species go extinct, and we accept it with no excuses because that's what evolution does. Life continually adapts new creatures to survive in the environment.

But from the perspective of a species, evolution isn't a seamless progression from one age to the next age. For example, a Tyrannosaurus never left the period in which it evolved. They stayed in Cretaceous Period until they all died.

By separating the spiral into steps, we are looking at evolution from the perspective of an individual species. A ladder connects each step because only a few lifeforms make it from one period to the next. The ones who can't go up the ladder are stuck. That is what the circle at the end of each step represents. The circle is the time when creatures like Tyrannosaurus keep living ("going in circles" is an English saying to describe living but going nowhere) until they die out.

I use the spiral divided into steps to represent humanity's technological evolution. Our travel through technological ages, like the Bronze Age to the Iron Age, is comparable to the change from Jurassic Period to the Cretaceous Period. To fully evolve, we must forget most of our old way of life, climb the ladder and innovate new technology to survive in the new age.

Using biology, I want to explain how technological innovation is like evolution.

Here is the above explanation explained using the steps. The green line represents the lifeforms that climb the ladder as they evolve through each age. The red line represents the lifeforms that will never evolve and keep going in circles until they die and become fossils.

## Three Act Structure Graphs

As we learned in Mamet's class and his _Pig: The Movie_, every story is make believe. The question is how good will the fabrication be. The elements above, from props to plot, are what's needed to complete the illusion. Like a gourmet meal, once these incredients are properly balanced they all but disappear into a seemingly simple, but elegantly executed, creation.

Thus, every element must come together to a simple story. Star Wars is about a farm boy standing up to evil. Cinderella is about a women overcoming oppression. _The Matrix_ is about a man redefining his reality. _Pig: The Movie_ is about a father protecting his family. _Breaking Bad_ is about a good man descending into darkness.

You can see these stories in character names. Luke Skywalker rises above to fight darkness. Neo is the word for new because he's newly risen above his ignorance. Walter White appears to be a clean man. Sam Malone the consumate ladies man of _Cheers_, is always alone. The psychiatrist Frasier Crane always supports people in their lives. Even real life people can have poetic names, the con-artist Bernie Madoff, made off with his customer's money.

These character names also signify the problem of their respective stories. Will Luke overcome the empire? Will Neo survive the oppression of new ideas. Will Walter White keeping descending into darkness. Will Sam Malone ever find love?

Because all functional stories are about overcoming a specific problem, they thus have a beginning, middle, and end. The first act is the introduction of the problem and the protagonist who fights to overcome it and the antagonist who fights against the protagonist. The second act is where both characters and their supporters fight over the problem. And in the third act, the question of which side will win is answered in the climax. Throughout this process, drama is created by constant questions about how the events will progress and whether the problem will be overcome.

Here is how a three act story is structured.

### Good, Spectacle, and Art Summary

All storytelling mediums, from printing presses, movies, and streaming start off as spectacle and art. Spectacle content helps attract the attention needed to kickstart a new technology. While making art attracts creators to the new technology.

For example, movies started in the 1910s as Kinetoscopes; vending machines that showed short clips of boxers or ballet dancers. The novelty of a movie was a huge attaction at the time. By 1930s creators were practiced enough and movie technology was good enough that movies became good stories that were Shakespearan in their quality. The movies were most popular between the 1930s-1950s when their storytelling was consisently of a high quality. Similar to today's HBO and Netflix content.

Sadly, the good times usually don't last for movies. As time passes, a new storytelling technology tells better stories, and the owners of the old technology fall back into a mixture of spectacle and art. This is what happened to movies for the last few decades. As television got better, Hollywood turned towards spectacle franchise movies and weird art films. This devolvtion into spectacle and art maintained some interest. Unsurprisingly though, movie audience got smaller every year as people found good stories for a cheaper price on Netflix.
