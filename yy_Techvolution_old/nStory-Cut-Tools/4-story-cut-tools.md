# Story-Cut Tools

Now you know storytelling. A story is a series of events where a character works hard to overcome a problem. Storytellers must resist the urge to be self-indulgent and trick their audience with atttemps at being interesting, and only tell the story essential steps to the hero conquering their one goal.

Staying on target isn’t easy. Stories are created over many hours. Throughout writing sessions a creator must stay disciplined. Whether sick, hungry, or living through a war, the writer must detach from their feelings and stick to their story's throughline.

Creating a a good story is therefore crueling. The turn to interesting scenes like grosteque gore or self-indulgent talk is the mark of a writer not willing to stay in the dirt and work hard to create. 

Is a story good or not? Does it function well or is it self-indulgent. We can take the lessons of Mamet and Aristotle’s take on storytelling and make some tools to showcase quality or indulgence.

Steering away from the cult of self will be a bit easier after learning these tools.

## The Ingredients

Aristotle listed the components of a story. They are listed below.

### Props
Props are the visual apparatus of the play. Sets, costumes, effects are all kinds of props. They each increase the spectacle of things to look at. Props are just there. They have no meaning themselves. They fade usually into the back ground.

Of course some items don’t fade into the background. Occasionally a set will be beautiful and attract attention. However, clothing, chairs, rings, and other spectacle make the story look pretty but don’t have any direct relevance to the story.

### Passions
What must Cinderella be feeling when first dancing with prince charming. What was it like when Luke Skywalker escapes the Death Star? Or when the pig returns home with a new wife?

There's no way to feel another person's emotions. So, how can a storyteller communicate those emotions to an audience?

Music.

Music communicates the passions of a storys. A great example is the “Jaws” theme, which creates suspense in the audience with just a few notes that are so powerful people today still fear the water because of them.

Another example is The Lord of the Rings, whose great score almost tells the story itself. Take a listen below. Jump around the music and you can feel where you are in the story. Such is the power of music to transfer the emotions from one person inside a story to another wanting to know what that story feels like.

### Dialogue
Dialogue is how the characters communicate their thoughts to each other and sometimes themselves. Dialogue should always advance the story and not be meaningless words.

That’s why the most memorable moments of a movie is often its best lines. “Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.”, “Do you feel lucky punk?”, and “May the force be with you”.

Dialogue is how we find out what the characters want, be it finding the destroying the Death Star, marrying prince charming, or selling a pig.

### Antagonist
While props, music, and dialogue communicate the story to the audience, it’s the characters who live the story. Fans of the story will see themselves as one of its character.

Every character must be consistent in their characteristics and beliefs and any changes to their character must be explained, which normally means explaining how the events of the plot changed and therefore revealed a character as being, strong-willed, loving, hateful, cowardly, or in the pig’s case, persistent. 

Every story has a problem to overcome. The antagonist personifies the problem. He likes the way the world is and doesn't want anything to change. 

This antagonist steps up and defends the status quo. There’s no doubt in his mind that change is bad for himself and society. That is a crucial point. Antagonists don’t think of themselves as being evil. They fight for the worldview they believe in.

### Worldview
Socrates was the first philopher. Born in ancient Athens, he became famous for asking simple questions. He’d ask “what is love?” or “what is justice”. These questions imply love or justice have a specific form like a chair or bicycle. Socrates found deeper meanings to our concepts like politics, ethics, and morality. Many followers loved Socrates dearly.

Other people weren’t so impressed. They didn’t see the forms Socrates was talking about and thought Socrates was not educating the youth, but corrupting them.

Socrates caused such a stir because he was probing the established worldview of his society. Our worldview surrounds us everyday. How should the calender be setup, who controls government, how are children educated. Our way of life is not laws of nature. They are choices written into rules by a human. When put together all these rules make a worldview.

Just think of the differences between India and Japan, city living and country living, rich and poverty. Each is different because each place has a different worldview.

Likewise, every story has a worldview. While antagonists and their supporters defend it, heroes and their supporters want to change it.

### Protagonist
Some people can see errors in the worldview. Socrates of course saw errors, but he only ever asked questions to uncover problems and come to better answers. Other people ask questions but then take action. For example, Cinderellla wants to be a princess, Luke wants to destroy the Empire, the pig owner wants to protect his family.

The hero works to change the world. This drive reveals who their supporters are, and who the antagonists are. But the heroes of a story not philosophers like Socrates. They don’t ask questions and write down new social rules and call it a day. Heroes see a problem with the world and want to improve it by enforcing a new worldview.

But how do they do that?

### Plot
A worldview gives people a rulebook to follow. Most people will follow it, but who enforces these rules for when people don't. The antagonists of course, and they enforce their rules not only with words, but by controlling the levers of power in a story.

Let's use _Cinderella_ as an example. Near the end of the story, the Prince is looking for the girl he danced with at the ball. Told to visit each house in the land, the King's supporters are about to enter Cinderella's home. However, the wicked step-mother tells Cinderella she's not good enough for the prince and isn't allowed to speak with him. When Cinderella disregards these rules, she's locked up in the attic and can't leave because she doesn't have the key.

The key is the lever of power. A lever of power is a prop elevated to super-importance because it has the power to control what happens in the story. And that's what a plot is, the series of struggles to control the levers of power.

Returning to Cinderella locked in the attic. Her entire story depends on a simple key. What was once a prop is elevated to a lever of power. Once Cinderella's friends get her the key, the key returns to being just a another prop.

The same thing applies to the glass slipper. What was once a orament to a glamours dress, is the ultimate lever of power to make Cinderella's story into a fairy tale.

Whoever controls the levers controls the story. They write the rules because they can enforce the rules. The levers are can be as simple as a glass slipper or as devastating as the Death Star, but controling them is what the plot is about.

The plot to control levers of power has different sections:

- Beginning: Also called the first act. The beginning is where the story starts with introduction of the problem, characters, and the plot. As Mamet says the story should begin as soon as the action starts and does not need any backstories. In the beginning the antagonist will usually their control of levers of power that cause trouble for the hero.

- Middle: The second act starts as soon as the hero begins their quest to change who controls the levers of power. The middle is where the antagonist and hero gather their forces and exchange blows, losses, and learn their lessons.

- End: In the third act, protagonist and antagonist decide to risk it all for control of lever of power that decides the fate of the story. The end is commonly called the climax. It concludes with the new reality, whatever it may be.

In addition to to having a beginning, middle, and end a story's plot also has features. Three of the most important are below.

- Suffering of the hero: We call protagonists heroes for a good reason. Changing the worldview of a story isn't easy. It's necessary that every main character suffers in their story. Experiencing their pain is how audiences learn to emphasize with the plot.

- Reversal of situations: The plot leads us to many directions. The mixture of good and bad news mark the battle between good and evil for control of the levers of power. Reversals are often a stories most impactful moments. From Cinderella getting her chance to attend the ball, to her trying on the slipper at the end. Reversals play with our expectations and incite our emotions.

- Realizations: As the plot unfolds, from beginning to end, filled with suffering and reversals, realizations are the moments when plot points are made official. When we see Cinderella reveal her glass slipper, we realize her life is about to change.

## Story Components Summary

As we've learned, every story is about a hero seeing a problem with the world and acting to change it, which means wanting to control a lever of power. Since debates don’t change much, true heroes attack the lever of power by destroying, seizing, or creating new tools to take control of their society.

Props and effects fill out the story. Music helps communicate emotions to the audience, while dialogue communicates intentions of the characters. The worldview describes the motivations of the characters. Antagonists want to preserve the worldview while heroes want to change it. The back and forth battle is the plot filled with suffering of the hero, reversal of situations, and realization. 

Incidents to control levers of power should be logical and follow naturally from the actions that precede them. The incidents will be more satisfying to the audience if they come as a surprise, and if the audience at first thinks them to be coincidence; soon, however, the audience must see them as plausible, even necessary.

And that’s what a story is. A series of beats and scenes that come together to make a plot where the hero and villian battle for control over a lever of power. In Cinderella those levers are a ticket to the ball, clothes to wear to it, the key to the attic, and finally the glass slipper. Stars Wars, Pig: The Movie, and every other story have their own levers of power.

The winner of the story is whoever controls the levers of power in the end.

## Story Components Triangle

<template v-if="pigtri">
<p>Pig: The Movie Triangle</p>

![Pig: The Movie Triangle](/assets/img/triangle-pig-the-movie.png)

**Items:** A farm house, the cart of the salesman, the farm, and the restaurant are among the props of the story.

**Passions:** Farmer John's desire to keep his family safe. And the pig's desire to find a wife are the passions of the story.

**Dialogue:** The dialogue of Star Wars stood out when it was released. Filled with techno terms and weird alien names. But it’s memorable and most definitely communicated the story to the audience. Some of worlds most known words are from this space opera, “I find your lack of faith disturbing” and “may the Force be with you.”  

**Antagonist:** The Pig is the antagonist here. He refuses to behave the way farmer John wants.

**Worldview:** The worldview is farmer John owns the pig and demands he acts in safe way around the farm.

**Hero:** Farmer John is the hero, he sees a problem with his worldview of owning a dangerous pig and seeks out to solve his problem.

**Plot:** Farmer John wants someone else to take ownership of the pig. But he needs some money in return. The lever of power is the leash and ownership he has over the pig, and the multiple attempts to try to exhange ownership for money. The pig of course antagonizes every sale, until, to our surprise, he starts to behave when getting what he wants, a wife.
</template>

<template v-if="cintri">
<p>Cinderella Triangle</p>

![Cinderella Triangle](/assets/img/triangle-cinderella.png)

**Items:** The story is set in medieval central Europe. A farm house, palace, countryside are among the props. Of course so are the magical wardrobe, pumpkin coach, and glass slippers.

**Passions:** The passions of the story are the hopes and dreams of Cinderella, and the wicked plans of her step-family.

**Dialogue:** Cinderella talks to her only friends, the farm animals and her fairy godmother. The wicked plans are spoken by her family, while the prince and his supporters also say some stuff.  

**Antagonist:** The step-mother, and step-sisters are Cinderella's antagonists. They suppress the hero to keep themselves on top.

**Worldview:** The worldview is isolation and disempowerment over the poor in the story. While the King is a royal, he uses his power to seek justice for his people. However, the evil step-family abuse their control over Cinderella for her oppression and their gain.

**Hero:** The farm animals, the fairy godmother, and of course Cinderella are the heroes of this story. Each sees a problem with the world and acts to change it.

**Plot:** Cinderella has no name or wealth. Her society values both. Thus the story of our liberation are tools that empower her. First it's the creation of clothes, staff, and carriage so she can attend the ball. Afterwards its the key to the attic and glass slipper that saves the day. Controlling these are what the plot is all about.
</template>

<template v-if="swtri">
<p>Star Wars Triangle</p>

![Star Wars Triangle](/assets/img/triangle-star-wars.png)

**Items:** Props range from the a farm in the desert, to space ships, and space stations. There are also fighter jets, lasers, costumes of the famous Imperial Stormtroppers.

**Passions:** Since the audience can’t feel the touch of a real lightsaber for the first time or the fear of enemy fighters shooting missles at you, music evokes that passions for us. Star Wars has some of the most iconic ever made.

**Dialogue:** The dialogue of Star Wars stood out when it was released. Filled with techno terms and weird alien names. But it’s memorable and most definitely communicated the story to the audience. Some of worlds most known words are from this space opera, “I find your lack of faith disturbing” and “may the Force be with you.”  

**Antagonist:** Perhaps the most famous character in movies. Darth Vader was in control, using his sith powers to control the ultimate lever of power, the Death Star, to enforce his control over the galaxy. Darth Vader likes the world as it is and fights to keep it from changing.

**Worldview:** The thought of Star Wars is the Force. It is the mystical power in the story. The good Jedi harness it to empower people with freedom and knowledge. The evil Sith like Darth Vader use the Force to impose their dictatorship over the galaxy.

**Hero:** Princess Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Han Solo, and Luke Skywalker are all heroes of the story. Each sees the world controlled by the empire, wants the world to change, and takes action to change it. Luke is the main hero not because he takes the most risk but because he’s the one who has the biggest effect on the plot.

**Plot:** The Death Star is the ulimate lever or power. And it’s blueprints drive the plot of the story. Princess Leia stole them and enlists help to deliver them to the rebels. Obi-Wan, Luke, and Han help her deliver the plans. Ultimately, it's Luke who uses the Force to destroy the Deathstar and change the world.

</template>

<template v-if="maxtri">
<p>The Matrix Triangle</p>

![The Matrix Triangle](/assets/img/triangle-the-matrix.png)

**Items:** Props play an important part in this story. The Matrix is an illustionary world that mimicks 1999 America urban life. The cars, skyscrapers, office, are illusions that contrast with the drearynes of reality that is a broken down cold Earth.

**Passions:** The Matrix is about liberating people from mentally safe place to accept a dreary reality because freedom is better than servitude. There's lots of emotions along this journey and hence the music of the story is filled with iconic music.

**Dialogue:** The dialogue of the matrix is filled with explanations about reality and power. Some of the best being "what is the Matrix", "wake up Neo", "I hate this place" and "do you think that's air your breathing now".

**Antagonist:** The matrix has guardians called Agent Smith. he leaders is hunt down troublemakers who reject subjugation. These are programs designed with near ultimate power to write the rules needed to keep people inside the matrix.

**Worldview:** Should humanity be free or be slaves to machines tricked into living inside a illusion that benefits the overseers. That is the worldview of the movie. In order to control the levers of power, the hero must master the rulebook of the matrix.

**Hero:** Morpheus, Trinity and their supporters are free from the matrix and can manipulate some of its rules. They however need someone with more power, and thus search for "the One". This is Thomas Anderson, who they liberate from the Matrix and teach to manipulate its rules. Neo is good controling the worldview of the Matrix he eventually defeats the antagonists. 

**Plot:** Each person is stuck in the matrix via a connection into their brain. But a person can't simply be unplugged physically without first being liberated mentality; which means to explain to a person why their mental reality is a fiction. There are thus lots of levers of power to struggle over from the guns, skills, and rules of the matrix, from the tools in reality too.

## Three Act Structure Graphs

As we learned in Mamet's class and his _Pig: The Movie_, every story is make believe. The question is how good will the fabrication be. The elements above, from props to plot, are what's needed to complete the illusion. Like a gourmet meal, once these incredients are properly balanced they all but disappear into a seemingly simple, but elegantly executed, creation.

Thus, every element must come together to a simple story. Star Wars is about a farm boy standing up to evil. Cinderella is about a women overcoming oppression. _The Matrix_ is about a man redefining his reality. _Pig: The Movie_ is about a father protecting his family. _Breaking Bad_ is about a good man descending into darkness.

You can see these stories in character names. Luke Skywalker rises above to fight darkness. Neo is the word for new because he's newly risen above his ignorance. Walter White appears to be a clean man. Sam Malone the consumate ladies man of _Cheers_, is always alone. The psychiatrist Frasier Crane always supports people in their lives. Even real life people can have poetic names, the con-artist Bernie Madoff, made off with his customer's money.

These character names also signify the problem of their respective stories. Will Luke overcome the empire? Will Neo survive the oppression of new ideas. Will Walter White keeping descending into darkness. Will Sam Malone ever find love?

We've already learned each story has three acts, here are some graph examples.

In a well told story the props, music, dialogue, characters, and plot blend seamlessly. The mark of success is the audience jumping, screaming, and laughter in their seats. All emotions they've commited because their minds are totally connected to the fake reality of a good story.

### Good Story

Not every story is well told. Many don't follow the rules Aristotle and Mamet teach. There are three possibilities for a story, functional or good, spectacle, and art.

<template v-if="gstri">
<p>Good Story Triangle</p>

![Good Story Triangle](/assets/img/triangle-story-functional.png)
</template>

<p>A good story is properly balanced between all the elements. As said above, Aristotle and Mamet would teach how to tell good stories by following this arrangement. Any story in any genre can be a good story from a space opera, to a young farm girls dream to marry a prince, to a story about a pig. Good stories are cheaper to write but harder to create. Yet when done correctly, good stories become immortal. The Illiad, Hamlet, Romeo and Julliette, Citizen Kane, and the Lord of the Rings are stories that will live with humanity forever.</p>

### Spectacle Story

<button class="t-btn" @click="ssgraph=true; sstri=false;">Graph</button>
<button class="t-btn" @click="ssgraph=false; sstri=true;">Triangle</button>

<template v-if="ssgraph">
<p>Spectacle Story Graph</p>

</template>

<template v-if="sstri">
<p>Spectacle Story Triangle</p>

![Spectacle Story Triangle](/assets/img/triangle-story-spectacle.png)
</template>

A spectacle story is imbalance of story components. The priority is given to props, effects, and loud music. Characters are rushing around too often to build up tension, reverse the situation, or experience setbacks. Movies today are increasingly spectacle. Hence, today we have ever more special effects, 3D movies, movie theater seats that shake, ever more sexual content, more horrific horror and so on.

Spectacle is how storytellers maintain interest when unable to tell a good story. This usually happens when trying to re-tell a story in a sequel or franchise. Because the problems, characters, and outcomes are pre-ordained in franchise, every reversal and realization of the plot is far less impact. In response, more spectacle is used to keep an audience interested.

Interest based on spectacle is short-lived. As spectacle requires more spectacle, eventually the audience can take no more and stops being distracted by the tricks. As Mamet says, spectacle is what people do when they can't write a good story. Spectacle is also very expensive to maintain and bankrupts anyone who uses it.

### Art Story

</template>

<template v-if="astri">
<p>Art Story Triangle</p>

![Art Story Triangle](/assets/img/triangle-story-art.png)
</template>

Art stories are skewed toward its characters. Good stories have a strong written plot that naturally becomes more important than any person. Art stories disregard plot and levers of power, instead focusing on talking about persons and their personalities.

Mamet called this the "Cult of Self". Art stories are like a person who thinks they are more interesting than they are. Instead of acting to achieve a goal, a character in a art story talks about their thoughts and ideas.

Art and spectacle stories rely on each other. As spectacle is used to maintain popular interest in a medium, art stories grow in direct proportion. That's because spectacle is boring to produce, thus creators start to over-indulge in art to compensate. Hollywood had a name for this co-dependency of spectacle and art as "one spectacle movie for the studio, one festival film for the actor".

Thus art stories let an actor to overact, or a director over direct the story. Like spectacle needs to increase itself with every iteration, the cult of self in art stories increases towards the bizarre that increasingly non-die hard fans find distasteful.

### Hero Triangle vs Antagonist Triangle

A story is character working hard to solve a problem. As mentioned already, stories are not debates with a Socrates like philosopher weighing all the options to decide a winner. Heroes act to take control levers of power from an antagonist. The antagonist is our enemy because she fights the hero who wants to solve a problem.

Antagonists have their own stories. We can visualize hero and villian stories by comparing their respective component triangles.

## Conclusions

Good stories are about problems. Therefore stories have a definite conclusion. Will farmer John sell his pig? Will the glass slipper fit Cinderella? Will the torpedo blow up the Death Star? Will Neo wake everyone up from the matrix?

Conclusions are great way to tell difference between functional, spectacle, and art stories. After the conclusion of a functional story, its characters return to a state of equality. Because the problem that started them on their journey is solved or not. Either way, their reality is changed. Whatever happens next is a new story, one in which the old main characters might not even be worth mentioning. Good stories therefore value equality and realism, because anyone can solve a problem and therefore everyone should be free to become a hero; even if they end up failing in their mission.

In comparison, spectacle has no problem to solve. Instead it's an effects show that only wants to return to another iteration in the sequel. The reality of a spectacle story hasn't changed much. Moreover, since the stars have to return in the sequel equality and realism are demoted in preference for the established cast.

Meanwhile, art stories have such a small problem they can have no proper conclusions. Since the hero isn't trying to change anything, theire reality was never in question, and thus the conclusion is hardly different that the starting point. Art stories favor selective equality because while the hero doesn't proclaim any speciali status as hero, they also think they are worthy of all the attention of a story.

## Story Sequels

People love good stories. Sometimes we like them so much we want to hear more from the characters. This happened when the Illiad of ancient Greece was followed by the Odessey and later the Aeneid. We have more recent examples such as The Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter books and movies. These classics managed to tell each successive story with the quality of the previous ones. However, it's more common for a sequel to be worse; like taking a picture of a picture, quality suffers with each successive version.

As already discussed, this is because telling a new story is much harder with baggage of an old one. There is a split personality in every sequel because it's hard to have a proper conclusion. A real conclusions is open to any possibility happening. But if the characters must live on the solve another similar problem to what they've just done, the once good story becomes predictable.

This is probably why Shakespeare never wrote a direct sequel, and why up until Godfather Part II in 1974, the movie industry never did either.

As already mentioned, with spectacle comes art. As the two increase with every iteration, there are good stories about people overcoming antagonists to solve real-life problems. Art/spectacle thus rotate in circles for as long as the audience will stay distracted.

## Historical Example

We've used Hollywood movies as an example of good, spectacle, and art stories. We can also use Hollywood's storytelling trends to display devolution from good to spectacle/art. Hollywood still makes some good stories, but those are increasingly not the norm.

Moroever, television shows also showcase the same phenomenon. Take successful shows like _Frasier_, _Seinfeld_, and _Friends_. Each started off with characters solving relatable problems like finding a better job, dating to find a spouse, and trying to pay the bills. However, their initial success means each character isn't allowed to grow. Instead, they must stay in the same apartment, keep the same job, and have the same friends. Without any new problems to overcome, nothing much changes for any character. As a result the stories become more spectacular and the characters eventually end up as charactertures of their orignal selves.

It's no surprise that he best episodes of the series are in the first half, and quality downgrades in later seasons. Actors lose their interest in their roles, and start working for the higher paycheck.

To demonstrate this phenomenon, gere is the rise of spectacle and art inside American movies over the last few decades.

## Summary

Here is a summary of all we learned. Stories are about a character working hard to overcome a problem. The problem drives the plot. The characters we follow, we follow because they are the most instrumental in solving or defending the one single problem of the story. Characters do not have debates. They fight over control of objects, that become levers of power because they are either causing a problem, or could solve it.

Stories have layers. In order of their importance they are, props, passions, dialogue, antagonist, worldview, hero, plot. When each of these are properly balanced they create a believable fiction.

If these story elements are not balanced correctly, there are two possibilities. Too much reliance on props, effects, and music, and a spectacle story is born. This story is so action packed characters are too busy solving instinctual problems like running from explosions for a story to have any meaning. On the other side, if there is too much reliance on characters and not problem solving, we get an art story where characters delve into their supposed interesting selves. As we learned with Mamet's class, art are created when creators are focused on the "cult of self" and not creating a story as audiences have always, and will always need.

As spectacle and art stories are told and re-told, they require ever more extreme versions to maintain interest. They are also co-dependent. People repulsed by art will gravitate to the spectacle, and vice versa. As each art and spectale become more extreme to maintain interest, one's disgust of the other extreme will maintain loyalty to their chosen extreme.

This drive to extremes excludes the reasonable middle ground of a characters working hard to overcome relatable real-life problems. Hence the moderate majority who just want to experience good stories are excluded.

Now that we understand storytelling, and the trends involved in functional, spectacle, and art, stories, let's get back to that Earthboat and understanding your story as Life struggles to evolve fast enough to stay afloat.
