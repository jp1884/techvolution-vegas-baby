Coming up a little later.


## Notes

- Conclusions are needed in evolution. This adaption either works or we try another. That's why some species are unchanged and some keep needing to adapt to a changing niche. Since our leaders are happy with their industrial age phenotypes, they antagonist evolution. Thus there's no conclusions to our daily lifes. Just more art and spectacle, hence the rising unhappiness. Conclusions to a good story make us happy.
