# On Directing Film

David Mamet

The book opens a quote from an Anthony Trollope novel He Knew He Was Right:

"They are most happy who have no story to tell".

## Preface ==

On Directing Film is based on a series of lectures Mamet gave for a Film Directing class at Columbia University in the fall of 1987. He had just finished directing his second film and felt he was somewhat knowledgeable on the subject, but still "not enough to realize the extent of my ignorance", and so he compensated for his lack of directing knowledge with his extensive writing experience.

Mamets says the key to both writing and directing is not to think of pretty visuals, but to imagine the logical steps in a story which only requires an imagination; which is why even a blind author could become a screenwriter. Too often directors ignore this, and rush to use pictorial images.

Instead of pretty images, Mamet says the job of the director is to understand what the story and its scenes mean and stage that in pictures. Movies should be the collection of clearly meaningful scenes instead of pretty visuals whose logical progression is hard to tie together into a story. The idea is summed up by a Hemingway quote "Write the story, take out all the good lines, and see if it still works."

Mamet emphasizes leaving out as much detail as possible. A good writer gets better only by learning to cut the ornamental, descriptive, narrative and especially the deeply personal. Mament agrees with Aristotle who says stories are about what happens to the hero fighting for what he wants, not what the writer thinks is interesting. Mamet doesn't always give example of "interesting" but given later examples he gives, it's anything from following the protagonist around or watching an actor over-act, neither of which is "the essential progression of incidents that occur to the hero in pursuit of his one goal.".

Mamet believes, and argues throughout the book, storytelling is a craft just like any other. It has natural rules to follow and thus master. While self-described artists claim any rules are a limitation to their expression, a true craftsman masters rules to give what their audience is looking for.

Hence, to make a good story, a writer or director doesn't need make pretty visuals, but only imagine a logical progression of incidents. "Screenwriting is craft based on logic. It consists of the assiduous application of several very basic questions: What does the hero want? What hinders him from getting it? What happens if he does not get it?." A writer's ego answers these questions in a logical progression to make a story. When done, he let's his id write the more artistic, and less important, dialogue.

The hand off between ego and id is analogous to a screenwriter giving a director a screenplay. The director's job is to present the story as the writer wrote it, and find simple visual shots to show the essential progression of incidents that happen to the hero while trying to get his own goal. Directing is thus the "joyful extension of screenwriter". Which is how Mamet says he taught his course and wrote this book.

## Chapter 1 ==

Titled storytelling, this chapter aims to explain Mamet's views on directing. Inline with his belief screenplays and directing are simply the essential progression of incidents of the hero pursuing his one goal, Mamet says the montage theory of directing developed by Sergei Eisenstein is the best way to direct a movie. He uses it to oppose how most American movies "[follow] the protagonist around", and try to figure out how to make scenes interesting, instead of finding a logical progression of incidents that is interesting.

Per Mamet, Eisenstein's montage method "is a succession of images juxtaposed so that the contrast between these images moves the story foward in the mind of the audience." Directing becomes a series of uninflected shots. A teacup. A fork. A door, and these uninflected shots tells a story.

Which is how natural storytellers tell stories; "'I'm standing on the corner. It's a foggy day. A bunch of people are running around crazy. Might have been the full moon. All of a sudden, a car comes up, and the guy next to me says...'". Juxtaposing images is also good filmmaking because it makes you wonder what is going to happen next. It's good to make the audience follow along. Let them be wait for each new event and be surprised as it happens.

Mamet compares montage theory to nature documentaries, where the action of a bird snapping a twig, then a deer raising it's head, tells the story of alertness, and implies impending danger. All inside two shots that by themselves are unrelated. In contrast, American filmmaking too often follows the deer or bird around in their day, instead of picking out the parts relevant to a story.

Mamet then calls most movie scripts garbage. Instead of telling a sequence of events that together makes a story, they tell narration like "Nick, a young fellow in his thirties with a flair for the unusual", which is an example of following a protagonist around. Descriptions are useless to any director because it's impossible to shot on set. People write these narrative scripts for movie executives, who Mamet emphasizes, can't read stories because it requires some cinematic education or humility to learn, "neither of which is going to be found in the studio executive".

When the script is written properly, the director's work is simply compiling a list of shots to represent the logical progression of incidents already imagined by the screenwriter. The director's work on set is nothing but sticking with the plan.

To emphasize his lack of trust in typical storytelling processes, Mamet says he suspects film schools are useless because he found drama schools to be useless because they "refrain from insulting the gentleman or gentlewoman student of liberal arts by offering instructions in a demonstrable skill", like writing logical stories, or assembling a shot list that creats a story in the mind of an audience. Instead, drama schools teach "things that will be learned by anyone in the normal course of events".

Mamet than blames technology, especially the SteadiCam, for enabling bad storytelling. Instead of doing the hard work and imagining a logical progression of incidents, filmmakers can use technology "because it makes it so easy to follow the protagonist around". Because of technology, directors think they can skip making a shot list, and use their self-proclaimed artistic genius to decide where to put the camera on set. This means they're left making the story in the editing room with the film avaiable. A process which is better done before shooting.

Mamet then turns philosophical. He explains when a writer ignore nature's rules of storytelling, they're likely to follow other people's opinions of high-class art (like performance artists do) or follow arbitrary rules to appease employers and get hired (like writing for ignorant studio executives). Writers will do this because they consciously want to please these groups and thus become risk-averse and use cliches.

The importance of following proper storytelling technique is to free the mind from these bad influences. Once the human mind follows nature's rules, it's "allowed true creativity", because their creation will be truly meaningful to an audience and stand the test of time.

Mamet says again storytelling is best told through uninflected shots. He notes that's also how dreams work and why they have so much power. Dreams are unrelated images that themselves have little meaning until their assembled together. It's the juxtaposition of images that gives dreams so much terror and beauty. Dreams aren't narrated, nor do they follow a person around for a day, dreams are simple series of shots that imply meaning which each shot doesn't have. Studying psychoanalysis, like The Interpretations of Dream, The Uses of Enchantment, and Memories, Dreams, Reflections, will help a filmmaker hone their craft and tell powerful stories.

The chapter ends by Mamet saying a film is a dream sequence. Platoon, is not any more or less realistic then Dumbo, both just tell a logical and surprising progression of incidents with uninflected shots. All stories are thus make-believe, the question is "how good make-believe is it going to be?"

## Chapter 2 ==

Titled "Where Do You Put the Camera?", this chapter is a dialogue with students from the Columbia University Film School about constructing a film. It puts Mamet's ideas into practice.

Mamet starts by asking the students to look around and create a scene about their situation; a teacher and his students inside a university classroom. A student replies they should put the camera above, to show the entire classroom and because it's a novel place to put the camera.

Mamet rejects the idea because the question was a trick. Asking "where to put the camera" is really asking what the scene is about. And asking what the scene means is really asking what does the protagonist want. You can't put the camera anywhere until you've written the scene with these details. Choosing a shot first is indulging on impulse, which is what performance artists do.

To get things going, Mamet decides the scene is about a student who wants to earn the instructor's respect.

Showing the progression of these incidents in a movie breaks down like this.

A beat/shot is the smallest unit of a movie.
Each beat has an objective.
A scene is a collection of beats.
Each scene has a super objective.
A movie is a collection of scenes about the character fighting to get what he wants.

Thus, only by understanding the superobjective of their scene, a student earning his instructor's respect, can the class think of good beats/shots for the scene. Finding the good beats automatically answers the question "where to put the camera" because the camera simply needs to shoot the require shot and move on.

At the start, Mamet repeatedly rejects student ideas that are too interesting, and encourages them to find the simplest shot to represent the objective and super-objective of the beat and scene respectively.

For example, Mamet rejects the idea of the professor having a prosthetic arm which falls off and the protagonist retrieves it to impress him. It tries too hard to be interesting, meaning it's too unusual for most the audience to relate to. Mamet turns this rejection into a wider rejection of a movie script trying to "establish the character". Referencing Aristotle, Mamet says character doesn't even exist in stories. The story's character is literally what the hero does in pursuit of their goal.

To Mamet, movie scripts should not establish a character with descriptions like "A fellow, trim, fit, obviously enamored of the good things in life...". A movie script should simply describe the images an audience sees on screen.

He explains by saying; "A fellow goes to a whorehouse, asks 'what can I get for five bucks', and the madam responds 'you should have been here yesterday, because...'. You don't care if this hero is trim, fit, and enamored of the good things in life. His action of going to a whorehouse with five bucks tells you everything you need to know about him. He could be anyone. Not giving him characterizations lets the audience put themselves in his shoes. Now the audience can imagine themselves, or someone they know, doing the same thing. Letting the audience enter into a stories reality is the magic of storytelling.

In short, simple characters make it easy to tell and listen to stories. Too many characterizations get in the way of a person's imagination.

Mamet tells his students to remove characterizations by using KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid). Repeatedly using KISS reminds writers to only find the meaning of beat and scene to tell the series of events of the protagonist trying to get what he wants. KISS withholds information overload, respects the audience, and keeps them guessing what's going to happen next; which is why they're watching the story in the first place.

Mamet continues by taking considering ideas for the "preparing for class" beat in the "impress the professor" scene. He explains why his student's initial ideas, showing labels and name tags, are too narrative, while or ideas like combing hair are too vague. When a student suggets writing on a notepad, Mamet likes it, especially when the he tells the students to withhold showing what the student is writting because it keeps the audience in suspense about what he's writing.

For the next beat, Mamet emphasizes the need to keep it logical. The superobjective is to gain the professor's respect. The first beat is to arrive to class early. The second is to prepare. And to get the third requires a logical beat to achieve the superobjective. The next beat is decided to be paying homage to the professor.

The class delves into the meaning of homage to find a shot that represents it. Mamet explains like a dream, the shot of homage, or any other beat, can be anything. The director isn't limited to what the protagonist is doing, but can represent the beat anyway the audience will understand it once it's juxtaposed with the other shots. In line with KISS, the class decides "walking feet", followed by "student stands up", most easily depicts homage.

To create the next beat, Mamet tells the class to stay on topic, by remembering the superobjective is "to the win the respect of the professor". After dismissing the students first ideas as too generic, he tells them to think of a fantasy life; what would the hero of the story do if unbound by contemporary social rules to gain the respect of his professor. Mamet says fantasy is good because audiences like stories different than a typical life.

To help the students think of the next beat, he tells them to create a material goal for the protagonist. Something tanglible to hold, have, and fight over. Thus, the student no longer simply wants the professor's respect, but wants the professor to change a grade. Giving "respect" a real-life manifestation into a school-paper makes the story easier to write and represent in shots. Either the professor changes the grade on the paper, or doesn't. Now the writer, and the audience, easily knows what the scene is about and when then scene is over.

Mamet then explains the notebook with the school-paper is a MacGuffin. A commonly used plot device, like a "secret briefcase", used to carry the action of a story. Simply knowing the protagonist needs the MacGuffin is good. The audience doesn't need to know why. It's better to leave out details about goals, because like with too much characterizations, leaving stuff out lets the audience think of themselves in the story. Everyone can cheer for a hero, but call the hero really tall, or really short, and now the audience relates less.

Mamet returns to making their "change a grade" scene. The next beat is getting a retraction from the professor. Using KISS again, the next beat should bes the student asking for a re-grade.

Now with a clear goal, the beats have more context. The hero is the student. The antagonist is the professor. The hero's superobjective is to get a new grade. The first beat is "Show up early/try door handle". Second beat is "to prepare/write in notebook". Third beat, "pay homage/rise when professor approaches", fourth beat is "plead case/hand over notebook".

With the scene partially constructed, Mamet asks the students about making props, partularly the student's notepad. He describes why it's not possible to make the notepad like a "retraction notebook", or a "prepared notepad". These are again characterizations unfit for a story. The notepad only needs to look like a average notepad a student would use in this situation. It's design should be recognizable as "the notepad" but call attention to itself as being weired or special. After all the notebook is now the empodiment of the scene and is more important then the protagonist. A director could only shoot shots of the notepad for this scene and still get the point across because the notepad is what the scene is about.

After some more work, the students and Mamet expand their shot list.

Showing up early: Student walks down hall, shot of a hand on a doorknob, student sits down on a bench.

Preparing: Student takes the notebook out, rips out a tab, writes something down on a tab, puts the tab in the plastic holder, closes the tab.

Paying homage: Student looking and getting up. Student runs to a glass door. He opens the door, professor walks through.

To present the case for re-grading: An empty desk. The notebook put on the desk. Professor sitting down looking at it.

The last beat is conclusion. What will the professor do? Mamet dismisses the idea the professor merely agrees re-consider the grade later, and instead says the professor should make judgement then and there because it has more dramatic weight. Mamet reminds his students the audience can be told of the fifth beat without following the protagonist around. The class decides the last beat as

Judgement: Shot of kids outside the classroom door. They look at each other. Student standing in the classroom with professor looking at him.

Resolution beat: Professor opens notebook. Opens desk drawer. Takes out stamp, and stamps the notebook. The student smiles, picks up the notebook, goes to his seat, and the professor calls kids waiting in the hallway to come into the classroom.

The chapter ends with a student asking Mamet what if the hero didn't get his new grade. To which Mamet responds "I don't know. It's our first movie. Let's make it a happy ending, what the hell. And now we're done, and that was excellent work". No unncessary characterizations, "interesting ideas", or pandering to an ignorant executive. A simple story about a common problem that anyone can relate to and thus enjoy.

## Chapter 3 ==

Titled, Countercultural Architecture and Dramatic Structure, this chapter serves to remind the reader of Mamet's main points.

Mament starts off by saying he attended a counter cultural college in the 1960's. A time when some people thought traditional architecture was too stifling. Unsuprisingly, counter cultural archecture proved to unliveable. It's buildings weren't designed with human habitation in mind, but from the architect's feelings and impulses. Mamet asserts these buildings either "fell down or are falling down or should be torn down".

Mamet contrasts counter-cultural buildings with his own. Built two hundred years ago by hand and with no nails, it will stand for another two hundred years because it was made by craftsman with respect for "wood, weather, and human domestic requirements".

This is the basic premise of the chapter, and indeed book. That just like archetecture, storytelling has a natural construction which is often and easily countered by a creator's impulses. Making anything has natural rules. It's the creator's job to master these natural rules and not suppose they're smarter than Nature.

Mamet says again, the purpose of a story is a hero who wants something, and the drama is finding out if she'll get it. That means every shot has to be a stepping stone in the journey. Signs, dubbed words, or anything supposedly "artistically interesting" is, like counter cultural buildings, not relevant. The only thing the audience cares about-and what the writer/director has to create-is finding out what happens next.

The job of the film director is thus to tell a story through the juxtaposition of uninflected images. Movies work like this, because human perception works to perceive two events, determine a progression, and want to know what happens next in the progression.

In contrast, performance art works like neurosis, which perceives events but appliess an overiding precondition. Like a person who assumes their ugly, and when people walk by them, assumes other people agree. The simple observation that the neurotic walked and ignored the other people too doesn't matter. Such is the unreasonable effect of a pre-condition.

That's why bad movies can still find an audience. They either share the neurosis of the artists "message" of being ugly or whatever other precondition the artist wants. Or, because the audience will work to find meaning, even if the writer and director didn't put any inside the story.

Like a craftsman, a smart writer/director masters human perception of uninflected images, and constructs a story with it, saving the audience from having to struggle to find meaning. Poor craftsmanship is why storytellers resort to being "interesting" or telling a neurotic message.

Mamet continues by saying a logical person building a building in Vermont uses slopped roofs, so the annual snow falls will easily slide off. However, many counter cultural buildings in Vermont have flat roofs and thus fall down. Similarly, Mamet says the American film industry is not following logical storytelling, and is caught in a spiral of degeneration. Because without logical storytelling, the writer/director has to resort to ever greater diversions, the end of which is obscenity. "Let's really see their genitals, let's really endanger the actor through stunts, let's really set the building on fire." Over a movie, this makes it more bizzare. Over a career, more outre. Over of a culture it brings on depravity".

In summary, the human conscious mind will always perceive a series of events. While the subconscious will always try to find meaning to a series of events. Thus, if the storyteller constructed a logical story, an audiences unconsicous and conscious minds are in alignment and the audience is perceiving the story just as the storyteller constructed it. This makes a magical link between the story and the viewer; and requires neither inducement in the form of spectacle, or explanation, in the form of the performance artist's narration of their self-importance.

Mamet ends the chapter by saying a story wants to be simply told through a series of uninflected images logically strung together to tell a story. He says it's very hard to do these very simple things. But "the mastery of them is the beginning of the mastery of the art of film".

## Chapter 4 ===

This chapter is titled "The Tasks of the Director - what to tell the actors and where to put the camera." It's a practical guide on what directors should do on a movie set.

This chapter starts by Mamet saying many directors don't keep it simple, and thus get stuck shoting too many takes because "they don't know what they want to take a picture of". If they were to follow KISS, and find the objective of the scene before going on set, they'd only need a few takes. For example, if a scene is to  'arrive early', then the director tells the actor "go to the door, try the door, and sit down. That is literally what you tell him. Nothing more."

Mamet here wants to help directors work with actors. Particularly if actors over-act and try to make the scene about them and not the objective. Over-acting ruins a movie by distracting the audience. The time to give meaning to a movie is writing the script. Nails, lumber, and shingles come together to make a house. Likewise, let the components of storytelling come together to tell a story. Writers, directors, and actors should stay on task and work together to make a story. When components keep it simple, you'll have a well constructed house and movie.

Old-time movies were good at keeping things simple. Actors were thus effective and memorable. Similarly, the director doesn't need to over think his directions. When the actor in the 'get a retraction scene' asks "how do I walk down the hallway?", the director can, because he's read the script and worked hard to create the shot list, listen to his subconcious that's already worked on that question, and say what he thinks "I don't know...quickly." That's how making a good movie can seem like luck, but is really the result of working hard on the shot list.

For whatever reason, usually lack of formal stage training, underemploymnet, and anxiety to advance their careers, contemporary actors too often resort to performance acting and try to 'emote', and 'discover', when their job is to simply act each beat as simply as possible. The contemporary director's job then is containing the contemporary impulses of actors.

Like acting, dialogue should be direct. Dialogue should not be spoken diaries. Nor should they talk about the plot. Dialogue is simple statements about what the character wants. Let the audience wonder why he wants what he does. When the director makes a good shot list, and tells the story with pictures, the dialogue is "sprinkles on the ice cream cone". Basically, a good movie still make sense if watched on mute.

Mamet now answers what a director should tell the crew, particularly when they repeatedly ask "where do I put the camera". Like with answering actors questions, this question is best answered by the subconscious. So it's best to put the camera "over there". Mamet admits he's a writer, and not a brilliant visual director, so he says he's telling the reader what he knows; which is to keep things simple, and shot the basic shot as per the shot list. Mamet reiterates again there is no such thing as a interesting angle. The movie should be interesting, not individual shots. Just keep things simple and shoot the shot.

Mamet's ideal movie set is like a photo shoot. Take a shot of the hall. Actoring walking down it. Trying the door knob. Sitting down. Nothing complicated. It's the string of shots that makes the movie good or not, not the location or angle of the camera. Cameras don't need fancy angles the same way actors don't need charactizations. A movie is simple a series of uninflected shots struck together to make a story.

Here mentions a Humphrey Bogart story. The legendary actor described how a famous scene in Casablanca was shot; the one where the French bar customers sing Le Marseillaise in the faces of their Nazi overlords. Even though the scene is so powerful, the director simply told Bogart to nod when asked if his bar could play the French national anthemn. Yet the scene as huge impact because it wasn't about Bogart's character, but about the French singing in defiance of the Nazi's. Today that actor would likely overact, draw attention to himself, and distract from the story. A good director would counter that impulse by doing his homework, make his shot list, and then put the camera in the simplest place to get the shot.

Lastly, Mamet says to the reader to learn these lessons and go make a movie. Either the reader will find someone who knows the steps, or will learn them himself. Mamet insists there's no mastery to moviemaking. No magic. Like playing the piano, anyone can learn. Some will be better than others, but anyone can learn. The components of moviemaking, like cinematography and sound mixing, are just technical skills, and "directing is just a technical skill. Make your shot list."

## CHAPTER 5

This chapter is review of the storytelling and directing rules already mentioned, and the displined application of them to construct a story called Pig-The Movie.

Before thinking of idea, Mamet starts off by reminding the reader to always ask "'why now?'", what happens if the idea is excluded. Knowing that's essential, let's the writer/director keep things simple and learn what to cut.

Mamet then says directors should study classic myths. He uses Dumbo as an example. Dumbo wants to overcome his large ears. He meets friends along the journey for a cure. In the end, his story turns out to be about self-discoverr, for Dumbo learns he can fly with his large ears, making him no worse, or better, than anyone else. Just different. Once Dumbo is okay with his ears, his problem is over, and so is the story.

Cartoons like Dumbo are a great reference for directors. Since there's no actors, directors don't have to contain artistic impulses. Better yet, since there's no cameras, the directors can unleash pure imagination when choosing their shot list. Cartoons, especially ones about classic myths and fairy tales, showcase the rewards to directors who keep things simple with stories that become immortal.

With all this in mind, Mamet says storytellers must know when to start their story. There must be an external event that causes a problem the protagonist wants to solve like "the plague on Thebes, the big ears, the death of Charles Foster Kane." Not starting a story on a major event, leaves dead air, which is usually filled with useless back story.

That's why fairy tales start with the perfect opening Once upon a time, there was a ... which kick starts the story write away. Characterizations are left out, and thus left up to the audiences imagination. The story starts, and ends, when the main characters rights their world and lives happily ever after.. How they do it is the fun part, not details about their personality.

With all these lessons in mind, Mamet now starts to create Pig The Movie with his students. The story is about "'Once there was a farmer who wanted to sell his pig.'" With a clear desire, the story has a natural beginning, middle, and end. It also has a long list of things not to include, like anything not about a farmer selling a pig.

A student recommends establishing the farm as the first shot. Mamet shoots that idea down and tells his students to start the story about a man selling his pig not talking about a farm. People will get that he's a farmer because he's trying to sell a pig. Let the audience wonder how he's going to sell it. The writer must first know why the man has to sell the pig, a question which also gives the class the story's beginning.

Mamet than changes the throughline to "'Once there was a farmer who had to sell his pig'". Making the farmer have to sell the pig makes it a stronger story. He advises the students that semantics are vital because words are like forks in the road, and being concise and purposeful is very important to be sure you're on the road you want to be on.

A student then recommends shots of the farmer posting "for sale" signs, to which Mamet says explaining a story is like a comedian explaining a joke. The audience may get why the joke would be funny, but they came to laugh, not understand. Likewise people watch stories to wonder what's going to happen next. Signs are explanations and not stories.

To find a better answer, Mamet reminds the students to find the story's reason. Why does the farmer have to sell his pigs? Don't concentrate on "he has too many pigs", or something else superficial, but ask what do pigs mean to him, and why does he have to sell it? Has he fallen on hard times, or maybe he had to leave his ancestral home. The more specific a writer is about the essence, the more he can find specific images to tell the story of a man who falls on hard times, which most people can relate to, versus a man who has to sell a pig, which most people can't.

Without finding the essence of the problem, the writer will not enter into the mind of the protagonist. Any story created will be superficial, like a stranger who tells you how to fix a problem you're having before learning anything about you.

Mamet then tries to find a reasonable reason why a farmer would need to sell a pig. It can't be out hunger, because why not kill the pig. It can't be a over due bank letter, because how's one pig going to help pay off a bank loan. But the search is vital because finding a good reason for having to sell the pig means the protagonist will have a reason to guide his actions, and the writer will have a good reason to start his story.

Mamets then jumps on the idea that the pig is a troublemaker and attacks the farmer's daughter; and that's why the farmer must sell it, and is the first scene that starts the story.

A student says the family should also be going hungry. To which Mamet replies a story shouldn't have two problems, because the protagonist can only want one thing.

Now the throughline is "Once upon a time a man had to sell a dangerous pig", which is a good development because being more precise helps create a more believable story.

After the pig attacks the farmer's daugter, the next shot is John the pig's owner, walking down the country road. He soon sees a prosperous man walking the other way. The story cuts to John about to sell the pig to the man. John is happy with the easy sale and a quick walk home. Then, the pig bites the buyer. The next shot is John walking down the road with the unsold troublemaker pig.

Continuing to filter student shot suggestions, the class settles on another man on the road. This one fixing his car. John wipes the pigs face and puts a hankerchief around it. Mamet says this is good because it uses a prop to show what the protagonist wants; to capitalize on his luck this time and sell his pig.

To help his chances even more, John helps the prospective buyer fix his broken cart. Afterwards, the two gentleman talk, the buyer picks up the pig, and puts it into his cart. The buyer reaches for his wallet, while the pig's face turns nasty again, and then... we see John walking down the road with his pig.

Mamet updates the throughline to be "once there was a farmer who tried everything he could to sell a dangerous pig."

What comes next. Lots of walking because John didn't capitalize and now has to walk to town in darkness, arriving at the slaughterhouse with a large pig pen.

The beat at the slaughter house becomes "end of a weary quest". The entrance is locked, and the farmer only sees a small office light on. Mamet again rejects ideas of putting up "slaughterhouse signs", because all that's important is John wanted to get here and there's a pig pen. A good story reveal events of a throughline and doesn't explain it.

Mamet is excited when a student suggests John should tie up the pig and go for a drink. At the bar, the farmer who the pig bit walks in and starts a fight. It's both logical and surprising, which Mamet likes. It gets even better when the pig breaks free and runs to fight side by side with John.

For the next beat, Mamet tells the students to stay away from adding more fights. It's too easy to repeat beats. Besides, the throughline is about getting rid of a dangerous pig, not fighting people.

Mamet then explains stories are a series of problem solving attempts. The first is the easiet, and as it fails, the protagonist tries harder and harder to solve his problem. Thus, Mamet adds a scene to the story's beginning, after the pig bites the John's daughter, where John tries setting it free in the woods, but the pig makes his way back, forcing him to try and sell it. This is what most people would try to do to get rid of the pig.

Now Mamet finishes the Pig-The Movie liks this.

John was sleeping at the slaughterhouse, and he wakes up and his pig is gone. Now not just a pig, but a friend who stood up for him. John doesn't care the slaughterhouse owner thought John was a sleeping drunk who stole the pigl John his buddy back. The two men fight and the next scene is a bloodied John walking back down the road with his pig.

Then the pig stops, and looks back at the slaughterhouse, and won't look away.

The next shot is John at the slaughterhouse paying the bruised owner some money. John then goes inside a pen and takes out a new pig.

The next shot is the two pigs are kissing at the farm. Then's there's many piglets. And John's daughter is riding the once dangerous pig's back. John looks around as if "what a pig".

The problem has been solved is a surprising way because the dangerous pig is now a happy pig. A logical, yet surprising, turn of events.

Mamet comments, that by staying loyal to KISS, creating the story was easier. Instead of trying to find interesting ways for everything, the class created reasons why someone would need to sell a pig. Since there are many good reasons, the story can be both reasonable and surprising, as well as relatedable to anyone dealing with a troublemaker.

In summary the objectives to each scene were:

A man tries to rid himself of danger, a man takes the easy solution to a difficult problem, a man tries to capitalize on a golden opportunity, a man comes to the end of a long quest, a man tries to regain possession, a man rewards a good deed.

The chapter ends with Mamet saying "Anybody with a [camera] can take a picture of a 'pig'". As long as they tell a story of the hero's persistence in a difficult world, and keep it simple with a logical series of uninflected shots, that are strung together to make a story.

## CONCLUSION ==

Mamet starts the last chapter by saying storytellers have a choice. Follow craft, or follow their impulses and join the "'Cult of Self' for a little while—the cult of how interesting you and your consciousness are".

Ship captains have the same choice when stearing through dangerous river waters. Of course captains "stick with the channel" because it's "marked", and so should directors.

Because among all the options a storyteller can choose, most are marked; "The river channel is the super-objective of the hero, and the marker buoys are the small objectives of each scene".

The director's toolkit is only the shot and the choice of shots is the only power a director has. No director "can't make it more interseting [in] the editing room". Nor can a director can't rely on actors making a boring story more interesting. Director's must follow craft, and not rely on God's invervention, or talent, to make up for not following the marked buoys and following craft.

Mamet insists there is a trade to screenwriting and a trade to directing. Both of which are very similar. Like any trade, anyone can learn it. If anyone tries hard enough the required type of "analytical thinking" will get easier. Directors must simply follow it, securing a throughline as a foothold, and moving on up the mountain, one step at a time will eventually get anyone to the top.

Knowing your craft, and applying it to your story, means you're subconscious will know many of the answers a director needs to know when working with editors, actors, and financiers. This is different from impulses of artists, but is mastery of a craftsman who knows where the buoys are.

Yet a storyteller can do everything right and still make a bad movie. Mamet says so what, that doesn't mean to avoid using craft in favour of impulses. He asks if a general is told by the gods he was going to lose tomorrow's battle, should he not still fight it with sound military tactics instead of trying to be interesting?

The only thing under anyone's control is craft; i.e. following the right philosophy. Good or bad, victory or defeat, is not under our control. All individuals can do is our job as best we can, and when done, go home. This is "exactly the same principle as the throughline. Understand your specific task, work until it's done, and then stop."

# DEFINITIONS

Throughout the book, Mamet defines several terms, many are referenced below.

The model story: "Remember that the model of the drama is the dirty joke. This joke begins: "A traveling salesman stops at a farmer's door"—it does not begin: "Who would think that the two most disparate occupations of agriculture and salesmanship would one day be indissolubly united in our oral literature? Agriculture, that most solitary of pursuits, engendering the qualities of self-reliance and reflection; and salesmanship, in which ..." Does the protagonist have to explain why he wants a retraction? To whom is he going to explain it? To the audience? Does that help him get it? No. He must only do those things that help him^et a retraction." pg 44.

Method acting: "This is what brings the actor to the play-not those gyrations of emotional self-abuse that hack teachers hove fobbled off as preparation." pg 44.

Directors: "The job of the film director is to tell the story through the juxtaposition of uninflected images —because that is the essential nature of the medium. It operates best through that juxtaposition, because that's the nature of human perception: to perceive two events, determine a progression, and want to know what happens next." pg 60.

Producers: "Those who style themselves 'producers' have not had the benefit of any such education (learning the craft of filmmaking), and their arrogance knows no bounds. They are like the white slave owners of old, sitting on their porches with their cooling drinks and going on about the inherent laziness of the Negro race. The 'producer,' having never had a run-in with the demands of a craft, sees all ideas as basically equal and his own as first among them, for no reason other than that he has thought of it. This notion is easier to fathom if one thinks back to the period of early adolescence and to, perhaps, the critique of an English teacher who said of our efforts: "I don't understand' or 'It is unclear,' of which correction one thought: 'The old fool. . . I know what I meant.'

I have a great deal of pride and, I suppose, a large admixture of arrogant pride. I, in my generally losing contest with these self-styled 'producers,' many times console myself by thinking that after society falls apart, I will be able to eke out at least my meals and shelter by putting on plays that may make people laugh; but that these 'producers' would have to wait until I and those like me went to work before they could eat.

Yes, that is how I see 'producers.' They are 'let me take that cow to the fair for you, son.'" pg 48-49.

The Modern American Movie Industry: "Interest in a film comes from this: the desire to find out what happens next. The less reality conforms to the neurotic's view, the more bizarre his explanation must become, the end of which development is psychosis—'performance art' or 'modem theater' or 'modem filmmaking.'" pg 63

"You cannot hide your objective. No one can hide. Contemporary American films are almost universally sloppy, trivial, and obscene. If your objective is to succeed in the 'industry,' your work, and your soul, will be exposed to these destructive influences. If you desperately crave acceptance by that industry, you will likely become those things." page 65

"It's a good thing that the people in Hollywood have no souls, so that they don't have to suffer through the lives they lead." pg 97.

How to Make Props: 
Mamet: "So, therefore, how does the book (prop) look?"
Student: "Make it recognizable."
Mamet: "Exactly so! Good! You've got to be able to recognize it." pg 50

Performance art: "'Performance art' works, as it's the nature of human perception to order random images in favor of an overriding preconception. Another example of this is neurosis. Neurosis is the ordering of unrelated events or ideas or images in favor of an overriding preconception." pg 60

"If you go up into Vermont and you build a roof with a peak, the snow will fall off. You build a flat roof, the roof will fall down from the weight of the snow—which is what happened to a lot of the countercultural architecture of the 1960s. 'There may be a reason people have wanted to hear stories for ten million years,' the performance artist says, 'but I really don't care, because I have something to say'." pg.65

Acting: "The acting should be a performance of the simple physical action. Period. Go to the door, try the door, sit down. He doesn't have to walk down the hall respectfully. This is the greatest lesson anyone can ever teach you about acting. Perform the physical motions called for by the script as simply as possible. Do not 'help the play along.'" pg 68.

Dialogue: "The purpose of dialogue is not to carry information about the 'character.' The only reason people speak is to get what they want. In film or on the street, people who describe themselves to you are lying. Here is the difference: In the bad film, the fellow says, "hello, Jack, I'm coming over to your home this evening because I need to get the money you borrowed from me.' In the good film, he says, "where the hell were you yesterday?'" pg 71.

Writing characters: "The reason we identify is that the writer left out the narration. We only saw the story. We can identify with the pursuit of a goal. It's much easier to identify with that than with ''character traits.'Most movies are written, 'he's the wacky kind of guy who ...' But then we can't identify with that person. We don't see ourselves in him because we aren't being shown his struggle but instead are shown those idiosyncrasies that divide us from him. His "knowledge of karate,' his wacky habit of yodeling to call his dogs, his peculiar partiality to antique cars . . . how interesting.'" (pg 97).

Narration: "It doesn't matter that all your cinematographers and assistant directors and producers are pleading with you to show more of the farm. You'll say to them, "why? It's not a movie about a farm. You want to see a movie about a farm? Great. You know? Go see a travelogue. Go look at a map. This is a movie about a man who has to rid his house of danger. Let's make this movie. The audience knows what a farm looks like or they don't. That's their lookout. Let's respect their privacy.'" page 90

Talent: "If you're correct in the small things, the smallest of which in this case is the choice of a single uninflected shot, then you will be correct in the larger things. And then your film will be as correct and as ordered and as well-intentioned as you are. It can never be more so, but it can be less so if you desire to manipulate the material, or hope that God wall intervene and save you, which is what most people mean when they talk about 'talent.'" page 104
