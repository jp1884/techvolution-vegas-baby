# On Directing Film

David Mamet

The book opens with a quote from the Anthony Trollope novel _He Knew He Was Right_:

"They are most happy who have no story to tell".

## Preface ==

Mamet starts _On Directing Film_ by saying its based on a series of film directing lectures he gave at Columbia University in the fall of 1987. He had only just finished directing his second film and felt he was "like the pilot with two hundred hours of flying time, I was the most dangerous thing around". So when writing this book on direting, he compensated for his lack of directing knowledge with his extensive writing experience.

Throughout the preface and book, Mamet says the key to both screenwriting and directing is to imagine the logical steps in a story. That what a writer's job is, for a good writer "gets better only by learning to cut, to remove the ornamental, the descriptive, the narrative, and especially the deeply felt and meaningful. What remains? The story remains. What is the story? The story is the essential progression of incidents that occur to the hero in pursuit of his one goal." Too often directors ignore this and rush to use distracting pictorial images instead.

Instead of pretty images, Mamet says the job of the director is to understand what the story and its scenes mean, and stage it. Movies should be the collection of clearly meaningful scenes instead of pretty visuals whose logical progression is hard to tie together into a story. The idea is summed up by a Hemingway quote "Write the story, take out all the good lines, and see if it still works."

Mamet emphasizes leaving out as much detail as possible. Mament agrees with Aristotle who says stories are about what happens to the hero fighting for what he wants, not what the writer thinks is interesting. Here, Mamet doesn't give an example of "interesting" but given later examples it's anything from needless scenery shots, wordy dialogue, over-acting, backstory, and directors following the protagonist around. Basically anything that isn't "the essential progression of incidents that occur to the hero in pursuit of his one goal".

Mamet believes, and argues throughout the book, storytelling is a craft just like building a house. It has natural rules to follow and thus master. While self-described artists claim any rules are a limitation to their suppossedly "interesting" self-expression, a true craftsman masters rules to give what their audience is looking for.

Hence, to make a good story a writer or director doesn't need make pretty visuals, but only imagine a logical progression of incidents. "Screenwriting is craft based on logic. It consists of the assiduous application of several very basic questions: What does the hero want? What hinders him from getting it? What happens if he does not get it?." A writer's ego answers these questions in a logical progression to make a story. When done, he let's his id write the more artistic, and less important, dialogue.

The hand off between ego and id is analogous to a screenwriter giving a director a screenplay. The director's job is to present the story as the writer wrote it, and find simple visual shots to show it. Directing is thus the "joyful extension of screenwriter". Which is how Mamet says he taught his course and wrote this book.

## Chapter 1 ==

Titled _Storytelling_, in this chapter Mamet explains his views on film directing, with a strong emphasis on that screenplays and directing are only tools to tell a story. Mamet says the montage theory of directing, developed by Sergei Eisenstein, is the best way to direct a movie because it focuses on storytelling. He uses it to oppose how most American movies "[follow] the protagonist around", and try to figure out how to make scenes interesting, instead of finding a logical progression of incidents that is interesting.

Per Mamet, Eisenstein's montage method "is a succession of images juxtaposed so that the contrast between these images moves the story foward in the mind of the audience." Directing becomes a series of uninflected shots. A teacup, a fork, a door; which tie together to tell a story.

Mamet notes this is how natural storytellers tell stories; "I'm standing on the corner. It's a foggy day. A bunch of people are running around crazy. Might have been the full moon. All of a sudden, a car comes up, and the guy next to me says...". Juxtaposition implies something's coming next, but leaves the audience in suspense to find out what. It's good to make the audience wonder Mamet says. Let them be wait for each new event and be surprised as it happens.

Mamet compares montage theory to Nature documentaries; where the action of a bird snapping a twig, then a deer raising it's head, tells the story of alertness, and implies impending danger inside two shots that by themselves are unrelated. In contrast, American filmmaking too often follows the (main character) deer or bird around, instead of picking out the parts of their day relevant to a story.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_documentary

Mamet then calls most movie scripts garbage. Instead of telling a sequence of events that together makes a story, they tell narration like "Nick, a young fellow in his thirties with a flair for the unusual". Such descriptions are useless to any director because it's impossible to shot on set. People write these narrative scripts for movie executives, who Mamet emphasizes, can't read stories because it requires some cinematic education or humility to learn, "neither of which is going to be found in the studio executive" page 4.

When the screenwriter does their job, and writes the logical progression of incidents of a story, the director's work is to simply compile a list of shots [storyboard] to represent the events already imagined by the screenwriter. The director's work on set is nothing but sticking with this plan.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storyboard

To emphasize his lack of trust in formal storytelling education, Mamet says he suspects film schools are useless because he found drama schools to be useless. Drama schools he says "refrain from insulting the gentleman or gentlewoman student of liberal arts by offering instructions in a demonstrable skill", like writing good stories. Instead, drama schools teach "things that will be learned by anyone in the normal course of events" page 5.

Mamet then blames technology, especially the SteadiCam, for enabling bad storytelling. Instead of doing the hard work and imagining a logical progression of incidents and making a shot list, filmmakers can use easy technology "because it makes it so easy to follow the protagonist around". Because of technology, directors use their self-proclaimed artistic genius to decide where to put the camera after arriving on set. This means they're left making the story in the editing room with the film avaiable. A process which is better done before shooting.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steadicam

Mamet then turns philosophical. He explains when a writer ignores Nature's rules of storytelling, they're likely to follow other people's opinions of high-class art (like performance artists do) or follow arbitrary rules to appease employers and get hired (like writing for ignorant studio executives). Writers will do this because they consciously want to please these groups and thus become risk-averse and use cliches.

The importance of following proper storytelling technique is to free the mind from these bad influences. Once the human mind follows Nature's rules, it's "allowed true creativity", because their creation will be truly meaningful to an audience and stand the test of time.

Mamet says stories with uninflected shots are natural, which is why dreams have so much power. Dreams are unrelated images that themselves have little meaning. It's the juxtaposition of images that gives dreams terror and beauty. Dreams aren't narrated, nor do they follow a person around for a day. Dreams are a series of shots that imply meaning. Thus, studying psychoanalysis, like _The Interpretations of Dream, The Uses of Enchantment,_ and _Memories, Dreams, Reflections_, will help a filmmaker hone their craft and tell powerful stories.

The chapter ends by Mamet saying a film is a dream sequence. _Platoon_, is not any more or less realistic then _Dumbo,_ both just tell a logical and surprising progression of incidents with uninflected shots. All stories are thus make-believe, the question Mamet asks is "how good make-believe is it going to be?"

## Chapter 2 ==

Titled _Where Do You Put the Camera?_, this chapter is a dialogue with Mamet and his students. Together they put Mamet's ideas to practice and construct a movie scene.

Mamet starts by asking the students to look around and create a scene about their situation; a teacher and his students inside a university classroom. A student jumps in with an idea that they should start the scene by putting the camera high above the classrom, to show the entire class and because it's an interesting angle.

Mamet rejects the idea outright because the question was a trick. Asking "where to put the camera" is really asking what the scene is about. And asking what the scene means is really asking what the protagonist wants. Thus, you can't put the camera anywhere until you've written a scene with these details. Choosing a shot first is indulging on impulse, which is what performance artists do.

To get things going, Mamet decides the scene is about a student who wants to earn the instructor's respect. But before he proceeds to create the scene, Mamet describes how all movies break down:

- A movie is a collection of scenes about the character fighting to get what he wants.
- Each scene has a super-objective, and is a composed of a series of beats.
- Each beat has an objective, and is represented by a shot of film.

Thus, only by understanding the super-objective of their scene can a filmmaker think of good beats/shots for the scene. Also, creating good beats automatically answers the question "where to put the camera" because the camera simply needs to shoot the pre-selected beat.

Now the class starts brainstorming super-objective ideas for their _earn the instructor's respect_ scene. Mamet repeatedly rejects the first ideas because they're too interesting. Instead he encourages the class to find the simplest shot to represent the objective and super-objective of the beat and scene respectively.

For example, Mamet rejects the idea of the professor having a prosthetic arm that falls off so the hero can pick it up for him. This idea tries too hard to be interesting, meaning it's too unusual for most the audience to relate to. Mamet turns this rejection into a wider rejection of a movie script trying to "establish the character". Referencing Aristotle, Mamet says character doesn't even exist in stories. The story's character is literally what the hero does in the story, not who they were before the story started.

To Mamet, movie scripts should not establish a character with descriptions like "A fellow, trim, fit, obviously enamored of the good things in life..."(page 13). A movie script should simply tell the heroes story in images.

He explains by saying; "A fellow goes to a whorehouse, asks 'what can I get for five bucks', and the madam responds 'you should have been here yesterday, because..." (page 13). You don't care if this hero is trim, fit, and enamored of the good things in life. His action of going to a whorehouse with five bucks tells you everything you need to know about him. Not giving him characterizations lets the audience imagine him to be themselves or someone they know. This is how audiences enter into a stories reality and is thus the magic of storytelling.

In short, simple characters make it easy to tell and listen to stories. Too many characterizations get in the way of writing stories and make them less relatable.

Mamet tells his students to remove characterizations by using KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid). Using KISS reminds writers to only find the meaning of each beat and scene. KISS prevents information overload from interfering with the audiences' understanding the story.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle

Mamet then returns to making a scene about a student impressing his professor. The first beat is decided to be a _arriving early to class_. The class now needs a shot to show it. He explains why his student's initial ideas like the hero walking down an empty street at sunrise as too vague, and the hero nervously looking at his watch as too interesting. When a student says "A shot of the man coming down a hall. A shot of a door, he tries it, it's locked, it doesn't open. He sits down? That's it."(page 21) With the class, Mamet analyzses if these shots represent _arriviing early to class_ and decides that it does.

When some students ask if they can add more to the scene like a janitor mopping the floor, Mamet tells them always cut out unneccessary information. They already have shots to describe the objective of the _arrive early_ beat, and there's no need to add more then absolutely required.

For the next beat, Mamet emphasizes the need to keep it logical and keep the superobjective _to gain the professor's respect_ in mind. If the first beat is to _arrive to class early_. The second must be _prepare for class_. Mamet says the student's first ideas of "brushing up on the professors methodology" as too vague, and ideas like "reading the professors book" as too narrative. When a student suggests "writing on a notebook", Mamet likes it, especially when he tells the students to withhold showing what the student is writting because it keeps the audience in suspense.

After discussing what's the logical step, the next beat is decided to be _paying homage to the professor_.

The class delves into the meaning of homage to find a shot that represents it. Mamet explains like a dream, the shot of homage, or any other beat, can be anything. The director isn't limited to what the protagonist is doing, but can represent the beat anyway the audience will understand it once it's juxtaposed with the other shots. The class decides _walking feet_ followed by _student stands up_ depicts homage and Mamet agrees.

To create the next beat, Mamet reminds the class to keep the superobjective in mind. After dismissing the students ideas, like show affection and bragging, as too generic, he tells them to think of a fantasy life; what would the hero of the story do if unbound by contemporary social rules to gain the respect of his professor. Fantasy is good because audiences like stories different than a typical life.

To help the students think of the next beat, he tells them to create a material goal for the protagonist. Something tanglible to hold, have, and fight over. Thus, the class says their hero no longer simply wants the professor's respect. Instead the student wants the professor to change a grade of a term paper. Giving "respect" a real-life manifestation into a term-paper makes the story easier to write, act, and represent in shots because either the professor changes the grade on the paper, or doesn't. Now the writer, and the audience, easily knows what the scene is about and when then scene is over.

Mamet then explains the notebook with the term-paper is a MacGuffin; a commonly used plot device, like a "secret briefcase", used to carry the action of a story. Simply knowing the protagonist needs the MacGuffin is good. The audience doesn't need to know why. It's better to leave out details about goals, because like with too much characterizations, leaving stuff out lets the audience think of themselves in the story. Everyone can cheer for a hero, but call the hero really tall, or really short, and now the audience relates less.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin

Mamet returns to writing the scene with his students. The latest beat was _paying homage_ to the professor. Using KISS again, the next beat should be the student _asking for a re-grade_.

Mamet summarizes the work down so far. Note how because the term-paper makes the hero's goal a physical object, each beat is easier to understand. The hero is the student. The antagonist is the professor. The hero's superobjective is to get a new grade. The MacGuffin is the notebook with the term-paper inside it. The beats breakdown as:

1. show up early/try door handle.
2. prepare/write in notebook.
3. pay homage/rise when professor approaches.
4. plead case/hand over notebook.

With the scene partially constructed, Mamet asks the students about making props, partularly the student's notebook. He rejects ideas to make the loko like a "regrading notebook", or a "prepared notebook". These are again characterizations unfit for a story. The notebook only needs be regular notebook with just enough distinction to be recognizable as _our_ notebook. Recognition is vital because our notebook is now the empodiment of the scene and is therefore more important than the protagonist. A director could only shoot shots of the notebook and still get the scene's point across.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatrical_property

With all the above in mind, and after some more work, the students and Mamet expand their shot list as follows:

1. _Showing up early_: Student walks down hall, shot of a hand on a doorknob, student sits down on a bench.
2. _Preparing for class_: Student takes the notebook out, rips out a tab, writes something down on a tab, puts the tab in the plastic holder, closes the tab.
3. _Paying homage to the professor_: Student looking and getting up. Student runs to a classroom door. He opens the door, professor walks through.
4. _Present the case for re-grading_: An empty desk. Professor sits down. The notebook is put on the desk. Professor grabs it, and looks at the notebook.

The last beat is the conclusion. What will the professor do? Mamet dismisses the idea the professor decides to "think about it". Instead, the professor should make judgement then and there because its more dramatic. Mamet reminds his students the audience can be told of the next beat without focusing on the protagonist. The class decides the last beats are.

5. _Professor giving his judgement_: Shot of kids outside the classroom door. They look at each other. Hero/student standing in the classroom with professor looking at him.
6. _Conclusion_: Professor opens notebook. Opens desk drawer. Takes out stamp, and stamps the notebook. The student smiles, picks up the notebook, goes to his seat, and the professor calls the waiting kids into the classroom.

The chapter ends with a student asking Mamet what if the hero didn't get his new grade. To which Mamet responds "I don't know. It's our first movie. Let's make it a happy ending, what the hell. And now we're done, and that was excellent work".

By which Mamet means they made a story with no unnecessary characterizations, "interesting ideas", or pandering to an ignorant executive. A simple scene about a common problem that anyone can relate to and thus enjoy.

## Chapter 3 ==

Titled, _Countercultural Architecture and Dramatic Structure_, Mamet in this chapter expands main points about writing and directing stories.

Mament starts off by saying he attended a counter cultural college in the 1960's. A time when some people thought traditional architecture was too stifling. Unsuprisingly, counter cultural archecture proved to be unliveable. It's buildings were not designed with human habitation in mind, but from the architect's feelings and impulses. Mamet asserts these buildings either "fell down or are falling down or should be torn down".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterculture

Mamet contrasts counter-cultural buildings with his own. Built two hundred years ago by hand and with no nails, he says it'll stand for another two hundred years because it was made by craftsman with respect for "wood, weather, and human domestic requirements".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpentry

This is the basic premise of the chapter, and indeed book. That just like architecture, storytelling has a natural construction which is often countered by a person's impulses. However making anything has natural rules a person should learn and master. When building a roof a person should "understand a little bit about the effects of gravity and the effects of precipitation". It's person's job to master these natural rules and not suppose they're impulses are more important.

Mamet says again, a story is a hero who wants something and the drama is finding out if she'll get it. That means every shot has to be a stepping stone in the journey. Signs, dubbed words, or anything supposedly "artistically interesting" is, like counter cultural buildings, unnatural. The only thing the audience cares about-and what the writer/director has to create-is a story about a person rising to the occasion and fighting to get what she wants.

As for any other motives Mamet says their impossible to achieve with drama; "the nature of the dramatic art [is to] to tell a story. That's all it's good for. People have tried for centuries to use drama to change people's lives, to influence, to comment, to express themselves. It doesn't work. It might be nice if it worked for those things, but it doesn't. The only thing the dramatic form is good for is telling a story." (page 64-65)

The job of the film director is thus to tell a story through the juxtaposition of uninflected images. Movies work like this, because human perception works to perceive two events, determine a progression, and want to know what happens next in the progression.

In contrast, performance art works like neurosis, which perceives events but applies an overiding precondition. Like a person who assumes their ugly, and when people walk by them, knows other people agree. The simple observation that the neurotic ignored the other people too doesn't matter. Such is the unreasonable effect of a pre-condition.

That's why bad movies can still find an audience. The audience either shares the neurosis of the artists "message" of being ugly or whatever other precondition the artist indulged. Or, because the audience will work to find meaning in a movie, even if the writer and director didn't put any inside the story.

The audience's has a strong desire to find a story in every series of incidents. This is why good a writer/director should masters human perception of uninflected images and constructs a story with it; saving the audience from having to struggle to find meaning. Poor craftsmanship forces storytellers to try to be "interesting" or tell a neurotic message.

Mamet continues by saying a logical person building a structure in Vermont uses slopped roofs so the annual snow falls will slide off. However, many counter cultural buildings in Vermont have flat roofs and thus fall down. Similarly, Mamet says the American film industry is not following logical storytelling, and is caught in a spiral of degeneration. Because without logical storytelling, the writer/director has to resort to ever greater diversions, the end of which is obscenity. "Let's really see their genitals, let's really endanger the actor through stunts, let's really set the building on fire. Over a movie, this makes it more bizzare. Over a career, more outre. Over of a culture it brings on depravity" (page 65).

In summary, the human conscious mind will always perceive a series of events. While the subconscious will always try to find meaning to a series of events. Thus, if the storyteller constructed a logical story, an audiences unconsicous and conscious minds are in alignment and the audience is perceiving the story just as the storyteller constructed it. This makes a magical link between the story and the viewer; and requires neither inducement in the form of spectacle, or explanation in the form of the performance artist's narration about their self-importance.

Mamet ends the chapter by saying a story wants to be simply told through a series of uninflected images logically strung together to tell a story. He says it's very hard to do these very simple things. But "the mastery of them is the beginning of the mastery of the art of film" (page 66).

## Chapter 4 ===

This chapter is titled "The Tasks of the Director - what to tell the actors and where to put the camera". It's a practical guide on what directors should do on a movie set.

This chapter starts by Mamet saying many directors don't keep it simple and write proper movie scripts, make a good shot list, and thus get stuck shooting too many takes because "they don't know what they want to take a picture of". If they were to follow KISS, and find the objective of the scene before going on set, they'd only need a few takes. For example, if a scene is to _arrive early_, the director should tell the actor "go to the door, try the door, and sit down. That is literally what you tell him. Nothing more." (page 68)

Mamet here wants to help directors work with actors; particularly if actors over-act and try to make the scene about them and not the objective. Over-acting ruins a movie by distracting the audience. For example, Nails, lumber, and shingles come together to make a house. A craftsman would never use lumber for a roof, or shingles for a frame. Likewise, writers, directors, and actors should do their job and work together to make a story. When components keep it simple, you'll have a well constructed house and movie.

Old-time movies were good at keeping things simple. Actors were thus effective and memorable. Similarly, the director doesn't need to over think his directions. When the actor in the _get a retraction_ scene asks "how do I walk down the hallway?", the director can, because he's read the script and worked hard to create the shot list, listen to his subconcious that's already worked on that question, and say what he thinks "I don't know...quickly." That's how making a good movie can seem like luck and "talent", but is really the result of working hard on the script and the shot list.

For whatever reason, usually lack of formal theatre stage training, underemploymnet, and anxiety to advance their careers, contemporary actors too often resort to performance acting and try to "emote", and "discover", when their job is to simply act each beat as simply as possible. The contemporary director's job is thus containing the impulses of actors.

Like acting, dialogue should be direct and simple. Dialogue should not be spoken diaries of a character's idosyncratic thoughts. Nor should they talk about the plot. Dialogue is simple statements about what the character wants. Let the audience wonder why he wants what he does. When the director makes a good shot list, and tells the story with pictures, the dialogue is "sprinkles on the ice cream cone". Basically, a good movie still make sense if watched on mute.

Mamet now answers what a director should tell the crew. Particularly when they-repeatedly-ask "where do I put the camera". Like with answering actors questions, this question is best answered by the subconscious whose thought about the script and shot list in great detail. Thus the answer is usually a well justified "over there". Mamet again openly admits he's a writer, and not a brilliant visual director, so he says he's telling the reader what he knows; which is to keep things simple, and shot the basic shot as per the shot list. Mamet reiterates again there is no such thing as a interesting angle. The movie should be interesting, not individual shots.

Mamet's ideal movie set is like a photo shoot. Which he showcases with these shots:

1. Shot of a hallway.
2. Actoring walking down it.
3. Trying the door knob.
4. Sitting down.

Just simple shots. It's the string of shots that makes the movie good or not, not the location or angle of the camera. Cameras don't need fancy angles the same way actors don't need charactizations.

Here Mamet tells a Humphrey Bogart story when the legendary actor described how a famous scene in _Casablanca_ was shot; the one where his French customers sing France's national anthem in the faces of their Nazi overlords. Even though the scene is so powerful, the director only told Bogart to nod when asked if his bar could play the anthemn. _The scene_ has huge impact because Bogart didn't overact. The scene was about the French singing in defiance of the Nazi's, not about Bogart's character who was simply "required to nod, he nodded. There you have it. The audience is terribly moved by his simple restraint in an emotional situation—and this is the essence of good theater"(page 76).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_(film)

In contrast, "Contemporary playwriting, filmmaking, and acting tend to offer us the reverse—people performing mundane and predictable actions in an overblown way." A good director should counter that trend by doing his homework, make his shot list, tell the actor to keep it simple, and then put the camera in the simplest place to get the shot.

Mamet says to the reader to learn these lessons and go make a movie. Either the reader will find someone who knows the steps, or will learn them himself. Mamet insists there's no mastery to moviemaking. No genius required. Like playing the piano, anyone can learn. Some will be better than others, but anyone can learn. The components of moviemaking, like cinematography and sound mixing, are just technical skills, and "directing is just a technical skill. Make your shot list." (page 77)

## CHAPTER 5

This chapter uses Mamet's rules for writing and directing to make a story called _Pig-The Movie_.

Mamet says the first step is to create a movies throughline. But before thinking of any throughline ideas he tells his students to always think "why now?", why does your idea for a story force a person to leave their typical day and personality, and challenge themselves to rise to the occasion and overcome a new found problem. Knowing the specific event that forces someone to step-up let's the writer/director keep things simple and learn what to cut when writing their story.

Mamet then says directors should study classic myths and uses _Dumbo_ as an example. Dumbo is a story about a elephant in the circus who wants to overcome his large ears. He meets friends along his journey for a cure. In the end, his story turns out to be about self-discovery, for Dumbo learns he can fly with his large ears, making him no worse, or better, than anyone else. Just different. Once Dumbo is okay with his ears, his problem is over, and so is the story.

Once the story is over, the protagoinst is free to return to being whatever personality he wants. These are the unhindered character traits performance artists think are so interesting, but aren't worth watching a movie about. Only if Dumbo rises to face down another problem will we hear a story about Dumbo again.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumbo

Cartoons like _Dumbo_ are a great reference for directors. Since there's no actors; directors don't have to contain artistic impulses. Better yet, since there's no cameras, the directors have to do a shot list, and can unleash pure imagination when choosing it. Cartoons, especially ones about classic myths and fairy tales, showcase the rewards to directors who keep things simple. That's why only classic stories ever become immortal.

With all this in mind, Mamet tells his students to think about "why now?" again. Storytellers must know the answer when starting their story. There must be an external event that causes a problem the protagonist wants to solve like "the plague on Thebes, the big ears, the death of Charles Foster Kane." Not starting a story on a major event, leaves dead air, which is usually filled with useless back story.

That's why fairy tales start with the perfect opening "Once upon a time, there was a..." because this kick starts the story right away. Characterizations and backstory are left out, and thus left up to the audiences imagination. The story starts when the people challenge their world; and ends, when the main characters right their world (or not). How they do it is the fun part, not details about their pre-story personality.

With all these lessons in mind, Mamet now starts to create _Pig The Movie_ with his students. Mamet starts them off with by saying the story is about "Once there was a farmer who wanted to sell his pig." (page 82) With a clear desire, the story has a natural beginning, middle, and end. It also has a long list of things not to include; anything not about a farmer selling a pig.

A student recommends establishing the farm as the first shot. Mamet shoots that idea down outright. Like when asking "where to put the camera" the writer must first understand his story before deciding on any shots. Thus, finding out why the man has to sell the pig is their current job.

Mamet than changes the throughline to _Once there was a farmer who had to sell his pig_. Making the farmer _have_ to sell the pig makes it a stronger story. He advises the students that semantics are vital because words are like forks in the road, and being concise and purposeful is very important to be sure you're on the road you want to be on.

A student then recommends shots of the farmer posting "for sale" signs, to which Mamet says explaining a story is like a comedian explaining a joke. After the explanation the comic's audience may get why the joke would be funny, but they came to laugh, not understand. Likewise people watch stories to wonder what's going to happen next. Since signs are explanations and not stories, they should be avoided.

To find a better answer, Mamet reminds the students to find the story's reason. Why does the farmer have to sell his pig? He says don't think of reasons like "he has too many pigs" because that's superficial. Instead ask what do pigs mean to him, and why does he have to sell it? Reasons are relatable, because most of an audience won't own pigs, but they have their own comparable things.

Thus, writers should search for their stories deeper meaning. Like maybe the man has fallen on hard times, or maybe he had to leave his ancestral home. The more a writer uncovers the story's essence, the more he can find specific images to tell the story of a man who falls on hard times, which is a story most people can relate to, versus a man who wants get rid of a pig, which most people can't.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl

Without finding the essence of the problem, the writer will not enter into the mind of the protagonist. Any story created will be superficial, like a stranger who tells you how to fix a problem you're having before learning anything about you.

Mamet then tries to find a good reason why a farmer would need to sell a pig. It can't be out hunger, because why not kill the pig. It can't be a over due bank letter, because how's one pig going to help pay off a bank loan. But the search is vital because finding a good reason for having to sell the pig means the protagonist will have a reason for his actions and the writer will have a good reason to start his story.

As student's give their ideas Mamets jumps on the idea that the pig is a troublemaker and attack's the farmer's daughter, the class does too, and everyone agrees to use it as the reason for their main characters selling his pig.

A student says the family should also be going hungry. To which Mamet replies a story shouldn't have two problems, because the protagonist can only want one thing.

Now the throughline becomes _Once upon a time a man had to sell a dangerous pig_, which is an improvement because the language is more precise and thus helps create a more believable story.

The class creates the first shots for the story thusly:

1. Pig attacks the farmer's daugter.
2. The pig's owner (John) walking down the country road with the pig.
3. John soon sees a prosperous man walking the other way.
4. John about to sell the pig to the prosperous man.
5. John is happy with the easy sale and the quick walk back home.
6. The pig bites the prosperous man.
7. John walking down the road again with the unsold troublemaker pig.

Continuing to filter student shot suggestions, the class settles on John coming across another man on the road; this one is fixing his car. After seeing the new potential buyer, John wipes the pigs face and puts a hankerchief around it. Mamet says this is good because it uses a prop to show what the protagonist wants; to capitalize on his luck and sell his pig.

To help his chances even more, John helps the prospective buyer fix his broken cart. Afterwards, the two gentleman talk, and soon the buyer picks up the pig, and puts it into his cart. As the buyer reaches for his wallet, the pig's face turns nasty, and then... we see John walking down the road with his troublemaker pig.

Happy with the work they've done so far, Mamet updates the throughline to be _once there was a farmer who tried everything he could to sell a dangerous pig_.

The class then discusses what should come next. They decide on lots of walking, well into the night which is good because it emphasizes John's punishment for not selling his pig. Farmer John ends up arriving at the slaughterhouse, that has a large pig pen, in the dead of night.

The beat at the slaughterhouse becomes _end of a weary quest_. The entrance is locked, and the farmer only sees a small office light on. Mamet again rejects ideas of putting up "slaughterhouse signs", because all that's important is John wanted to get here and there's a pig pen. A good story reveals logical events and doesn't explain them.

Mamet is excited when a student suggests John should tie up the pig and go for a drink. And when John's at the bar, the man with the broken cart--who the pig bite--walks in and immediately starts a fight with John. Mamet loves the idea because it could happen, so it's both logical and surprising. It gets even better when a students says the pig breaks free and runs to fight side by side with John!

For the next beat, Mamet tells the students to stay away from adding more fights. It's too easy to repeat good beats. Besides, the throughline is about getting rid of a dangerous pig, not fighting people. It was a great idea, don't diminish it by repeating it Mamet says.

Mamet then explains stories are a series of problem solving attempts. The first are the easiet, and as they fail, the protagonist tries harder and harder solutions to solve his problem. With this in mind Mamet adds a scene after the pig bites John's daughter. He says a logical person would have tried setting the pig free in the woods, so in this movie John tried that first. Of course the troublemaker pig made his way back, forcing John to try and sell it.

To wrap the lectur up Mamet finishes the _Pig-The Movie_ like this.

After the fight John returns to the slaughterhouse. He wakes up in the morning and his pig is gone. John is angry, because now the pig isn't just a pig, but a friend who stood up for him. The slaughterhouse owner says he took the pig because he thought John was a drunk who stole it, and thus dismisses John's demand for the pig to be returned. John fights the slaughterhouse owner to get his buddy back. The next scene is a bloodied John walking back down the road with his pig.

Then the pig stops, and looks back at the slaughterhouse and won't look away.

The next shot is John at the slaughterhouse paying the bruised owner lots of money. John then goes inside a pen and takes out a new pig.

The next shot is the two pigs kissing at the farm. The next shot is many piglets playing. And John's daughter now riding the once dangerous pig's back. John looks around as if "what a pig". And that ends the story of _Pig-The Movie_.

Mamet says the story is good because the dangerous pig is gone. He's now a happy pig. A logical, yet surprising, turn of events.

Mamet comments, once the class created good reasons why someone would need to sell a pig, creating the story was easier than trying to find interesting ways for everything. Since there are many good reasons, the story can be both reasonable and surprising, as well as relatedable to anyone dealing with a troublemaker.

In summary the objectives to each scene were:

1. A man tries to rid himself of danger.
2. A man tries the easy solution to a difficult problem.
3. A man tries to capitalize on a golden opportunity.
4. A man comes to the end of a long quest.
5. A man tries to regain possession
6. A man rewards a good deed.

The chapter ends with Mamet saying "Anybody with a [camera] can make a movie of a 'pig'". As long as they tell a story of the hero's persistence in a difficult world, and keep it simple with a logical series of uninflected shots strung together to make a story.

## CONCLUSION ==

Mamet starts the final chapter by saying every storyteller has a choice. Follow craft, or follow their impulses and join the "'Cult of Self'... the cult of how interesting you and your consciousness are" (page 106).

Ship captains have the same choice when stearing through dangerous river waters. Of course captains "stick with the channel" because it's marked by buoys. And so should directors.

Because among all the options a storyteller can choose, most are marked; "The river channel is the super-objective of the hero, and the marker buoys are the small objectives of each scene".

The director's toolkit is only the shot. The choice of shots is the only power a director has; they "can't make it more interesting [in] the editing room" (page 104). Nor can a director rely on actors over-acting to make a boring story better. Director's must follow craft, and not rely on God's invervention, or supposed talent, to make up for not following the marked buoys.

Mamet insists there is a trade to screenwriting and a trade to directing. Both of which are very similar. Like any trade, anyone can learn it. If anyone tries hard enough the required type of "analytical thinking" will get easier. Directors must simply follow it, securing a throughline as a foothold, and moving on up the mountain; one step at a time will eventually get anyone to the top.

Knowing your craft, and applying it to your story, means you're subconscious will know many of the answers a director needs to know when working with editors, actors, and financiers. This is different from impulses of artists, but is mastery of a craftsman who knows where the buoys are.

Yet when asked if a a storyteller can do everything right and still make a bad movie Mamet says yes, but that doesn't mean to avoid using craft in favour of impulses. He asks if a general were to be told by the gods he was going to lose a coming battle, should he not still fight it with sound military tactics instead of trying to be interesting?

The only thing under anyone's control is craft; i.e. following the right philosophy of Nature. Good or bad outcomes is not under our control. All individuals can do is our job as best we can, and when done, go home. Which is Mamet explains is "exactly the same principle as the throughline. Understand your specific task, work until it's done, and then stop." (page 107)

# DEFINITIONS

Throughout the book, Mamet gives his definition or explanation of several commonly terms. Some are referenced below.

The model story: "Remember that the model of the drama is the dirty joke. This joke begins: 'A traveling salesman stops at a farmer's door'—it does not begin: 'Who would think that the two most disparate occupations of agriculture and salesmanship would one day be indissolubly united in our oral literature? Agriculture, that most solitary of pursuits, engendering the qualities of self-reliance and reflection; and salesmanship, in which ...'" (page  44).

Method acting: "This is what brings the actor to the play-not those gyrations of emotional self-abuse that hack teachers hove fobbled off as preparation." (page  44).

Directors: "The job of the film director is to tell the story through the juxtaposition of uninflected images —because that is the essential Nature of the medium. It operates best through that juxtaposition, because that's the Nature of human perception: to perceive two events, determine a progression, and want to know what happens next." (page  60).

Producers: "Those who style themselves 'producers' have not had the benefit of any such education (learning the craft of filmmaking), and their arrogance knows no bounds. They are like the white slave owners of old, sitting on their porches with their cooling drinks and going on about the inherent laziness of the Negro race. The 'producer,' having never had a run-in with the demands of a craft, sees all ideas as basically equal and his own as first among them, for no reason other than that he has thought of it. This notion is easier to fathom if one thinks back to the period of early adolescence and to, perhaps, the critique of an English teacher who said of our efforts: "I don't understand' or 'It is unclear,' of which correction one thought: 'The old fool. . . I know what I meant.'

I have a great deal of pride and, I suppose, a large admixture of arrogant pride. I, in my generally losing contest with these self-styled 'producers,' many times console myself by thinking that after society falls apart, I will be able to eke out at least my meals and shelter by putting on plays that may make people laugh; but that these 'producers' would have to wait until I and those like me went to work before they could eat.

Yes, that is how I see 'producers.' They are 'let me take that cow to the fair for you, son.'" (page  48-49).

The Modern American Movie Industry: "Interest in a film comes from this: the desire to find out what happens next. The less reality conforms to the neurotic's view, the more bizarre his explanation must become, the end of which development is psychosis—'performance art' or 'modem theater' or 'modem filmmaking.'" (page 63).

"You cannot hide your objective. No one can hide. Contemporary American films are almost universally sloppy, trivial, and obscene. If your objective is to succeed in the 'industry,' your work, and your soul, will be exposed to these destructive influences. If you desperately crave acceptance by that industry, you will likely become those things." (page 65)

"It's a good thing that the people in Hollywood have no souls, so that they don't have to suffer through the lives they lead." (page  97).

Making Props:
Mamet: "So, therefore, how does the book (prop) look?"
Student: "Make it recognizable."
Mamet: "Exactly so! Good! You've got to be able to recognize it." (page  50)

Performance art: "'Performance art' (only) works, (because) it's the Nature of human perception to order random images in favor of an overriding preconception. Another example of this is neurosis. Neurosis is the ordering of unrelated events or ideas or images in favor of an overriding preconception." (page  60)

"If you go up into Vermont and you build a roof with a peak, the snow will fall off. You build a flat roof, the roof will fall down from the weight of the snow—which is what happened to a lot of the countercultural architecture of the 1960s. 'There may be a reason people have wanted to hear stories for ten million years,' the performance artist says, 'but I really don't care, because I have something to say'." (page 65)

Acting: "acting should be a performance of the simple physical action. Period. Go to the door, try the door, sit down. He doesn't have to walk down the hall respectfully. This is the greatest lesson anyone can ever teach you about acting. Perform the physical motions called for by the script as simply as possible. Do not 'help the play along.'" (page  68).

Dialogue: "The purpose of dialogue is not to carry information about the 'character.' The only reason people speak is to get what they want. In film or on the street, people who describe themselves to you are lying. Here is the difference: In the bad film, the fellow says, "hello, Jack, I'm coming over to your home this evening because I need to get the money you borrowed from me.' In the good film, he says, "where the hell were you yesterday?'" (page  71).

Writing characters: "The reason we identify is that the writer left out the narration. We only saw the story. We can identify with the pursuit of a goal. It's much easier to identify with that than with ''character traits.'Most movies are written, 'he's the wacky kind of guy who ...' But then we can't identify with that person. We don't see ourselves in him because we aren't being shown his struggle but instead are shown those idiosyncrasies that divide us from him. His 'knowledge of karate,' his wacky habit of yodeling to call his dogs, his peculiar partiality to antique cars . . . how interesting.'" ((page  97).

Narration: "It doesn't matter that all your cinematographers and assistant directors and producers are pleading with you to show more of the farm. You'll say to them, "why? It's not a movie about a farm. You want to see a movie about a farm? Great. You know? Go see a travelogue. Go look at a map. This is a movie about a man who has to rid his house of danger. Let's make this movie. The audience knows what a farm looks like or they don't. That's their lookout. Let's respect their privacy.'" (page 90)

Talent: "If you're correct in the small things, the smallest of which in this case is the choice of a single uninflected shot, then you will be correct in the larger things. And then your film will be as correct and as ordered and as well-intentioned as you are. It can never be more so, but it can be less so if you desire to manipulate the material, or hope that God wall intervene and save you, which is what most people mean when they talk about 'talent.'" (page 104)

Editing: "We said that the scene is the correct unit of study. If you understand the scene, you understand the play or movie. When the problem posited by the scene is over, the scene is over. A lot of times in movies you want to get out of the scene before the problem is over and have it answered in the next scene, as a matter of fact. Why? So that the audience will follow you. They, you will remember, want to know what happens next." (page 64)

What drama is good for: "To get into the scene late and to get out early is to demonstrate respect for your audience. It's very easy to manipulate an audience—to be 'better' than the audience—because you've got all the cards. 'I don't have to tell you anything; I can change the story in midstream! I can be whatever I want. Go to hell!' But listen to the difference between the way people talk about films by Werner Herzog and the way they talk about films by Frank Capra, for example. One of them may or may not understand something or other, but the other understands what it is to tell a story, and he wants to tell a story, which is the nature of the dramatic art—to tell a story. That's all it's good for. People have tried for centuries to use drama to change people's lives, to influence, to comment, to express themselves. It doesn't work. It might be nice if it worked for those things, but it doesn't. The only thing the dramatic form is good for is telling a story." (page 64-65)

# How to See the Matrix

<!-- added to end of Mamet -->It would seem creating a story means one is also in a story as well, whether our real-life story is good or bad, depends on the tools at hand, the problems on the frontline, and ruling philosophy in power.

Let's start by reading some of On Directing Film straight from Mamet. We'll talk about what this means to real-life afterwards. Just keep note what a writer has to discard and keep, to create a worthy product.

"There was a newspaper review lately of a book about the career of a novelist who went to Hollywood and tried to succeed at writing screenplays. He was deluded, the reviewer said, in this pursuit—how could he have hoped to succeed as a screenwriter when he was nearly blind!

The reviewer exhibited a profound ignorance of the craft of screenwriting. One does not have to be able to see to write films; one has to be able to imagine.

There is a wonderful book called _The Profession of the Stage Director_, by Georgi Tovstonogov, who writes that a director may fall into one of the deepest pits by rushing immediately to visual or pictorial solutions.

This statement influenced and aided me greatly in my career as a stage director; and, subsequently, in my work as a screenwriter. If one understands _what the scene means_, and stages that, Mr. Tovstonogov was saying, one will be doing one's job for both the author and the viewer. If one rushes, first, into a pretty, or pictorial, or even descriptive staging, one may be hard-pressed to integrate that staging into the logical progression of the play. And, fiirther, while so hard-pressed, and while working to include the pretty picture, one will undoubtedly become wedded to its eventual inclusion, to the detriment of the piece as a whole.

This concept was also stated by Hemingway as, "Write the story, take out all the good lines, and see if it still works."

My experience as a director, and as a dramatist, is this: the piece is moving in proportion to how much the author can leave out.

A good writer gets better only by learning to _cut_, to remove the ornamental, the descriptive, the narrative, and _especially _the deeply felt and meaningful. What remains? The story remains. What is the story? The story is the _essential progression ojincidents_ that occur to the hero in pursuit of his one goal.

The point, as Aristotle told us, is what happens to the hero . . . not what happens to the writer.

One does not have to be able to see to write such a story. One has to be able to think."

This process of learning to leave out the deeply personal, heartfelt, to learn to cut to the problem and solution a person is applying to that problem is a microcosm of the story of life. Life does the same thing via evolution. It gives lifeforms many variations, and through the story of life, see which ones need to be cut out/naturally selected, to continue the story.

And human life is the same. Every confict, failure, war, invasion, invention, discovery, revolution, is humanity cutting to the essential progression of incidents.

The art and spectacle of life, the corporate meetings, aristocractic lifestyles, palaces, banquets and balls, all that bullshit, is like a single story, what life is cutting out via conflict.

Life is a writer. And it writes with its lifeforms. Here's how it plays out for humanity. Seeing this truth, means seeing behind the stage and looking into how the magic happens.
