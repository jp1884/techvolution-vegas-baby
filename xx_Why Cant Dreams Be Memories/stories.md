## Candy Cane

I've got this great story about some friends stealing a monkey from a zoo. They saw a commercial with a cute little monkey-and being high as weed can make you-conceived a surprisingly ingenious plan to get a new pet.

It work too. They actually got the primate. But, and this is a big blue butt, they stole a 70 pound baboon instead. And then that monkey's family-being as mad as abduction can make you-conceived their own unsurprisingly vicious plan to enact revenge.

I've never met a person who didn't laugh at the idiots who stole a baboon from a zoo. It's one of the stories I've got that always makes someone happy.

We all love being happy don't we. Young and old, girl and boy, even cats and dogs, every living thing loves to be happy. I bet trees even smile when the sun shines. And nothing makes us happier than a funny story. Aren't parties just a place we exchange or make new memories?

To have any happiness, we need someone out there to take the chance, to make the memory for the rest of us to enjoy.

Yet, we don't talk about our sad stories. There are no parties where people talk about their sad stories. Although the world is dark and full of terrors. Black holes, solar flares, hunger, disease, there's a million things to make us sad.

You have painful stories. You must. Each of us does. But when do we ever tell them? Never, or if not never, pretty much never. Maybe we've paid a therapist to listen, or we're lucky enough to trust someone to share our sorrows. I've met a few angels in my life who actually listened instead of waiting for their turn to speak.

But that kind of therapy is rare. We hate pain so much we just don't want to hear it, sometimes even from our loved ones.

So if we almost never share them, why don't we forget the sad stories? Why do we remember the pain? Why do sad memories even exist!

Because we don't get to chose what stays in our brains. Life designed us, and designed us for a reason. We seek out happiness, but we learn from pain.

And so our brains store the worst pains right next to the brightest happiness. Life screwed us. We're drawn to happiness like a moth to light, but we learn the most from pain of getting zapped.

Your, mine, every life since forever, is nothing but a collection of happy and sad stories. Happy and sad ones. Of first loves, forgotten friends, and the times you just wanted another try.

I'm sad I'll never hear your stories. I'm sure you've got some great "monkey" stories of your own. I'm not going to tell you that one now. Because since I have you here, I'm going to tell you a better one.

This story will give you memories; delightfully happy ones and tear jerking, crying on the pages sad ones. You'll love the upsides and learn a lot from the down.

I'm going to tell you a story about two kids visiting a Emergency Room. I'm going to tell you a story about the one who never left.

---

Big glass entry door open. A pair of perfectly white sneakers walk in. Snow on the sneakers is kicked off and a pair of hands wipe the snow off of jeans and a bulky winter jacket. Now a young face, around 10 maybe 12, looks around a Emergency Room.

Each chair is filled with a sick person, or someone sick with worry.



Back to those white shoes. A nurse asks the kid, "Hi, can you say where does it hurt...". The young boy is listening to the nurse, but steals another look at the waiting room and one lady.

She's thirtish, with baggy eyes ruffled clothes. She totally ignored the ideals of fashion. At a corporate job she's be sent home for breaking the rules. But no one can make her leave here, because she holds her child. The little girl is so wrapped in her mother's arms, bundled up so much and held so tight we can't even see the tike.

Care for a sick kid and you'd look and be doing the same thing as this poor mother. Or maybe this mother is so cranked out on opioids she's beat her child pretending it was another baseball accidents requiring more painkillers; or from an addicts vantage point "lifegivers" might be a better name.

Viruses, diseases, bacteria are evil bastards. But so are human greed, deception and addiction. And that brings us make to our ongoing story filled with happy and sad twists and turns. A regular person sitting across from another can't know what form of evil the other chair is suffering from.

She does. At least she gets close the charge nurse does. The person so in charge they put in right in her name. She screens everyone who comes in and tells them where to go and who to see. This place is filled with stories, and for a few minutes she's director of everyone's life.

And now she's just about done talking to the kid with the shinny white snow covered shoes; Marky. He's mpw sucking on a candy cane, he points to his tummy with his own loving mother stands behind him. The nurse says "thank you Marky, please take a sit and we'll call you when ready."

Marky says his thank you, gets up and says to his Mom "there's a lot of people, let's sit over by that mom...". Marky looks around.

There's only a few empty chairs spattered around.

Marky still sucks on his candy. He puckers his lips and starts to walk. He zigs and zags and skips over some feet and into a seat. His mother is forced to sit a row away. She doesn't mind, taking out her cross word puzzle. She does take a look at Marky, who is already talking to his neighbor, the mother we already met, the one clutching her kid.

Marky looks at her, and takes in the image. He sees what anyone would see. A very stressed mother holding her kid in a ER waiting room.

"A loving mom is such a nice image. Like a movie poster. Even in this place. I'm sure everything will be fine."

The mother turns. "Thank you."

Marky continues. "I've got a stomach ache. I was at my mother's Christmas party and I snuck in a drink of eggnog and wow... Candy canes soothe the pain for some reason. But my mom said I had to come here."

Just now, Marky stomach cramps and his fist grips in response to the pain. Jennifer eyes widen.

Marky smirks, takes a second and crunches down on the last bit of candy, "Time for another. Does your daughter want one?". The sick kid, a girl of five or six, lifts her head. Marky smacks his hands together and looks at the mother's hand, which is now holding the candy cane; one so beautiful it looks like it was made by Santa's best pastry chef.

"Magic.", says the boy. "I was performing at the party. I can't wait to get back out there. I wanted to ask you, when I walked in I said you might know this question. Do you think mountains, places, hospitals, have memories? Can they remember happy and sad?"

The angst in the question distracts the mother. For the first time in hours she thinks about something else other then her pain.

"I suppose they do. I know I'm adding some memories right now."

"I'm sure they'll be happy ones."

The charge nurse yells out, "Jessica, Jessica please come with me." The mother rises with her daughter.

"Good luck. God Bless." says a smiling Marky. "Thank you, you too" Jessica says as she walks away. "Let's go Samantha, it's our turn. Remember what we talked about". The toddler is distracted, happily taking in at her new candy.

Marky watches the mother and daughter go with the nurse. It's a heartfelt image, one fit for a photograph, and once that makes Marky say with disdain. "Addict."

Marky opens up another candy. A middle age man looks at the artistic treat, and Marky asks, "How are you feeling tonight?".

"Sprained my ankle."

"If hospitals have memories, I don't think it'll remember that one."

---

Although the any Emergency Room is a place of a thousand memories lived during countless stories, this ER isn't moving at the pace of a hit TV show. Most of the chairs in the waiting room are empty. No one is talking to the triage nurse.

Marky is chatting with one of the few people left. They're talking about their favorite Netflix shows. Marky runs through a list like streaming veteran, each of with the other guy share their favorite scenes, shows and actors.

Eventually Marky name is called.

He gets up, and goes with the nurse. There's been a shift rotation. The nurse  is different now.

"Let's go Mark."

"Marky"

"Oh sorry. Let's go Marky. Who are you here with?"

"My mom. She just went to feed the meter."

"Okay, we'll we can get started. How are you feeling tonight?"

"Feel okay. Waiting to hear what you think though. Yourself?"

"It's been a long night."

A walking cane leaning against the wall. It's a festive one and looks like a candy cane, just like one of the artistic treats Marky has been using.

Marky grabs it. He grips the handle, and starts to walks like his right leg is suddenly useless.

"Lots of sprained ankles out there."

"Lots of everything out there." The nurse says before nothing "I hope you don't really need that. Do you know whose that is?". Marky is chewing on the candy again and so takes a second to respond, "Oh, I saw the guy who left it behind. I'll put in the lost and found when I get out of here."

Nurse says "Such a good guy. Well let's go inside that room and we'll see what's wrong."

The two walk past a room with the mother Jessica and her kid. The little five year old is sitting in the bed in a gown with an electrode wire attached to her arm.

Marky stops and stares at the image. In a world filled with good and bad, the image of a mother with her sick kid is one that can embody both love and despair in a single frame. A black hole sun. A memory to last a lifetime that anyone would hope has a happy ending.

Mark pulls out another candy cane. This one is a real beauty, flashes of red, green, bits of blue tinsel. And the top it off is a crown of gold. One fit for a princess.

Marky leaves the piece of art on the window sill. The mother is living the sadness and doesn't notice, but the daughter does. The earlier gift lifted her spirits and now this one inspires a smile.

The nurse says "Let's go Marky."

Marky continues on. The memories of happy or sad living it's way in the minds of the mother, daughter, before this memories lodges itself inside the mind of a person, to creates a person with it's memories of happy and sad, and now it includes both, because Marky and his gifts of candy gave a kid a glimmer of hope during a time of despair.

- banter
- he delays
- talks about a canker sore
- he meets Tyler who jokes with him

Marky walks into the examination room. "Please close the door and we'll see what's wrong with your...tummy is it?" Marky nods and closes the door.

"Okay take off your shirt please."

"Do I have to?"

"Um, well if your tummy hurts I have to see it".

"I'd rather not, but you need to?"

"Yeah, I know it's a bit cool, but I hopefully won't be long." Marky looks around. He doesn't want to, but is too nice to make it an issue. He gives up and takes off jacket. Then his sweater. This is thinner sweater.

Marky keeps talking his layers. "Wow, someone doesn't like the cold." Marky stops at turtle neck, and goes to sit on the bed. "Everything, please Marky." She goes to table to grab a pair of latex gloves. She's putting them on and puts on her stethoscope, and turns around.

She sees Marky shirtless. A image that reveals his story, a story of a kid of 10 or 12 that was very much hidden under layers. Layers meant to protect from the pain of winter hide the pain of kid living with pain.

"Marky...." mumbles the nurse. She takes in the new image, the new memory and this one will stay in her story forever.

He's frail, skinny and malnourished. There are burns across his chest. Cigar sized. There's even a needle mark on his arm. This is beside the huge scar in his side. The nurse hopes to herself it's from a surgery.

"Where is your mother?" asks the sorrowful nurse, said with pain in her voice that tells us how much the memory is sinking in. "I never know how to answer that one." replies Marky. "But my tummy does hurt."

Marky gets up on the bed and lies down. The nurse goes over, and starts her examination. She places the stethoscope all over the chest, heart, and lungs.

- imply the mother wanted Marky to gain meds, but left. That's the House story for this chapter, that's only true in Marky's origin story he's reliving.

First examination....
- ends with Marky being diagnosed with some serious stuff, while Jennifer walks out with a cold. Mixing extremes, and the theme, of happy and sad. Remember it ends with a poster image of the mother/life Marky never had.

White laminate floor tiles go on and on. Until wheels spin over top them at a breakneck pace. The bangs of heavy medical equipment sound out. White running shoes and hospital gowns hustling along the rubberized hallway.

A man is pushing the heavy medical equipment as a nurse runs beside him. "Every week has one. Does it Tyler" she says to him.

As the equipment nears her room, Jessica the mother gets up and rushes to the door. And here enters the hidden evil of this iconic image. The mother of a sick kid is scared, and all she wants is for this medical contraption, whatever it's heavenly purpose is born to defeat an evil she never wants to see. As the nurses rush faster towards Jessica she stands and comes to the window.

But the gang of healers pass by the stay at home mom, rush into the room next door. Jessica the loving mother puts her hands to mouth in a genuine gesture whose intent she'll never admit. Jessica then sees the candy cane. She walks a bit out her door and sees the image, and makes another memory.

Marky is on the bed, filled with wires that make him look like an experiment. The contrast between this room and the sick girl is large. Marky really upped the intensity. Happy and sad may be at odds, but that doesn't mean there aren't levels to each almost as big as they are too each other.

As the medical staff are saying their beeps and bops, Marky is on the raised bed. He's looking at each staff, following their motions like he's watching a merry go round.

Jessica can't look away. She's startled, scared, yet fascinated. This is a memory in the making. The thing the loving mother feared would happen to her daughter is happening to this boy, this stranger. She would hate herself for thinking it consciously, but she doesn't, because her subconscious is demanding to find out what happens next.

She's watching a story she'll never forget.

And this boy, this young spunk of a kid, is sitting there calm and gentle. "Why is he holding a giant candy cane?" she blurts to herself. The object is so out of place you or you (or I) would think the same thing.

But then another weird thing happens. Marky looks over at her, makes eye contact, and mouths to the mother "Playing helps." He holds his cane up just a bit to show his new friend how pretty it is.

Mark puts his hands up, waving at the orchestra of medical professions. They slow and slow and slow until he has the floor, he whimpers "What am I suppose to be feeling?"

For a second, just a second the healers orchestra stare. The image of a boy holding a giant candy cane burns into the mother's memory.

Dr. Blue asks "Are you feeling something new Mark?... Is the pain somewhere outside your stomach."

"I can't take a full breath." Dr. Cameron grabs her stethoscope, puts it on skinny chest, and listens. The young doctors eyes enlarge and her lips pucker. She looks at Dr. Blue, who responds "we need a CT scan now."

"It's not operating at this time." She returns to Mark "Are you sure your mother only went to check the car parking?"

"Yeah"

"We're going to need to run a lot of tests okay. We'll tell your mom all about them, but we can go ahead right now okay?"

"If you think it's best. What are you thinking?"

"That you're a brave young man, and we're going to make you all better."

"That sounds like a good idea". Dr. Cameron nod her head in sympathy, she's looks at the nurses and is thinking to herself the odds of a single person, never mind a kid, being so sick.

"Should I keep going?"

"What else are you feeling."

"Something, but it's what I'm not feeling that's starting to freak me out."

Marky sits up in the bed. So before we run tests, I'd like to hear your ideas for a diagnosis for. Seems prudent. Let's see who can get the sick kid his diagnosis."

The medical staff freezes.

"Don't just stand there like a bunch of kids waiting to talk to Santa. It's time to get to work, you know diagnostics." So frozen are the staff, they don't even object when Marky removes several diodes. He gets up and walks around, using his cane because his right leg is now useless.

"You there Dr. Cameron and Dr. Blue, and you, who are you?"

"Tyler"

"And what's your role?"

"My role?"

"Um yeah, what do you do here? Anthensia, cardiology, NP"

"I delivery medicines on the weekends."

"A red cavalier among a park of Mercedes" snorts Marky. "Okay, Blue, Cameron, what do you think is wrong. Let's get it all out on the table"

"I'll answer any question." says Mark. Dr. Blue asks Jennifer the mother "Are you the mother". Jennifer promptly waves her head no.

"She's not. Come on. Sometimes the textbook comes alive"

"You might have a Bleep, we need a CT scan"

"I would feel pain in my Bloop, next."

Dr. Cameron chimes in "A bloop, we need to run a x-ray for the number legs pain".

"Despite appearances my leg works fine. I'm holding this because Santa nevers gives me real one." Marky walks normal for a few steps, then goes back to limping again.

"Well I'm underwhelmed. Just because the symptoms can talk doesn't make them less important." Mark hobbles over to a whiteboard, grabs a marker and writes:

"SYMPTOMS
Pain in chest in mid-anterior chest.
Numb below knees.
Sweeling in the in the right wrist.
"

"Bleep bleep bloop." Says Dr. Cameron.

"Yes. It's wrong but not bad. Missing the green hue around the eyes."

"Bloop beep". Says Dr. Blue.

"That makes sense. I'm impressed. Let's go for a ultrasound."

Marky walks out of the room, of course he's limping and using his candy cane grinning with a satisfaction fit for a kid opening gifts Christmas morning.

The doctors follow. The nurses and Tyler, the medicine errand boy are left in the room. Tyler says to a nurse, "That was special."

Marky leads the doctors to the ultrasound. They both accompany the sick kid for the test. Applying the gel, using the probe to send sonar waves through the skin to receive a remarkable clear picture of what lies underneath.

The doctors are fascinated. They point at several anomalies on the screen and speak among themselves. Marky is still playing the leader, pacing with his cane. He does lots of tests and blaw blaw.

Twenty minutes later or so, they're all back at the first room.

Dr. Cameron. "Thank you Mark. We have a much better understanding of what's wrong. We need to speak to your mother, and have a long talk. There's more to know then what we can see.".

"You can't do that."

"Why?"

"In what way?"

"This is serious. We need to know more then what you're telling us. Are you on any medications. Do you take any pills?"

"I don't know." An obvious lie. "Just because you don't know what the right answer is, maybe there's even no way you could know what the right answer is doesn't make your answer right or even okay. It's much simpler than that. It's just plain wrong...Can we just return to running tests?"

[should it be a simpler and he's just a patient?]

Marky's on the bed. Sick and all.

A nurse walks past the room. She asks Dr. Blue "what's Marky Mark doing here?". "Excuse me?" replies the doctor.

The nurse walks off to a rack of pamphlets, picks one up and opens to a page. Inside is Marky. His skinny frame and whispy hair are in photo shoot on a hospital floor.

"He's the poster kid for the kids floor."

"He's mother..."

"Hasn't MIA for half a decade. Meth addict. He's got stage three tumours, nevermind a genetic problem with this, and more complications researchers visit him like a sort of sick shrine. Don't tell me you've been treating him?"

"Marky!"
