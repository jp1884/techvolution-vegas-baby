## Introduction

I've got this great story about two friends stealing a monkey from a zoo. They saw an ad with a cute little monkey, and being higher than astronauts, they dreamed-up a surprisingly ingenious plan to get a new pet.

Their plan worked. These two potheads wanted an exotic animal to play with and they got one. Dreams became reality. How awesome is that!

Problem is they stole a 50 pound baboon instead. Dreams died away as a nightmare was born. Baboons don't make good pets. They're huge, extremely strong, agile, emotional primates. Most concerning for my two friends was the fact baboons have big, loving, protective families.

True to their nature, the baboon's acted fast and made a plan. It wasn't ingenious. It was very aggressive. Baboons gathered. Baboons rampaged. Glass shattered. Metal broke.

My friends were hunted down.

Happily everything worked out. The monkey's got their friend back. The potheads got out okay. And I ended up with a sure fire way to make anyone laugh. All in all society got a good deal. No matter who I've told, happy drunks or suffering souls, everyone's day brightens-up when I tell them the story about two idiots stealing a monkey from a zoo.

People can't help but smile because life hardwired us to love good stories. Dogs love to fetch. Cats love to hunt. I bet even trees smile in their own way when the sun shines. Every life-form on this planet has their path to happiness. For us it's the wonder of a good story.

Yet, and here's my point, everything isn't rainbows and sunshine on Earth. We don't live in the Garden of Eden. Happiness is rare. Life is hard. And while we love sharing our happy and funny stories, sharing our sad ones isn't so easy.

We all have painful stories. We must. Depression, bankruptcy, harassment aren't just words. They're stories lived by real people every day. It's sad but true; we're often living the part of the scared baboon in the story of our lives.

We keep going. It's a credit to us in fact that we keep living and giving ourselves new memories. But what kind of memories are we adding? Are we living our best lives in 2022?

Are we thriving?

We're drawn to happiness like a moth to light, but we learn the most from getting burned. The memories of overcoming failure is the best fuel to pursue our dreams.

Life wants us to embrace the pain of failure. But we too often don't. It's easier to borrow more money then ask for help. Simpler to post a fake smile on Instagram then explain what the smile is covering up. It's definitely easier to binge on Netflix than admit we're increasingly watching alone.

Maybe it's our consumer lifestyle. Maybe it's human nature. Whatever the reason, today we aren't living our fullest lives because we don't reward ourselves, and each other, for experiencing the pain of failure.

Climate change. Enormous debt. Opioid epidemic. These aren't just words. These are nightmares lived by all of us in one way or another. To overcome them we need more fuel; the fuel of more positive stories. The memory of another's perseverance empowers us to become the hero of our own story.

It sucks I'll never hear your stories. I know you've added some great chapters to the story of life. But I am happy I'm going to tell you this story. No, I'm not going to tell you about the poor baboon lured into a car trunk. Since I have you here, I'm going to tell you a much better story.

This story will give you memories. Delightfully happy ones, and tear jerking, crying on the pages, sad ones. This is a song of happiness and sorrow. This is a story about a person brave enough to always embrace the pain of turning dreams into memories. Just as Life wants us to live. Always fighting for happiness. Never scared of the pain. The hero of this story proudly shared the entire journey to teach us all how to live a better life.

I'm going to tell you a story about two kids visiting an Emergency Room. I'm going to tell you a story about the one who never left.

## Candy Cane

A big glass revolving door. Its purpose is to spin. It spins and spins because it keeps people moving.

It's moving loads of people tonight. A steady stream of people are coming in, and the door keeps sending them back out to resume their lives.

On the outside is a downtown city street. The streets are filled with slow moving cars. The sidewalks have fast moving people. There's a gentle snowfall blanketing everything. Streetlamps, headlights, and Christmas lights bounce off the snow in all directions.

A pair white sneakers jumps into the spin of the big glass doors. The shoes follow the slow motion of the revolving door, go inside the building, and stop on the thick black carpet that has "Hopedale Hospital" written in large pink letters.

The white shoes first steps are stomps that kick-off fluffy white snow from the shinny white shoes. The stomps are rhythmic, and when they stop, a pair of skinny hands wipe white powder from blue jeans, a bulky winter jacket, and a big thick navy blue Canada Goose toque.

Free from snow, the kid, Mark, stops and looks around.

It's a young face, just about to turn a teenager. Happy with his cleaning job, Mark pulls a candy cane from inside his jacket. He twirls the treat. The red and white cane twirls between the fingers; like a pencil in the hands of a mathematician thinking of an equation.

The treat stops spinning. Mark pulls out a pocket knife, cuts the plastic, and peels it back. Soon he's tasting the the white and red Christmas treat.

Happy with his treat, Mark looks around a hospital Emergency Room.

There's about 50 chairs inside this ER. It's 8pm, so it's a high traffic time, a time when each chair is filled with a sick person, or someone sick with worry.

From behind a desk a nurse asks the kid, "Hi, can you please take a seat."

Mark politely goes to the nurse and takes a seat.

"Thank you." says the nurse. "Now please, can you please tell me where it hurts.". Mark steals another look at the waiting room. He then looks back at the nurse.

"It's my stomach. I feel queasy. I was at a Christmas party and my mom thinks I ate something bad there. I snuck in some eggnog but don't tell her."

The nurse looks up. There's a lady wrapped in layers from head to toe standing behind Mark. She doesn't say anything. Instead she hands the nurse a piece of paper, presumably the insurance details.

"Her English isn't so good. Portuguese. I'll translate."

"Oh, okay. Do you feel like you have to vomit?"

"Like my teacher just called a pop quiz. Candy canes help for some reason."

"Okay, we'll get you looked at. Please take this bag--please use it--and we'll call you soon"

"Will it be long?"

"Maybe an hour and you'll be on your way." Mark responds with; "An hour, that's nothing. Thank you."

The introductions done, the nurse finishes her paperwork before looking for another person to admit. Marky gets up, walks towards the waiting room, and looks around.

There's only a few empty chairs spattered around.

Marky still sucks on his candy. He walks through the rows, and finds himself a seat. None for his mother, so she's forced to sit a row away. Being a foreigner she's used to giving her kid the reigns when they're out in public.

As Mark's mother, Carolina is her name by the way, takes out her crossword puzzle, Mark is in his chair, surrounded by strangers, sucking his candy cane.

He's looking around. Scoping the place out. Scoping the people out. Younger, older, white, black, male, female. A nice eclectic group of people.

We've all been here before. Like any bus, train, or waiting room, a bunch of people are sitting together, in a community they share, all with much in common.

Some are chatting with whoever they came with. Some read magazines, newspapers. But most everyone, is staring into their smartphones.

Marky looks around at each person. It's either YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Netflix.

Marky asks the person next to him "What are you watching?"

His neighbor says "The Office".

"Why are you watching it?"

"I love this episode. It's the one where Michael wears women's clothes?" the strangers responds barely breaking eye contact.

"You know what happens? Why are you watching it?"

"It's funny."

"That sounds horrible boring. Wanna see a magic trick?"

The Michael Scott fan pulls his head up and waits. A few people glance over.

Mark takes a candy cane out. He presents it like a magicians are apt by twirling it in his hands until he shakes his hand, once, twice, and bam....

Out comes two candy canes.

It's a neat trick.

"I've seen better." says the Michael Scott fan.

"You've seen a magic show!" Mark's eyes beam.

"American's Got Talent has them all the time, they're so amazing. Yours was okay."

Michael Scott goes back to his phone.

"Everyone wants to be the star" says a teenage girl to Mark.

"Hey, what is your name?" He gets ignored.

"Jim"

"I'm Mark. Where are you from, why are you here Jim?"

Jim blurts out coldly "That's very inappropriate" and goes back to his phone.

"I was just curious. Wanted to know more about you." Still nothing. "I have a stomach ache." Mark finishes but still isn't getting any takers.

The teenage girl, with eyes filled with frustration and a voice overflowing with angst, "Yes! Please stop. I didn't come here to talk to you."

Ants communicate with each other all the time. But ants don't have vocal cords so they can't talk. Being almost blind strikes out sign language too. But ants are part of a community, a community that works together so darn much scientists call ant colonies a super-organism. And individual ants can come together into strong communities because ants smell and so ants use chemicals called pheromone to tell each other everything.

Whenever you see ants moving, builder, hunting like they're one unit, it's all coordinated with chemicals.

And that is what this teenage girl does with Mark. She crushes him, shames him with virtual pheromones to shut the fuck up, sit there, and wait his turn at the fate of the doctor's verdict.

Mark doesn't just stop talking. He gets the message the girl wants to force on him.

- Note, and this is important, Marky finds dull people. No one wants to socialize. These characters aren't like in the sitcoms. They're guarded and anxious, or just fucking boring, people with no story to tell but Netflix (mean GO train girl).  Marky wants to engage and exchange (perhaps about his illness?), but finds nothing but dead air.

- note, most people are dressed well. they're prepared, it not experiencing an emergency.

- It's then that Marky invents (relives his own story as it turns out) his real story, with his real mother. Which starts below....

Just then a new person walks into the ER. A young mother clutching a toddler. The mother is dressed in random clothes. She walks past the occupied triage nurse and grabs a seat.

A row of chairs has opened up near the back. The mother sits down, holding her covered kid in her arms.

It's a nice image. One for a movie, like the ones everyone else is watching on their smartphones.

Marky takes in the image. He even draws it on his hand. It being Christmas, he can't help but think of Mary holding a sick Jesus trying to find some help for an ailment.

Even Jesus must have had sprained ankle, cold, or stomach flu.

Marky looks at her some more, and takes in the image. He sees what anyone would see. A very stressed mother holding her kid in a ER waiting room.


She's thirtish, with baggy eyes ruffled clothes. She totally ignored the ideals of fashion. At a corporate job she's be sent home for breaking the rules. But no one can make her leave here, because she holds her child. The little girl is so wrapped in her mother's arms, bundled up so much and held so tight we can't even see the tike.

Care for a sick kid and you'd look and be doing the same thing as this poor mother. Or maybe this mother is so cranked out on opioids she's beat her child pretending it was another baseball accidents requiring more painkillers; or from an addicts vantage point "lifegivers" might be a better name.

Viruses, diseases, bacteria are evil bastards. But so are human greed, deception and addiction. And that brings us make to our ongoing story filled with happy and sad twists and turns. A regular person sitting across from another can't know what form of evil the other chair is suffering from.

She does. At least she gets close the charge nurse does. The person so in charge they put in right in her name. She screens everyone who comes in and tells them where to go and who to see. This place is filled with stories, and for a few minutes she's director of everyone's life.

"A loving mom is such a nice image. Like a movie poster. Even in this place. I'm sure everything will be fine."

The mother turns. "Thank you."

Marky continues. "I've got a stomach ache. I was at my mother's Christmas party and I snuck in a drink of eggnog and wow... Candy canes soothe the pain for some reason. But my mom said I had to come here."

Just now, Marky stomach cramps and his fist grips in response to the pain. Jennifer eyes widen.

Marky smirks, takes a second and crunches down on the last bit of candy, "Time for another. Does your daughter want one?". The sick kid, a girl of five or six, lifts her head. Marky smacks his hands together and looks at the mother's hand, which is now holding the candy cane; one so beautiful it looks like it was made by Santa's best pastry chef.

"Magic.", says the boy. "I was performing at the party. I can't wait to get back out there. I wanted to ask you, when I walked in I said you might know this question. Do you think mountains, places, hospitals, have memories? Can they remember happy and sad?"

The angst in the question distracts the mother. For the first time in hours she thinks about something else other then her pain.

"I suppose they do. I know I'm adding some memories right now."

"I'm sure they'll be happy ones."

The charge nurse yells out, "Jessica, Jessica please come with me." The mother rises with her daughter.

"Good luck. God Bless." says a smiling Marky. "Thank you, you too" Jessica says as she walks away. "Let's go Samantha, it's our turn. Remember what we talked about". The toddler is distracted, happily taking in at her new candy.

Marky watches the mother and daughter go with the nurse. It's a heartfelt image, one fit for a photograph, and once that makes Marky say with disdain. "Addict."

Marky opens up another candy. A middle age man looks at the artistic treat, and Marky asks, "How are you feeling tonight?".

"Sprained my ankle."

"If hospitals have memories, I don't think it'll remember that one."

---

Although the any Emergency Room is a place of a thousand memories lived during countless stories, this ER isn't moving at the pace of a hit TV show. Most of the chairs in the waiting room are empty. No one is talking to the triage nurse.

Marky is chatting with one of the few people left. They're talking about their favorite Netflix shows. Marky runs through a list like streaming veteran, each of with the other guy share their favorite scenes, shows and actors.

Eventually Marky name is called.

He gets up, and goes with the nurse. There's been a shift rotation. The nurse  is different now.

"Let's go Mark."

"Marky"

"Oh sorry. Let's go Marky. Who are you here with?"

"My mom. She just went to feed the meter."

"Okay, we'll we can get started. How are you feeling tonight?"

"Feel okay. Waiting to hear what you think though. Yourself?"

"It's been a long night."

A walking cane leaning against the wall. It's a festive one and looks like a candy cane, just like one of the artistic treats Marky has been using.

Marky grabs it. He grips the handle, and starts to walks like his right leg is suddenly useless.

"Lots of sprained ankles out there."

"Lots of everything out there." The nurse says before nothing "I hope you don't really need that. Do you know whose that is?". Marky is chewing on the candy again and so takes a second to respond, "Oh, I saw the guy who left it behind. I'll put in the lost and found when I get out of here."

Nurse says "Such a good guy. Well let's go inside that room and we'll see what's wrong."

The two walk past a room with the mother Jessica and her kid. The little five year old is sitting in the bed in a gown with an electrode wire attached to her arm.

Marky stops and stares at the image. In a world filled with good and bad, the image of a mother with her sick kid is one that can embody both love and despair in a single frame. A black hole sun. A memory to last a lifetime that anyone would hope has a happy ending.

Mark pulls out another candy cane. This one is a real beauty, flashes of red, green, bits of blue tinsel. And the top it off is a crown of gold. One fit for a princess.

Marky leaves the piece of art on the window sill. The mother is living the sadness and doesn't notice, but the daughter does. The earlier gift lifted her spirits and now this one inspires a smile.

The nurse says "Let's go Marky."

Marky continues on. The memories of happy or sad living it's way in the minds of the mother, daughter, before this memories lodges itself inside the mind of a person, to creates a person with it's memories of happy and sad, and now it includes both, because Marky and his gifts of candy gave a kid a glimmer of hope during a time of despair.

- banter
- he delays
- talks about a canker sore
- he meets Tyler who jokes with him

Marky walks into the examination room. "Please close the door and we'll see what's wrong with your...tummy is it?" Marky nods and closes the door.

"Okay take off your shirt please."

"Do I have to?"

"Um, well if your tummy hurts I have to see it".

"I'd rather not, but you need to?"

"Yeah, I know it's a bit cool, but I hopefully won't be long." Marky looks around. He doesn't want to, but is too nice to make it an issue. He gives up and takes off jacket. Then his sweater. This is thinner sweater.

Marky keeps talking his layers. "Wow, someone doesn't like the cold." Marky stops at turtle neck, and goes to sit on the bed. "Everything, please Marky." She goes to table to grab a pair of latex gloves. She's putting them on and puts on her stethoscope, and turns around.

She sees Marky shirtless. A image that reveals his story, a story of a kid of 10 or 12 that was very much hidden under layers. Layers meant to protect from the pain of winter hide the pain of kid living with pain.

"Marky...." mumbles the nurse. She takes in the new image, the new memory and this one will stay in her story forever.

He's frail, skinny and malnourished. There are burns across his chest. Cigar sized. There's even a needle mark on his arm. This is beside the huge scar in his side. The nurse hopes to herself it's from a surgery.

"Where is your mother?" asks the sorrowful nurse, said with pain in her voice that tells us how much the memory is sinking in. "I never know how to answer that one." replies Marky. "But my tummy does hurt."

Marky gets up on the bed and lies down. The nurse goes over, and starts her examination. She places the stethoscope all over the chest, heart, and lungs.

- imply the mother wanted Marky to gain meds, but left. That's the House story for this chapter, that's only true in Marky's origin story he's reliving.

---
 
First examination....
- ends with Marky being diagnosed with some serious stuff, while Jennifer walks out with a cold. Mixing extremes, and the theme, of happy and sad. Remember it ends with a poster image of the mother/life Marky never had.
  
---

White laminate floor tiles go on and on. Until wheels spin over top them at a breakneck pace. The bangs of heavy medical equipment sound out. White running shoes and hospital gowns hustling along the rubberized hallway.

A man is pushing the heavy medical equipment as a nurse runs beside him. "Every week has one. Does it Tyler" she says to him.

As the equipment nears her room, Jessica the mother gets up and rushes to the door. And here enters the hidden evil of this iconic image. The mother of a sick kid is scared, and all she wants is for this medical contraption, whatever it's heavenly purpose is born to defeat an evil she never wants to see. As the nurses rush faster towards Jessica she stands and comes to the window.

But the gang of healers pass by the stay at home mom, rush into the room next door. Jessica the loving mother puts her hands to mouth in a genuine gesture whose intent she'll never admit. Jessica then sees the candy cane. She walks a bit out her door and sees the image, and makes another memory.

Marky is on the bed, filled with wires that make him look like an experiment. The contrast between this room and the sick girl is large. Marky really upped the intensity. Happy and sad may be at odds, but that doesn't mean there aren't levels to each almost as big as they are too each other.

As the medical staff are saying their beeps and bops, Marky is on the raised bed. He's looking at each staff, following their motions like he's watching a merry go round.

Jessica can't look away. She's startled, scared, yet fascinated. This is a memory in the making. The thing the loving mother feared would happen to her daughter is happening to this boy, this stranger. She would hate herself for thinking it consciously, but she doesn't, because her subconscious is demanding to find out what happens next.

She's watching a story she'll never forget.

And this boy, this young spunk of a kid, is sitting there calm and gentle. "Why is he holding a giant candy cane?" she blurts to herself. The object is so out of place you or you (or I) would think the same thing.

But then another weird thing happens. Marky looks over at her, makes eye contact, and mouths to the mother "Playing helps." He holds his cane up just a bit to show his new friend how pretty it is.

Mark puts his hands up, waving at the orchestra of medical professions. They slow and slow and slow until he has the floor, he whimpers "What am I suppose to be feeling?"

For a second, just a second the healers orchestra stare. The image of a boy holding a giant candy cane burns into the mother's memory.

Dr. Blue asks "Are you feeling something new Mark?... Is the pain somewhere outside your stomach."

"I can't take a full breath." Dr. Cameron grabs her stethoscope, puts it on skinny chest, and listens. The young doctors eyes enlarge and her lips pucker. She looks at Dr. Blue, who responds "we need a CT scan now."

"It's not operating at this time." She returns to Mark "Are you sure your mother only went to check the car parking?"

"Yeah"

"We're going to need to run a lot of tests okay. We'll tell your mom all about them, but we can go ahead right now okay?"

"If you think it's best. What are you thinking?"

"That you're a brave young man, and we're going to make you all better."

"That sounds like a good idea". Dr. Cameron nod her head in sympathy, she's looks at the nurses and is thinking to herself the odds of a single person, never mind a kid, being so sick.

"Should I keep going?"

"What else are you feeling."

"Something, but it's what I'm not feeling that's starting to freak me out."

Marky sits up in the bed. So before we run tests, I'd like to hear your ideas for a diagnosis for. Seems prudent. Let's see who can get the sick kid his diagnosis."

The medical staff freezes.

"Don't just stand there like a bunch of kids waiting to talk to Santa. It's time to get to work, you know diagnostics." So frozen are the staff, they don't even object when Marky removes several diodes. He gets up and walks around, using his cane because his right leg is now useless.

"You there Dr. Cameron and Dr. Blue, and you, who are you?"

"Tyler"

"And what's your role?"

"My role?"

"Um yeah, what do you do here? Anthensia, cardiology, NP"

"I delivery medicines on the weekends."

"A red cavalier among a park of Mercedes" snorts Marky. "Okay, Blue, Cameron, what do you think is wrong. Let's get it all out on the table"

"I'll answer any question." says Mark. Dr. Blue asks Jennifer the mother "Are you the mother". Jennifer promptly waves her head no.

"She's not. Come on. Sometimes the textbook comes alive"

"You might have a Bleep, we need a CT scan"

"I would feel pain in my Bloop, next."

Dr. Cameron chimes in "A bloop, we need to run a x-ray for the number legs pain".

"Despite appearances my leg works fine. I'm holding this because Santa nevers gives me real one." Marky walks normal for a few steps, then goes back to limping again.

"Well I'm underwhelmed. Just because the symptoms can talk doesn't make them less important." Mark hobbles over to a whiteboard, grabs a marker and writes:

"SYMPTOMS
Pain in chest in mid-anterior chest.
Numb below knees.
Sweeling in the in the right wrist.
"

"Bleep bleep bloop." Says Dr. Cameron.

"Yes. It's wrong but not bad. Missing the green hue around the eyes."

"Bloop beep". Says Dr. Blue.

"That makes sense. I'm impressed. Let's go for a ultrasound."

Marky walks out of the room, of course he's limping and using his candy cane grinning with a satisfaction fit for a kid opening gifts Christmas morning.

The doctors follow. The nurses and Tyler, the medicine errand boy are left in the room. Tyler says to a nurse, "That was special."

Marky leads the doctors to the ultrasound. They both accompany the sick kid for the test. Applying the gel, using the probe to send sonar waves through the skin to receive a remarkable clear picture of what lies underneath.

The doctors are fascinated. They point at several anomalies on the screen and speak among themselves. Marky is still playing the leader, pacing with his cane. He does lots of tests and blaw blaw.

Twenty minutes later or so, they're all back at the first room.

Dr. Cameron. "Thank you Mark. We have a much better understanding of what's wrong. We need to speak to your mother, and have a long talk. There's more to know then what we can see.".

"You can't do that."

"Why?"

"In what way?"

"This is serious. We need to know more then what you're telling us. Are you on any medications. Do you take any pills?"

"I don't know." An obvious lie. "Just because you don't know what the right answer is, maybe there's even no way you could know what the right answer is doesn't make your answer right or even okay. It's much simpler than that. It's just plain wrong...Can we just return to running tests?"

[should it be a simpler and he's just a patient?]

Marky's on the bed. Sick and all.

A nurse walks past the room. She asks Dr. Blue "what's Marky Mark doing here?". "Excuse me?" replies the doctor.

The nurse walks off to a rack of pamphlets, picks one up and opens to a page. Inside is Marky. His skinny frame and whispy hair are in photo shoot on a hospital floor.

"He's the poster kid for the kids floor."

"He's mother..."

"Hasn't MIA for half a decade. Meth addict. He's got stage three tumours, nevermind a genetic problem with this, and more complications researchers visit him like a sort of sick shrine. Don't tell me you've been treating him?"

"Marky!"
