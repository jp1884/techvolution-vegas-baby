- Iconic Memories?

## Emile Teaches Us To Stargaze

*Yeah... first time I made this [butter scotch rum] was for your mother.  I'd been wanting to pop the question but I was afraid she'd say no. This gave me the nerve to ask her and I got myself a great big "yes"... and that wasn't the only "yes" I got from her that night either. [laughs] Still scares me to think how close I came to chickening out, though. You know, as you get older, it's not the failures you regret, or the times you made an ass of yourself. It's the times you never even tried, when you just lost your nerve.*

## Prologue

I've got this great story about two friends stealing a monkey from a zoo.

The two guys were watching TV, smoking lots of weed, seemingly happy...until an ad with a cute little monkey came on.

They usually ignore commercials of course, but they watched this one in awe. It was the monkey. The primate wasn't doing anything too special. He was jumping around a zoo play pen, taking fruit from people's hands, and playing with the zoo keepers. The zoo keepers and the monkey were so happy together.

To the two stoners sitting in a messy suburban basement wasting away their youth, this monkey was a shot of life.

No that's not it; this monkey was a shot at life.

After the commercial ended one friend said, "We need a monkey".

Their was only one possible reply,

"Today".

Seems silly, but a monkey motivated my friends to improve their lives.

They jumped into action.

No teachers, no bosses, no supervision needed; their dreams animated their bodies.

They assembled what they had in hand--rope, fruit, IDs--into an ingenious plan. With smiles ear to ear--and their once all important television show playing in the background--they set out for a small regional zoo.

And?

And their plan worked. These two potheads wanted to reboot their lives with a energetic new friend, and they did.

Their dreams became reality. Anyone can change their lives! How awesome is that!

There are problems here of course...animal rights, theft...but the biggest roadblock was something else entirely. You see, once my friends got to dream, they kept dreaming.

Good for them you might say!

Well for one their joints grew too (of course they kept smoking), but their dreams got so big they bypassed the small monkeys entirely.

Instead they stole a 50 pound baboon.

Baboons don't make good pets. They're not cuddly like Ross' monkey Marcel on *Friends*.  Baboons are extremely strong and emotional primates; and that's not the worst part. The scary fact is baboons live in big, loving, very protective families.

This stolen baboon certainly did.

This family acted fast and made a plan. It wasn't ingenious. It was very aggressive. Baboons gathered. Baboons rampaged. Glass shattered. Metal broke.

For a few minutes, on the fields of a regional zoo, my two pothead friends were hunted down by a family of murderous baboons.

Happily everything worked out. The monkey's were reunited. My friends got out okay. And I ended up with a sure fire way to make anyone laugh.

All in all, society got a good deal. No matter who I've told, happy drunks or suffering souls, everyone's day brightens-up when I tell them the story about two idiots stealing a monkey from a zoo.

People can't help but enjoy the story. Dogs love to fetch. Cats love to hunt. I bet even trees smile when spring sunshine comes. Life gifted every life-form a way to happiness; ours is the joy of a good story.

But why? I understand why life wants trees to grow, elephants to graze, birds to soar; each serves an eco-system that helps life prosper. But why does reading, telling, or living stories make us so happy?

How do good stories help life?

Because stories are about someone fighting for their dreams. And what are dreams? Our motivation to improve our lives, our families, or our society. It could be getting into shape or curing cancer, it doesn't matter, fighting for our dreams is the story of life on Earth.

Yet, here's my point, everything isn't rainbows and sunshine on our planet. We don't live in the Garden of Eden. Happiness is rare. Most tree saplings don't find sunlight. Most hunts fail. Elephants are often starving while they roam the Serengeti looking for something to eat.

Life on Earth is not happy by default. Life is usually live in pain.

Humans are no different. Most real-life stories don't have Hollywood endings. And while humanity loves sharing our stories of success, sharing our sad failures isn't so easy.

We all have painful stories. We must. Depression, bankruptcy, harassment aren't just words. They're terrible stories lived by real people every day. You're probably reading this right now trying to forget something in your life. Perhaps your dreading going to work because of an abusive boss. Or you hate your phone's ring-tone because it means more time talking to debt collectors. With so much pain, it's easy to think our dreams will never come true.

Maybe that's why nightmares like climate change, enormous debt, opioid epidemic keep getting worse. We dream of a better world without these problems, but we don't believe we can overcome the pain needed to make our dreams of a better world come true.

Life needs us to overcome the pain of failure and keep dreaming.

It's too bad I'll never hear your stories. I know you've added some great chapters to the story of life. But I am going this story. No, I'm not going to tell you about the poor baboon lured into a car trunk. Since I have you here, I'm going to tell you a much better tale.

This story will give you dreams. You'll cry on the pages in complete despair and smile into your pillow in utter happiness, but each twist and turn will motivate you to embrace the pain needed to turn your dreams into reality.

Just as life wants us to live. Always fighting for happiness. Never scared of failure. Embracing anxiety, disappointment, and despair because the truth is unlived dreams are the only ever-lasting agony. The hero of this story fights for their dreams, accepts misery, and teaches us all we can all live a better life.

I'm going to tell you a story about two kids visiting an Emergency Room. I'm going to tell you a story about the one who never left.

## Candy Cane

A big glass revolving door spins. It spins and spins. It keeps spinning because that's what it does; it keeps people moving so they can live their lives.

This spinning door is moving lots of people tonight. Individuals keep stepping into the moving metal and glass to enter the building while others are leaving to resume their lives.

On the outside is a downtown city street. The cityscape has been the backdrop to human stories since the it was constructed in the late 1800s. Brick buildings, narrow roads; shops, bars, and restaurants  everywhere. This city was built to be facilitate a thriving society. Today the narrow city roads are filled with slow moving cars. The sidewalks have fast moving people coated against winter cold.

The gentle snowfall covers the city like a blanket on a sleeping newborn. The streetlamps, headlights, and Christmas decorations turn the city into a dreamscape fit for the first sight of a newborn.

In fact, an artist is walking in the city but decides to stop. She takes out the sketch pad she has everywhere, takes a seat on a park bench and starts her craft. This is an image worth a memory.

The artists pencil outlines the gothic buildings, statues, the couple walking hand in hand while window shopping, and the finally she draws the spinning door still doing it's part to keep the street alive and people moving.

Just now a pair white sneakers jumps into those spinning doors. The shoes follow the slow motion of the revolving metal and glass, until finally going inside the building. The shoes stop on the thick black carpet that has "Hopedale Hospital" written in large pink letters.

The white shoes stomp and stomp and stomp. The stomps continue and break into a dub-step dance. The dancer makes a point to kick-off fluffy snow from their moving shoes.

Of course other people keep coming and going into the hospital. These people don't stop and wipe themselves clean of salt and snow. Instead they walk past the dancing kid and spread gunk with every step.

But this kid keeps dancing and keeps taking the time to remove all the shit from outside. Only when finally clean does the kid stops. He's out of breadth but he's beaming a smile in self-satisfaction.

The kid's name is Mark. He's just about to turn a teenager, but looks young for his age. Maybe that's why he pulls a candy cane from inside his jacket with such glee.

It's a high-end treat. Probably made by a pastry chef. The treat has deep red and bright white swirls, a snappy looking huge bow and even some tinsel too. If the artist saw this candy cane she'd devote a gallery painting to it no doubt; the candy cane defines Christmas dreams.

Mark twirls the treat like a pencil in the hands of a mathematician thinking of an genius equation. When he stops out comes a pocket knife. Mark cuts the plastic off the candy cane with delicate care.

Enjoying the Christmas treat it deserves, Mark looks around the Hopedale hospital Emergency Room.

It's 8pm. A high traffic time. Almost all 50 chairs are filled. Before Mark can look anymore, a nurse sitting behind a desk asks Mark, "Hi, can you please take a seat." She's the triage nurse and assess everyone for their illness.

Mark politely goes to the nurse and takes a seat.

"Thank you." says the nurse. "Can you please tell me where it hurts.". Mark steals another look at the waiting room. He then looks back at the nurse.

"It's my stomach. I feel queasy. I was at a Christmas party and my mom thinks I ate something bad there. Maybe I did. But I definitely snuck in some eggnog though. Don't tell her."

The nurse looks up. There's a lady, Carolina, wrapped in layers from head to toe standing behind Mark. She doesn't say anything. Instead she hands the nurse a piece of paper, presumably the insurance details.

"Her English isn't so good. Portuguese. I'll translate."

"Oh, okay. Do you feel like you have to vomit?"

"Like my teacher just called a pop quiz. Candy canes help soothe the pain for some reason."

"When you press on your stomach, is there any sharp pains, like a pin is sticking into your skin?" Mark shakes his head.

"Okay, please take this bag and please use it if you need to. We'll call you soon."

"Will it be long?"

"Maybe an hour and you'll be on your way." Mark responds with; "An hour is doable. Thank you."

- remember Mark needs to get back to his room quickly.
- Carolina has a short break.
- nasty customer disrupts the nurse, so she fails to properly check Marky in the db. Inciting incident?

The nurse finishes up her paperwork. Mark gets up, walks towards the waiting room, and again looks around the ER.

He's not looking at the few empty chairs spattered around. He's looking at the full ones. There's a host of people here. Elderly, young, girls, boys. Who will he sit beside?

Marky sucks on his candy. He's halfway through the treat. He makes his choice and walks through the rows and seats.

There's no space for Carolina so she sits a row away. She says nothing. Being a foreigner she's used to giving her kid the reins when they're out in public.

As Carolina takes out her crossword puzzle, Mark shuffles in his chair. He's so excited he bites down on his candy cane. To himself he says "How cool is this. To met someone for the first time."

Where to start? What to say?

He's looking around. Scoping the people out. Younger, older, white, black, male, female. A nice eclectic group of people who a few minutes before were sharing that idyllic illustration on the snow covered city streets.

We've all been here before. Like any bus, train, or waiting room, a bunch of people are sitting together, in a community they share, all with much in common.

And most everyone is staring into their smartphones.

Mark looks around at each person fixation on YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, or Netflix.

Mark asks the person next to him "Hi, what's going on?"

His neighbor says "The Office".

"Oh that's cool. Which episode?"

"It's the one where Michael wears women's clothes." The strangers responds barely breaking eye contact.

"Oh that one's good. I won't ruin it for you."

"I've seen it before."

"You have? Why are you watching it again?"

"It's funny."

"Wanna see a magic trick instead?"

The Michael Scott fan pulls his head up and waits. A few people glance over.

Mark takes a candy cane out. He presents it like a magician by twirling it in his hands until he shakes his hand, once, twice, and BAM!....

Out comes two candy canes.

It's a neat trick. The Michael Scott fan thinks to himself he was probably hiding the treat in his baggy coat sleave.

A few people smile. But everyone goes back to their phones.

"Everyone wants to be the star" says a teenage girl to Michael Scott.

"Hey, what is your name?" Mark asks the girl. He gets ignored.

"I was just curious. Wanted to know more about you." Still nothing. "I have a stomach ache." Mark finishes but still isn't getting any takers.

- he has to pry more, what's wrong with you, and you.

Words are great but not perfect. Sometimes our thoughts can't be put into words.

Most every other life form doesn't even use words. Take ants. They don't have vocal cords and are nearly blind. Ants communicate using chemicals called pheromones.

Whenever you see an huge ants hunting or building a nest, all that communication happens with these pheromones. They have no choice but to respond to commands from the colony.

I'm not wasting your time here. I mention this for a reason. Because anytime words won't do, we humans respond by sending out signals just like ants do. Smiles, screams, hugs and what's happening right now, the look of shame.

And that is what this teenage girl does with Mark. She crushes him, shames him with virtual pheromones to shut the fuck up, sit there, and wait his turn to see the doctor.

Mark doesn't just stop talking. He gets the message the girl wants to force on him. He should shut up.

- Note, and this is important, Marky finds dull people. No one wants to socialize. These characters aren't like in the sitcoms. They're guarded and anxious, or just fucking boring, people with no story to tell but Netflix (mean GO train girl).  Marky wants to engage and exchange (perhaps about his illness?), but finds nothing but dead air.

- note, most people are dressed well. they're prepared, ie not experiencing an emergency.

- It's then that Marky invents (relives his own story as it turns out) his real story, with his real mother. Which starts below....

Just then a new person walks into the ER. A young mother clutching a toddler. The mother is dressed in random clothes. She almost jumps to the triage nurse and grabs a seat.

The nurse and mother talk. The nurse picks up her phone and starts talking while directing the scared mother to take a seat in the waiting room.

This case looks more serious than the others.

A row of chairs has opened up near the back. The mother walks to the open seats. She sits down and holds a kid covered with blankets.

You might not think it, it's not the scene of the gentle snowfall outside, but this is a memorable image to another who cares to look. A mother caring for her sick kid.

Nobody cares to look. Except Mark.

He takes the scene in. Looking about thirty, with baggy eyes and ruffled clothes this mother totally ignored the ideals of fashion. At a corporate job she'd probably be sent home for breaking the rules. But now she doesn't care, because she holds her child. The little kid is so wrapped in her mother's arms, bundled up so much and held so tight we can't even see the tike.

Marky take out a notepad. A quality notepad at that. Shinola brand, hand made in Detroit. He sketches the image with decent skill. It being Christmas, he can't help but make the image look like Mary holding a sick Jesus.

Marky sketches. He's thinking to himself, "Even toddler Jesus must have had broken arm or stomach flu when he was growing up."

Mark turns the mother's hat into a veil, blankets into loin clothes, and teary eyes into loving ones. When he finishes the sketch, he signs it. Then he rips it out of his notebook. He gets up, and walks over to the mother and sick kid.

"I drew this for you."

The mother looks up. Before even looking at the sketch she says "Oh my God. Thank you." Then the mother takes it in. It's her and her kid as a work of art. She's getting a pheromones now; that somebody cares.

She gives it back.

"This is a wonderful piece of art. You have talent. Thank you so much." She hands it back to Mark.

"No, keep it. It's a gift." The mother's mouth, so strained with worry and sleeplessness, moves into broad smile.

Now her toddler looks at it. Together the parent and child have a moment; art giving them true pain relief.

The moment passes and Mark asks, "What's the matter? I have a stomach ache. Or I drank too much eggnog." Mark says the last part with a cheeky grin.

"We don't know what's wrong. She's feverish, with a pain in her left arm."

"Does this hurt?" Mark presses the toddler's palm. Mark gets a "yes" in response. "Well that's a good sign."

"Why?" asks the mother.

"It means her blood is flowing fine. I'm a bit of a rascal so I've had lots of stupid injuries. Do you know what the best medicine is?..."

Mark puts his artistic candy cane in his mouth. Mark continues "if you tell the nurses candy helps the pain, you can keep it all the time." Mark looks at the hand of the sick kid, the mother and her child follow his lead.

The toddler smiles when she sees the treat.

"Candy!" Mark says to her. "Candy is always the best medicine, right?"

"Right!" says the kid.

The mother, toddler, and a stranger, laughing in an ER. If places have memories, this will stick around here for a while.

"Mary" a nurse yells out. The mother turns her head, no longer laughing. She takes her kid and goes with the nurse. Mark says behind.

It sure was nice having a break. A laugh, maybe any distraction, might be the best medicine for anyone who's sick. And this gorgeous candy cane is doing the trick for Mary's sick kid. She's smiling while going towards her fait.

Marky takes out another candy. But he puts it away. He's found something more interesting. A cane, a real cane. And it's decorated in holiday spirit. Marky grabs it and uses it, as if he has a limp in his right leg.

He walks, with a limp, over to a  a middle age man and asks, "How are you feeling tonight?".

"Sprained my ankle."

While looking at Mary and Jessica Marky says "If hospitals have memories, I don't think it'll remember that one."

---

Mary sits on a chair. Jessica sits on the examination table. That's something no mother wants to see. But Mary is putting on a brave face.

Jessica is wearing a happy one. She's holding her candy cane. The treat still has the plastic wrapping but that doesn't stop Jessica from pretty much tasting it. All her attention is on this treat. Yours would be too.

Mary appreciated the gift more and more. The reality is something to be distracted from. "Looks good doesn't it Jess." says the mother. The kid enthusiastically nods her head. Mary thinks to herself "Wow."

In walks the doctor.

- a loving examination follows
- this introduces the medical tests, lifestyle, that Mark lives through.

In the background, in the hallway, walks Marky, using the cane of course. He looks inside the room. He sees Jessica sitting in the bed in a gown with an electrode wire attached to her arm.

Marky stops and stares at the image. In a world filled with good and bad, the image of a mother with her sick kid is one that can embody both love and despair in a single frame. A black hole sun. A memory to last a lifetime that anyone would hope has a happy ending.

Mark pulls out another candy cane. This one is a real beauty, flashes of red, green, bits of blue tinsel ripples through the eyes of anyone lucky enough to see the edible work of art. And the top it off is a crown of gold; one fit for a princess.

Marky leaves the treat on the window sill. No one notices, but Jessica does. The earlier gift lifted her spirits and now this one inspires a smile.

 - more examination....

But that's it. Thank the heavens she's going to be okay.

The real drama is happening somewhere else.

---

- banter
- he asks about Mary and Jessica. Mainly about Jessica, his idyllic mother.
- he meets Tyler who jokes with him
- when to enter this scene? building up with some examination, or straight to the shock of his illness?

Marky has his hear against a porcelain cup. The cup is pressed against a wall. He's listening to the conversation next door.

In walks the nurse. "Hi there, Mark is it?"

"Yes."

"Well Mark, where are your parents?"

"She's paying the meter."

"Oh...okay... well let's get started. Why don't your tell me where the pain is."

"Is she going to okay?"

"Who?"

"The girl next door. Black hair, big smile, her mother is as sweet as Taylor Swift."

"Taylor Swift?"

"It's a high bar and she happens to met it"

"Well then good for her. They're running some tests, but I think she'll be okay for sure. Can we start talking about you."

"You sound just like Taylor"

"Oh really, you speak with her often?"

"Every Friday."

"That's great. Well say hi for me the next time you speak with her. Tell her we could use her at the next fundraiser."

"I'll bring her on a date. Right at the nice courtyard around the corner. The one with the cherry trees."

"Excellent spot very romantic. Now...let's go where does it hurt?"

"You know. It's not hurting so bad. Maybe, yeah I think I can go."

"Take it easy fella you running a race. When you're mom gets here she can decide if you want to leave. For now, let's just talk. And while your dates with Miss Taylor Swift is wonderful topic I want to hear about you. It says here you have a tummy ache. What does the tummy pain feel like?"

Isn't it interesting. Dreams are so hard to nail down. Like paintings in the mist. But pain you can test and find no problem. It's almost like our bodies are just pain detectors. And this nurse is getting concerned this kid isn't talking.

She catches Marky looking at the clock. The time piece is analog so it's taking a second for the boy to figure out the minute hand.

"Mark, where are your parents?"

Marks says nothing. All the whimsey, character, and stories are gone. He's scared.

"Take off your jacket because I need to see if your sick."

Mark follows the command. Most people follow commands and he's just a kid after-all.

The now worried boy takes off the jacket. There's a thick sweater. He doesn't even wait for the command to take it off. Another sweater, then a long sleeve t-shirt, a toque, and finally the white pair of sneakers that danced the snow off at the entrance not 25 minutes ago.

Soon Mark is standing there, in his jeans, socks and a under-shirt. The nurse is standing there too, and she's in awe.

A nightmarish awe.

She sees an image that starts this story, a story of a kid of 10 or 12 that was very much hidden under layers. Layers meant to protect from the cold of winter hid the pain of...

Something this long-time medical professional doesn't see very often.

A medical mystery.

"Marky...." mumbles the nurse.

He's frail, skinny, and malnourished. There are what looks like burns across his chest. Cigar sized. There's even a needle mark on his arm. This is beside the huge scar in his side. The nurse hopes it's from a surgery.

"Where is your mother?" asks the nurse with a tinge of anger in her voice.

"I never know how to answer that one." replies Marky. "But my tummy does hurt."

Marky gets up on the bed sits on it. The nurse goes over, and starts her examination. She places the stethoscope all over the chest, heart, and lungs.

- imply the mother wanted Marky to gain meds, but left. That's the House story for this chapter, that's only true in Marky's origin story he's reliving.

This nurse, whose name is Betty by the way, has been around. And she's well passes the threshold she came here to know, this patient needs to be admitted and the ER doctors needs to be called. Likely a number of specialists too.

Mark is soon alone again in the room. The nurse left to get reinforcements. He again picks up the cup and listens in next door.

He hears what's going on next door. Mary is singing softly to Jessica.

"Rudolf the red nose reindeer, had such a shiny nose. And if you ever saw him, you could even say it glows...."

Mark smiles and closes his eyes. This Christmas song is taking him away to some place, and he's in so deep he doesn't notice a doctor open and close the door.

Dr. Cameron watches Mark. She's got not idea what's he's really doing, but being a proper scientist she doesn't interrupt. She observes.

Soon the nurse returns and she tells the doctor "she's singing rudolf to her child".

"Tells us a lot" says Dr. Cameron. It takes a little while, but Marky eventually lets off the cup and looks at the doctor.

"Hi Mark. I'm Doctor Cameron. It's nice to met you."

"Nice to meet you too" replies Mark.

"Thank you. Now I'm here to do something called an examination. We have people outside looking for your mother..." This gives Mark a fright, another observation to note down. "But we're going to go ahead now ok? The rules give me the responsibility to make sure you're healthy."

Mark nods. The examination starts. The doctor and nurse do what they do. Touch here, prod that. Press down.

Marky doesn't get involved. He's the ideal patient and simply does what he's asked. And what he's asked is a simple, "does this hurt?"

Pain is the sign of truth.

The five minute examination is done. Marky is left in the room alone again.

Outside the nurse and doctor compare notes. They exchange a host of medical problems. We've heard many of the words before on television dramas. Diseases from lupus to typhoid. Happily the rule out child abuse.

They're going to need more tests and more doctors.

"Every week has one true medical problem" says the nurse.

"This is once a year." replies the doctor

As they look around, Marky is picking up the cup again, taking it to the wall, and listening to another Christmas carol.

"Where's the mother?

---
 
First examination....
- ends with Marky being diagnosed with some serious stuff, while Jennifer walks out with a cold. Mixing extremes, and the theme, of happy and sad. Remember it ends with a poster image of the mother/life Marky never had.
  
---

White laminate floor tiles go on and on. Until wheels spin over top them at a breakneck pace. The bangs of heavy medical equipment sound out. White running shoes and hospital gowns hustling along the rubberized hallway.

A man is pushing the heavy medical equipment as a nurse runs beside him. "Every week has one. Does it Tyler" she says to him.

As the equipment nears her room, Jessica the mother gets up and rushes to the door. And here enters the hidden evil of this iconic image. The mother of a sick kid is scared, and all she wants is for this medical contraption, whatever it's heavenly purpose is born to defeat an evil she never wants to see. As the nurses rush faster towards Jessica she stands and comes to the window.

But the gang of healers pass by the stay at home mom, rush into the room next door. Jessica the loving mother puts her hands to mouth in a genuine gesture whose intent she'll never admit. Jessica then sees the candy cane. She walks a bit out her door and sees the image, and makes another memory.

Marky is on the bed, filled with wires that make him look like an experiment. The contrast between this room and the sick girl is large. Marky really upped the intensity. Happy and sad may be at odds, but that doesn't mean there aren't levels to each almost as big as they are too each other.

As the medical staff are saying their beeps and bops, Marky is on the raised bed. He's looking at each staff, following their motions like he's watching a merry go round.

Jessica can't look away. She's startled, scared, yet fascinated. This is a memory in the making. The thing the loving mother feared would happen to her daughter is happening to this boy, this stranger. She would hate herself for thinking it consciously, but she doesn't, because her subconscious is demanding to find out what happens next.

She's watching a story she'll never forget.

And this boy, this young spunk of a kid, is sitting there calm and gentle. "Why is he holding a giant candy cane?" she blurts to herself. The object is so out of place you or you (or I) would think the same thing.

But then another weird thing happens. Marky looks over at her, makes eye contact, and mouths to the mother "Playing helps." He holds his cane up just a bit to show his new friend how pretty it is.

Mark puts his hands up, waving at the orchestra of medical professions. They slow and slow and slow until he has the floor, he whimpers "What am I suppose to be feeling?"

For a second, just a second the healers orchestra stare. The image of a boy holding a giant candy cane burns into the mother's memory.

Dr. Blue asks "Are you feeling something new Mark?... Is the pain somewhere outside your stomach."

"I can't take a full breath." Dr. Cameron grabs her stethoscope, puts it on skinny chest, and listens. The young doctors eyes enlarge and her lips pucker. She looks at Dr. Blue, who responds "we need a CT scan now."

"It's not operating at this time." She returns to Mark "Are you sure your mother only went to check the car parking?"

"Yeah"

"We're going to need to run a lot of tests okay. We'll tell your mom all about them, but we can go ahead right now okay?"

"If you think it's best. What are you thinking?"

"That you're a brave young man, and we're going to make you all better."

"That sounds like a good idea". Dr. Cameron nod her head in sympathy, she's looks at the nurses and is thinking to herself the odds of a single person, never mind a kid, being so sick.

"Should I keep going?"

"What else are you feeling."

"Something, but it's what I'm not feeling that's starting to freak me out."

Marky sits up in the bed. So before we run tests, I'd like to hear your ideas for a diagnosis for. Seems prudent. Let's see who can get the sick kid his diagnosis."

The medical staff freezes.

"Don't just stand there like a bunch of kids waiting to talk to Santa. It's time to get to work, you know diagnostics." So frozen are the staff, they don't even object when Marky removes several diodes. He gets up and walks around, using his cane because his right leg is now useless.

"You there Dr. Cameron and Dr. Blue, and you, who are you?"

"Tyler"

"And what's your role?"

"My role?"

"Um yeah, what do you do here? Anthensia, cardiology, NP"

"I delivery medicines on the weekends."

"A red cavalier among a park of Mercedes" snorts Marky. "Okay, Blue, Cameron, what do you think is wrong. Let's get it all out on the table"

"I'll answer any question." says Mark. Dr. Blue asks Jennifer the mother "Are you the mother". Jennifer promptly waves her head no.

"She's not. Come on. Sometimes the textbook comes alive"

"You might have a Bleep, we need a CT scan"

"I would feel pain in my Bloop, next."

Dr. Cameron chimes in "A bloop, we need to run a x-ray for the number legs pain".

"Despite appearances my leg works fine. I'm holding this because Santa nevers gives me real one." Marky walks normal for a few steps, then goes back to limping again.

"Well I'm underwhelmed. Just because the symptoms can talk doesn't make them less important." Mark hobbles over to a whiteboard, grabs a marker and writes:

"SYMPTOMS
Pain in chest in mid-anterior chest.
Numb below knees.
Sweeling in the in the right wrist.
"

"Bleep bleep bloop." Says Dr. Cameron.

"Yes. It's wrong but not bad. Missing the green hue around the eyes."

"Bloop beep". Says Dr. Blue.

"That makes sense. I'm impressed. Let's go for a ultrasound."

Marky walks out of the room, of course he's limping and using his candy cane grinning with a satisfaction fit for a kid opening gifts Christmas morning.

The doctors follow. The nurses and Tyler, the medicine errand boy are left in the room. Tyler says to a nurse, "That was special."

Marky leads the doctors to the ultrasound. They both accompany the sick kid for the test. Applying the gel, using the probe to send sonar waves through the skin to receive a remarkable clear picture of what lies underneath.

The doctors are fascinated. They point at several anomalies on the screen and speak among themselves. Marky is still playing the leader, pacing with his cane. He does lots of tests and blaw blaw.

Twenty minutes later or so, they're all back at the first room.

Dr. Cameron. "Thank you Mark. We have a much better understanding of what's wrong. We need to speak to your mother, and have a long talk. There's more to know then what we can see.".

"You can't do that."

"Why?"

"In what way?"

"This is serious. We need to know more then what you're telling us. Are you on any medications. Do you take any pills?"

"I don't know." An obvious lie. "Just because you don't know what the right answer is, maybe there's even no way you could know what the right answer is doesn't make your answer right or even okay. It's much simpler than that. It's just plain wrong...Can we just return to running tests?"

[should it be a simpler and he's just a patient?]

Marky's on the bed. Sick and all.

A nurse walks past the room. She asks Dr. Blue "what's Marky Mark doing here?". "Excuse me?" replies the doctor.

The nurse walks off to a rack of pamphlets, picks one up and opens to a page. Inside is Marky. His skinny frame and whispy hair are in photo shoot on a hospital floor.

"He's the poster kid for the kids floor."

"He's mother..."

"Hasn't MIA for half a decade. Meth addict. He's got stage three tumours, nevermind a genetic problem with this, and more complications researchers visit him like a sort of sick shrine. Don't tell me you've been treating him?"

"Marky!"

## Entropy's Is The Reasons Why

"By now you might be thinking if there's anything you could have done. The short answer is no. The long answer is I didn't want you too.

I didn't want you too because I didn't want to give up. So I decided to take my life. It was the only way to live with dreams.

If you want to understand this, you must know what it is to dream. Actually dream of something you want to do. Write a book, earn a medal, start a band, sail around the world.

If I lived it would been dreamless. Like a sail, our souls needs dreams to keep moving.

I'm tired of the shit. The complete bullshit. I spend all day with people I lie to. How fucked up is that. Then I spend the rest of my day buying shit I didn't make. Or worse, coming over to see someone's new shit I don't care about.

You know anyone who killed themselves over a counter-top? It's because no one was inspired to dream about one either.

It was the pain. The pain of a million shocks, from a million wounds. The pain of burdens, of wounds, of having to smile them off. The pain of no longer being able to justify this is our species?

99.9999 of all species life's populated this little globe with have gone from it. There was something better suited to keeping life alive against the pain of fighting entropy.

Life has this tiny little beach head on a marble twirling in a vacuum, being bombarded by radiation; a fingertip on a ledge. And still our worst enemies aren't that!

It's caring so much that killed me. I can't stop fighting for the good side. I can't defeat the dark side. The pain of hunger, war, despair is the only cure to humanity's problems. My death will help more than my life.

It's the irony that killed me. People can be so amazing. From the scientists working all day to make some pill that cures a sickness, to the janitor cleaning up the lab so it's ready to go on the next session. The two can spark a friendship that forges devotion and loyalty across all the weapons of entropy.

Brought together with life's beautiful tools of friendship persons have conquered so much. Yet at every level, from every angle, there's the greed, lust. We'd be better off never knowing each other. So easy do we make it for ourselves by taking from others.

I didn't want to keep alive on the fuel of hate.

- want to know what it's like. give up. whatever you're doing. stop it....
