## Emile Teaches Us To Stargaze

*Yeah... first time I made this [butter scotch rum] was for your mother.  I'd been wanting to pop the question but I was afraid she'd say no. This gave me the nerve to ask her and I got myself a great big "yes"... and that wasn't the only "yes" I got from her that night either. [laughs] Still scares me to think how close I came to chickening out, though. You know, as you get older, it's not the failures you regret, or the times you made an ass of yourself. It's the times you never even tried, when you just lost your nerve.*

## Prologue

I've got this great story about two friends stealing a monkey from a zoo.

They were watching TV, vegging out, smoking lots of weed; a typical weekend for the two potheads; until an ad with a cute little monkey came on.

They usually ignore commercials of course, but they watched this one in awe. This little monkey was jumping around a zoo play pen, drinking from a bottle, eating fruit from people's hands. But my friends were awestruck by something else. The zoo keepers and the monkey were so happy playing together.

This monkey was a shot of life. No. This monkey was a shot at life. The commercial soon ended and it didn't take long until one friend said what both were thinking, "We need a monkey".

Their was only one possible reply; "Today".

The friends got to work. Their dreams unlocked untold ingenuity. They assembled rope, fruit, sugar, a car, IDs, cash into an ingenious plan. With supplies in hand, smiles ear to ear, they set out for a small regional zoo.

And?

And their plan worked. These two potheads wanted to reboot their lives by getting a energetic pet, and they got one.

Dreams became reality. Anyone can change their lives! How awesome is that!

Their are problems here of course...animal rights, theft...but the biggest roadblock was something else entirely. With all the dreams floating around their heads, my friends went bigger. Bigger with their marijuana joints (of course they kept smoking) and their goals. They went so big they forewent a small monkey and instead stole a 50 pound baboon.

I want you to picture the difference between a tiny monkey and a baboon. Take it seriously because it's important. Small monkeys can make people happy. Ross on *Friends* had Marcel the monkey for years. But baboons don't make good pets. Why? Because they're extremely strong, agile, and emotional primates.

But most concerning is baboons live in big, loving, very protective families. This stolen baboon certainly did.

And true to their nature, this baboon family (called troops) acted fast and made a plan. It wasn't ingenious. It was very aggressive. Baboons gathered. Baboons rampaged. Glass shattered. Metal broke.

For a few minutes, on the fields of a regional zoo, my two pothead friends were hunted down by a troop of murderous baboons.

Happily everything worked out. The monkey's were reunited. My friends got out okay. And I ended up with a sure fire way to make anyone laugh.

All in all, society got a good deal. No matter who I've told, happy drunks or suffering souls, everyone's day brightens-up when I tell them the story about two idiots stealing a monkey from a zoo.

People can't help but enjoy hearing the story. Dogs love to fetch. Cats love to hunt. I bet even trees smile when spring warmth comes. Life gifted every life-form a way to happiness; ours is the joy of a good story.

But why? Why does telling, sharing, watching, reading, or experiencing stories make us so happy? I get why life wants trees to grow, elephants to graze, birds to soar; each serves to help life prosper. So how do stories help live prosper?

Because stories are about someone fighting for their dreams. And that's how you and me help life prosper, by fighting for our dreams of living a better life.

Yet, here's my point, everything isn't rainbows and sunshine on our Earth. We don't live in the Garden of Eden. Happiness is rare. Most tree saplings don't find sunlight. Cats often don't have anything to hunt.

Life on Earth is usually not happy.

Humans are no different. Our heroes usually fail because most real-life stories don't have Hollywood endings. And while humanity loves sharing our stories of success, sharing our sad failures isn't so easy.

We all have painful stories. We must. Depression, bankruptcy, harassment aren't just words. They're terrible stories lived by real people every day. It's sad but true; instead of living our dreams, we're often living the part of the scared baboon.

Yet still, we keep dreaming. With so many obstacles we should be embracing failure as mere pitfalls on our path to happiness.

But we too often don't. It's easier to borrow more money then ask for help. Simpler to post a fake smile on Instagram then explain what the smile is covering up. It's definitely easier to binge on Netflix than admit we're increasingly watching alone.

It's not a surprise our present is no gift. Climate change, enormous debt, opioid epidemic; these nightmares are not being solved by us today because we're not the hero of our own stories today.

That's gotta change. Like my two stoner friends, we all still dream of improving life on Earth.

It sucks I'll never hear your stories. I know you've added some great chapters to the story of life. But I am happy I'm going to tell you this story. No, I'm not going to tell you about the poor baboon lured into a car trunk. Since I have you here, I'm going to tell you a much better tale.

This story will motivate your dreams. You'll cry on the pages with complete despair, and smile into your pillow in utter happiness, but each twist and turn will be a memory to fuel your dream chasing until your embrace the pain. Just as Life wants us to live. Always fighting for happiness. Never scared of failure. The hero of this story fights for their dreams, takes the pain, and teaches us all how to live a better life.

I'm going to tell you a story about two kids visiting an Emergency Room. I'm going to tell you a story about the one who never left.

## Candy Cane

A big glass revolving door spins. It spins and spins. It keeps spinning because that's its purpose; keep people moving so they can live their lives.

This spinning door is moving lots of people tonight. Individuals keep stepping into the spinning metal and glass to enter the building while others are leaving to resume their lives.

On the outside is a downtown city street. The city has been the backdrop to human stories since the it was first constructed in the late 1800s. Today the narrow city roads are filled with slow moving cars. The sidewalks have fast moving people coated against the winter cold.

The gentle snowfall is covers the city like a blanket on a sleeping newborn. This city beams with the same illuminate of a baby; the streetlamps, headlights, and Christmas decorations turn the city into a dreamscape.

In fact, an artist was walking in the city and decided to stop. She's now sketching. This is an image worth a memory.

The artists pencil outlines the gothic buildings, the statue of some important person nobody remembers, the couple walking hand in hand while window shopping, and the finally she draws the spinning door still doing it's part to keep the street alive and people moving.

Just now a pair white sneakers jumps into the doors. The shoes follow the slow motion of the revolving door, then go inside the building. The shoes stop on the thick black carpet that has "Hopedale Hospital" written in large pink letters.

The white shoes stomp, and stomp and stomp. The stomps break into a dub-step dance as they kick-off fluffy snow.

The dancing continues despite all the people who keep coming and going into the hospital. These people don't stop and wipe themselves clean of salt and snow. Instead they walk past the dancing kid and spread gunk with every step.

But this kid takes the time to remove all the shit from outside. Only when finally clean does the kid stops.

The kid's name is Mark. He's just about to turn a teenager, but looks young for his age. Maybe that's why he pulls a candy cane from inside his jacket with such glee.

It's a high-end treat with distinct red and white swirls, a snappy looking bow and even some tinsel too. It's a treat made by an artisan no doubt. Mark twirls the treat; like a pencil in the hands of a mathematician thinking of an equation.

Finally, Mark pulls out a pocket knife, and cuts the plastic off the candy cane.

Sucking on the white and red Christmas treat, Mark looks around the Hopedale hospital Emergency Room.

It's 8pm, so it's high traffic time so almost all 50 chairs are filled. From behind a desk a nurse asks Mark, "Hi, can you please take a seat." She's the triage nurse and assess everyone for their illness.

Mark politely goes to the nurse and takes a seat.

"Thank you." says the nurse. "Can you please tell me where it hurts.". Mark steals another look at the waiting room. He then looks back at the nurse.

"It's my stomach. I feel queasy. I was at a Christmas party and my mom thinks I ate something bad there. Maybe I did. definitely snuck in some eggnog though. Don't tell her."

The nurse looks up. There's a lady, Carolina, wrapped in layers from head to toe standing behind Mark. She doesn't say anything. Instead she hands the nurse a piece of paper, presumably the insurance details.

"Her English isn't so good. Portuguese. I'll translate."

"Oh, okay. Do you feel like you have to vomit?"

"Like my teacher just called a pop quiz and I spent all week being Master-chief saving Earth from the terrible aliens. Candy canes help soothe the pain for some reason."

"Okay, please take this bag and please use it if you need to. We'll call you soon."

"Will it be long?"

"Maybe an hour and you'll be on your way." Mark responds with; "An hour is doable. Thank you."

- remember Mark needs to get back to his room quickly.
- Carolina has a short break.

The nurse finishes up her paperwork. Mark gets up, walks towards the waiting room, and again looks around the ER.

He's not looking at the few empty chairs spattered around. He's looking at the full ones. There's a host of people to choose from. Elderly, young, girls,.... Who to sit beside?

Marky sucks on his candy. He's halfway through the treat. He makes his choice and walks through the rows and seats.

There's no space for Carolina so she sits a row away. She says nothing. Being a foreigner she's used to giving her kid the reigns when they're out in public.

As Carolina takes out her crossword puzzle, Mark is in his chair, surrounded by strangers, sucking his candy cane, thinking how cool it is. To see a person who you're about to met for the first time.

Where to start? What to say?

He's looking around. Scoping the people out. Younger, older, white, black, male, female. A nice eclectic group of people who a few minutes before were sharing that idyllic illustration on the snow covered city streets.

We've all been here before. Like any bus, train, or waiting room, a bunch of people are sitting together, in a community they share, all with much in common.

And most everyone is staring into their smartphones.

Mark looks around at each person. It's mostly YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Netflix.

Mark asks the person next to him "Hi, what's going on?"

His neighbor says "The Office".

"Oh that's cool. Which episode?"

"It's the one where Michael wears women's clothes." The strangers responds barely breaking eye contact.

"Oh that one's good. I won't ruin it for you."

"I've seen it before."

"You have? Why are you watching it again?"

"It's funny."

"That doesn't make sense. Wanna see a magic trick instead?"

The Michael Scott fan pulls his head up and waits. A few people glance over.

Mark takes a candy cane out. He presents it like a magician by twirling it in his hands until he shakes his hand, once, twice, and BAM!....

Out comes two candy canes.

It's a neat trick. A few people smile. But everyone goes back to their phones.

"Everyone wants to be the star" says a teenage girl to Mark.

"Hey, what is your name?" Mark asks the girl. He gets ignored.

"I was just curious. Wanted to know more about you." Still nothing. "I have a stomach ache." Mark finishes but still isn't getting any takers.

- he has to pry more, what's wrong with you, and you.

The teenage girl, with mild frustration. "Please stop. I didn't come here to talk to you."

Words are great but it can be hard to communicate everything with words. Sometimes a look, a view, an emotion can't be put into words.

Every other life form makes do of course. Take ants. They don't have vocal cords and they're nearly blind so they only communicate using chemicals called pheromones.

Whenever you see ants moving, builder, hunting like they're one unit, it's all coordinated with massive amount of pheromones. Ants respond to these chemicals like an addict. They have no choice but to respond to commands from the colony.

I'm not wasting your time here. I mention this for a reason. Because anytime a person is getting out of line, humans respond by sending out signals just like ants do.

And that is what this teenage girl, the Michael Scott fan, and Jim does with Mark. She crushes him, shames him with virtual pheromones to shut the fuck up, sit there, and wait his turn to face the doctor's verdict.

Mark doesn't just stop talking. He gets the message the girl wants to force on him. He should shut up.

- Note, and this is important, Marky finds dull people. No one wants to socialize. These characters aren't like in the sitcoms. They're guarded and anxious, or just fucking boring, people with no story to tell but Netflix (mean GO train girl).  Marky wants to engage and exchange (perhaps about his illness?), but finds nothing but dead air.

- note, most people are dressed well. they're prepared, ie not experiencing an emergency.

- It's then that Marky invents (relives his own story as it turns out) his real story, with his real mother. Which starts below....

Just then a new person walks into the ER. A young mother clutching a toddler. The mother is dressed in random clothes. She almost jumps to the triage nurse and grabs a seat.

The nurse and mother talk. The nurse directs her to take a seat before picking up the phone. This case looks more serious than the others.

A row of chairs has opened up near the back. The mother walks as quickly to that sit as she did the other. When there the mother unfurls her sick toddler.

It's a nice image. You might not think it, it's not the scene of the gentle snowfall outside, but this memorable image to another who cares to look. A mother caring for her sick kid.

Nobody cares to look. Except Mark.

He takes the scene in. Looking about thirty, with baggy eyes ruffled clothes this mother totally ignored the ideals of fashion. At a corporate job she'd probably be sent home for breaking the rules. But now she doesn't care, because she holds her child. The little kid is so wrapped in her mother's arms, bundled up so much and held so tight we can't even see the tike.

It's a movie image, like the ones everyone else is watching on their smartphones.

Marky take out a notepad. A quality notepad at that. Shinola brand, hand made in Detroit. He sketches the image with decent skill. It being Christmas, he can't help but make the image look like Mary holding a sick Jesus.

Marky sketches. He's thinking to himself, "Even toddler Jesus must have had broken arm or stomach flu when he was growing up."

He finishes the sketch. Signs it. Then he rips it out of his notebook. He gets up, and walks over to the mother and sick kid.

"I drew this for you."

The mother looks up. "Oh my God. Thank you. This is beautiful." The mother takes in the gestures. It's her and her kids as a work of art. She's getting a pheromones now; that somebody cares.

She gives it back.

"No, keep it. It's a gift." The mother's mouth, so strained with worry and sleeplessness smiles.

Now her toddler looks at it. Together the parent and child have a moment; art giving them true pain relief.

"What's the matter? I have a stomach ache. Or I drag too much eggnog." Mark says the last part with a cheeky grin.

"We don't know what's wrong. She's feverish, with a pain in her left arm."

"Does this hurt?" Mark presses the toddler's palm. Mark gets a "yes" in response. "Well that's a good sign."

"Why?" asks the mother.

"It means her blood is flowing fine. I'm a bit of a rascal so i've had lots of stupid injuries. Do you know what the best medicine always is?..."

Mark puts another artistic candy cane in his mouth. Somehow the mother and her toddler have ones in their hands too. Mark continues "if you tell the nurses candy helps the pain, you can keep it."

The toddler smiles. "Candy!" Mark says to her.

And now the iconic image has the mother, toddler, and a stranger, laughing in an ER.

"Mary" a nurse yells out. The mother turns her head, no longer laughing. She takes her kid and goes with the nurse. Mark says behind.

Now it's time we meet our hero and join her story. The one filled with memories.







The charge nurse yells out, "Jessica, Jessica please come with me." The mother rises with her daughter.

"Good luck. God Bless." says a smiling Marky. "Thank you, you too" Jessica says as she walks away. "Let's go Samantha, it's our turn. Remember what we talked about". The toddler is distracted, happily taking in at her new candy.

Marky watches the mother and daughter go with the nurse. It's a heartfelt image, one fit for a photograph, and once that makes Marky say with disdain. "Addict."

Marky opens up another candy. A middle age man looks at the artistic treat, and Marky asks, "How are you feeling tonight?".

"Sprained my ankle."

"If hospitals have memories, I don't think it'll remember that one."

---

Although the any Emergency Room is a place of a thousand memories lived during countless stories, this ER isn't moving at the pace of a hit TV show. Most of the chairs in the waiting room are empty. No one is talking to the triage nurse.

Marky is chatting with one of the few people left. They're talking about their favorite Netflix shows. Marky runs through a list like streaming veteran, each of with the other guy share their favorite scenes, shows and actors.

Eventually Marky name is called.

He gets up, and goes with the nurse. There's been a shift rotation. The nurse  is different now.

"Let's go Mark."

"Marky"

"Oh sorry. Let's go Marky. Who are you here with?"

"My mom. She just went to feed the meter."

"Okay, we'll we can get started. How are you feeling tonight?"

"Feel okay. Waiting to hear what you think though. Yourself?"

"It's been a long night."

A walking cane leaning against the wall. It's a festive one and looks like a candy cane, just like one of the artistic treats Marky has been using.

Marky grabs it. He grips the handle, and starts to walks like his right leg is suddenly useless.

"Lots of sprained ankles out there."

"Lots of everything out there." The nurse says before nothing "I hope you don't really need that. Do you know whose that is?". Marky is chewing on the candy again and so takes a second to respond, "Oh, I saw the guy who left it behind. I'll put in the lost and found when I get out of here."

Nurse says "Such a good guy. Well let's go inside that room and we'll see what's wrong."

The two walk past a room with the mother Jessica and her kid. The little five year old is sitting in the bed in a gown with an electrode wire attached to her arm.

Marky stops and stares at the image. In a world filled with good and bad, the image of a mother with her sick kid is one that can embody both love and despair in a single frame. A black hole sun. A memory to last a lifetime that anyone would hope has a happy ending.

Mark pulls out another candy cane. This one is a real beauty, flashes of red, green, bits of blue tinsel. And the top it off is a crown of gold. One fit for a princess.

Marky leaves the piece of art on the window sill. The mother is living the sadness and doesn't notice, but the daughter does. The earlier gift lifted her spirits and now this one inspires a smile.

The nurse says "Let's go Marky."

Marky continues on. The memories of happy or sad living it's way in the minds of the mother, daughter, before this memories lodges itself inside the mind of a person, to creates a person with it's memories of happy and sad, and now it includes both, because Marky and his gifts of candy gave a kid a glimmer of hope during a time of despair.

- banter
- he delays
- talks about a canker sore
- he meets Tyler who jokes with him

Marky walks into the examination room. "Please close the door and we'll see what's wrong with your...tummy is it?" Marky nods and closes the door.

"Okay take off your shirt please."

"Do I have to?"

"Um, well if your tummy hurts I have to see it".

"I'd rather not, but you need to?"

"Yeah, I know it's a bit cool, but I hopefully won't be long." Marky looks around. He doesn't want to, but is too nice to make it an issue. He gives up and takes off jacket. Then his sweater. This is thinner sweater.

Marky keeps talking his layers. "Wow, someone doesn't like the cold." Marky stops at turtle neck, and goes to sit on the bed. "Everything, please Marky." She goes to table to grab a pair of latex gloves. She's putting them on and puts on her stethoscope, and turns around.

She sees Marky shirtless. A image that reveals his story, a story of a kid of 10 or 12 that was very much hidden under layers. Layers meant to protect from the pain of winter hide the pain of kid living with pain.

"Marky...." mumbles the nurse. She takes in the new image, the new memory and this one will stay in her story forever.

He's frail, skinny and malnourished. There are burns across his chest. Cigar sized. There's even a needle mark on his arm. This is beside the huge scar in his side. The nurse hopes to herself it's from a surgery.

"Where is your mother?" asks the sorrowful nurse, said with pain in her voice that tells us how much the memory is sinking in. "I never know how to answer that one." replies Marky. "But my tummy does hurt."

Marky gets up on the bed and lies down. The nurse goes over, and starts her examination. She places the stethoscope all over the chest, heart, and lungs.

- imply the mother wanted Marky to gain meds, but left. That's the House story for this chapter, that's only true in Marky's origin story he's reliving.

---
 
First examination....
- ends with Marky being diagnosed with some serious stuff, while Jennifer walks out with a cold. Mixing extremes, and the theme, of happy and sad. Remember it ends with a poster image of the mother/life Marky never had.
  
---

White laminate floor tiles go on and on. Until wheels spin over top them at a breakneck pace. The bangs of heavy medical equipment sound out. White running shoes and hospital gowns hustling along the rubberized hallway.

A man is pushing the heavy medical equipment as a nurse runs beside him. "Every week has one. Does it Tyler" she says to him.

As the equipment nears her room, Jessica the mother gets up and rushes to the door. And here enters the hidden evil of this iconic image. The mother of a sick kid is scared, and all she wants is for this medical contraption, whatever it's heavenly purpose is born to defeat an evil she never wants to see. As the nurses rush faster towards Jessica she stands and comes to the window.

But the gang of healers pass by the stay at home mom, rush into the room next door. Jessica the loving mother puts her hands to mouth in a genuine gesture whose intent she'll never admit. Jessica then sees the candy cane. She walks a bit out her door and sees the image, and makes another memory.

Marky is on the bed, filled with wires that make him look like an experiment. The contrast between this room and the sick girl is large. Marky really upped the intensity. Happy and sad may be at odds, but that doesn't mean there aren't levels to each almost as big as they are too each other.

As the medical staff are saying their beeps and bops, Marky is on the raised bed. He's looking at each staff, following their motions like he's watching a merry go round.

Jessica can't look away. She's startled, scared, yet fascinated. This is a memory in the making. The thing the loving mother feared would happen to her daughter is happening to this boy, this stranger. She would hate herself for thinking it consciously, but she doesn't, because her subconscious is demanding to find out what happens next.

She's watching a story she'll never forget.

And this boy, this young spunk of a kid, is sitting there calm and gentle. "Why is he holding a giant candy cane?" she blurts to herself. The object is so out of place you or you (or I) would think the same thing.

But then another weird thing happens. Marky looks over at her, makes eye contact, and mouths to the mother "Playing helps." He holds his cane up just a bit to show his new friend how pretty it is.

Mark puts his hands up, waving at the orchestra of medical professions. They slow and slow and slow until he has the floor, he whimpers "What am I suppose to be feeling?"

For a second, just a second the healers orchestra stare. The image of a boy holding a giant candy cane burns into the mother's memory.

Dr. Blue asks "Are you feeling something new Mark?... Is the pain somewhere outside your stomach."

"I can't take a full breath." Dr. Cameron grabs her stethoscope, puts it on skinny chest, and listens. The young doctors eyes enlarge and her lips pucker. She looks at Dr. Blue, who responds "we need a CT scan now."

"It's not operating at this time." She returns to Mark "Are you sure your mother only went to check the car parking?"

"Yeah"

"We're going to need to run a lot of tests okay. We'll tell your mom all about them, but we can go ahead right now okay?"

"If you think it's best. What are you thinking?"

"That you're a brave young man, and we're going to make you all better."

"That sounds like a good idea". Dr. Cameron nod her head in sympathy, she's looks at the nurses and is thinking to herself the odds of a single person, never mind a kid, being so sick.

"Should I keep going?"

"What else are you feeling."

"Something, but it's what I'm not feeling that's starting to freak me out."

Marky sits up in the bed. So before we run tests, I'd like to hear your ideas for a diagnosis for. Seems prudent. Let's see who can get the sick kid his diagnosis."

The medical staff freezes.

"Don't just stand there like a bunch of kids waiting to talk to Santa. It's time to get to work, you know diagnostics." So frozen are the staff, they don't even object when Marky removes several diodes. He gets up and walks around, using his cane because his right leg is now useless.

"You there Dr. Cameron and Dr. Blue, and you, who are you?"

"Tyler"

"And what's your role?"

"My role?"

"Um yeah, what do you do here? Anthensia, cardiology, NP"

"I delivery medicines on the weekends."

"A red cavalier among a park of Mercedes" snorts Marky. "Okay, Blue, Cameron, what do you think is wrong. Let's get it all out on the table"

"I'll answer any question." says Mark. Dr. Blue asks Jennifer the mother "Are you the mother". Jennifer promptly waves her head no.

"She's not. Come on. Sometimes the textbook comes alive"

"You might have a Bleep, we need a CT scan"

"I would feel pain in my Bloop, next."

Dr. Cameron chimes in "A bloop, we need to run a x-ray for the number legs pain".

"Despite appearances my leg works fine. I'm holding this because Santa nevers gives me real one." Marky walks normal for a few steps, then goes back to limping again.

"Well I'm underwhelmed. Just because the symptoms can talk doesn't make them less important." Mark hobbles over to a whiteboard, grabs a marker and writes:

"SYMPTOMS
Pain in chest in mid-anterior chest.
Numb below knees.
Sweeling in the in the right wrist.
"

"Bleep bleep bloop." Says Dr. Cameron.

"Yes. It's wrong but not bad. Missing the green hue around the eyes."

"Bloop beep". Says Dr. Blue.

"That makes sense. I'm impressed. Let's go for a ultrasound."

Marky walks out of the room, of course he's limping and using his candy cane grinning with a satisfaction fit for a kid opening gifts Christmas morning.

The doctors follow. The nurses and Tyler, the medicine errand boy are left in the room. Tyler says to a nurse, "That was special."

Marky leads the doctors to the ultrasound. They both accompany the sick kid for the test. Applying the gel, using the probe to send sonar waves through the skin to receive a remarkable clear picture of what lies underneath.

The doctors are fascinated. They point at several anomalies on the screen and speak among themselves. Marky is still playing the leader, pacing with his cane. He does lots of tests and blaw blaw.

Twenty minutes later or so, they're all back at the first room.

Dr. Cameron. "Thank you Mark. We have a much better understanding of what's wrong. We need to speak to your mother, and have a long talk. There's more to know then what we can see.".

"You can't do that."

"Why?"

"In what way?"

"This is serious. We need to know more then what you're telling us. Are you on any medications. Do you take any pills?"

"I don't know." An obvious lie. "Just because you don't know what the right answer is, maybe there's even no way you could know what the right answer is doesn't make your answer right or even okay. It's much simpler than that. It's just plain wrong...Can we just return to running tests?"

[should it be a simpler and he's just a patient?]

Marky's on the bed. Sick and all.

A nurse walks past the room. She asks Dr. Blue "what's Marky Mark doing here?". "Excuse me?" replies the doctor.

The nurse walks off to a rack of pamphlets, picks one up and opens to a page. Inside is Marky. His skinny frame and whispy hair are in photo shoot on a hospital floor.

"He's the poster kid for the kids floor."

"He's mother..."

"Hasn't MIA for half a decade. Meth addict. He's got stage three tumours, nevermind a genetic problem with this, and more complications researchers visit him like a sort of sick shrine. Don't tell me you've been treating him?"

"Marky!"

### chapter notes

- after chapter one ordeal, Marky returns to his room/cell. He knows everyone and knows where everything is. He then opens his notebook and ...

## Entropy's Is The Reasons Why

"By now you might be thinking if there's anything you could have done. The short answer is no. The long answer is I didn't want you too.

I didn't want you too because I didn't want to give up. So I decided to take my life. It was the only way to live with dreams.

If you want to understand this, you must know what it is to dream. Actually dream of something you want to do. Write a book, earn a medal, start a band, sail around the world. Dreams are life, they animate our flesh to move.

If I lived it would been dreamless. Like a sail, our souls needs dreams to keep moving.

I'm tired of the shit. The complete bullshit. I spend all day with people I lie to. How fucked up is that. Then I spend the rest of my day buying shit I didn't make. Or worse, coming over to see someone's new shit I don't care about.

You know anyone who killed themselves over a counter-top? It's because no one was inspired to dream about one either.

It was the pain. The pain of a million shocks, from a million wounds. The pain of burdens, of wounds, of having to smile them off. The pain of no longer being able to justify this is our species?

99.9999 of all species life's populated this little globe with have gone from it. There was something better suited to keeping life alive against the pain of fighting entropy.

Life has this tiny little beach head on a marble twirling in a vacuum, being bombarded by radiation; a fingertip on a ledge. And still our worst enemies aren't that!

It's caring so much that killed me. I can't stop fighting for the good side. I can't defeat the dark side. The pain of hunger, war, despair is the only cure to humanity's problems. My death will help more than my life.

It's the irony that killed me. People can be so amazing. From the scientists working all day to make some pill that cures a sickness, to the janitor cleaning up the lab so it's ready to go on the next session. The two can spark a friendship that forges devotion and loyalty across all the weapons of entropy.

Brought together with life's beautiful tools of friendship persons have conquered so much. Yet at every level, from every angle, there's the greed, lust. We'd be better off never knowing each other. So easy do we make it for ourselves by taking from others.

I didn't want to keep alive on the fuel of hate.

- want to know what it's like. give up. whatever you're doing. stop it....
