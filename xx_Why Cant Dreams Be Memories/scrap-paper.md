## Prologue

We keep going. Sometimes with huge victories. Just look how the bravery of the #MeToo movement toppled so many powerful evildoers. It's a credit to us in fact that we keep going.

It would be easy to say we should be happy with what we got. We should be content with our lives. Why risk failure if our lives are good enough.

If you think so then that's cool. But this book is about people fighting for our dreams.

We're drawn to happiness like a moth to light, but we learn the most from getting burned. The memories of overcoming problems is the best fuel to pursue our dreams. And to have good memories, we must also have bad ones too. There is no happiness without sadness.

## Candy Cane

Care for a sick kid and you'd look and be doing the same thing as this poor mother. Or maybe this mother is so cranked out on opioids she's beat her child pretending it was another baseball accidents requiring more painkillers; or from an addicts vantage point "life-givers" might be a better name.

Viruses, diseases, bacteria are evil bastards. But so are human greed, deception and addiction. And that brings us make to our ongoing story filled with happy and sad twists and turns. A regular person sitting across from another can't know what form of evil the other chair is suffering from.



Marky smirks and crunches down on the last bit of candy, "Time for another. Does your daughter want one?". The sick kid, a girl of five or six, lifts her head. Marky smacks his hands together and looks at the mother's hand, which is now holding the candy cane; one so beautiful it looks like it was made by Santa's best candy chef.

"Magic.", says the boy. "I was performing at the party. I can't wait to get back out there. I wanted to ask you, when I walked in I said you might know this question. Do you think mountains, places, hospitals, have memories?"

The question distracts the mother. For the first time in hours she thinks about something else other then her child's pain.

"I suppose they do. I know I'm adding some memories right now."

"I pray they'll be happy ones."

"Why do you say that?"
