Cathy wood is a hero of modern technology. She’s a prominent investor responsible for many cutting-edge inventors getting the money they need to bring cool new technologies to the marketplace. Maybe even some you use.

But before we talk any more about Wood, her heroics, and her tragic flaw, we first must talk about heroes and the stories they live.

—

It’s fair to say everyone loves stories. They entertain us of course. But they do so much more. Stories show us new and exciting cultures we’ll never visit. They gift us emotions we might never feel in our own lives. Most importantly, stories help us communicate the human experience–be it ancient Greece or modern America–across time and space so we can empathize with people we’ll never met.

Stories are so good we use them to educate our kids. The tortoise and the hare. The return of the prodigal son. David and Goliath. We use stories to show our young minds how they should act, what to believe, and how they can change their destiny. And as we grow-up, we keep listening to stories to fuel our better nature as we experience life's many disappointments.

Yet, even though stories expand our minds and enrich our souls, their power is their simplicity. Stories aren't a complex equation only a few can understand. A story is simply about a character wanting something and their heroic struggle to get it.

Will the tortoise beat the hare? Will the good son embrace his trouble-making brother? Will David beat Goliath?

The audience must ask these questions because heroes don’t always get what they want. We call heroes protagonists because they fight to change the world. We call their antagonists villains because they fight back. Villains are happy with the way things are and they viciously antagonize the heroes' quest for change.

That means in every story there is a hero, and every hero has a villain. And only one’s vision of the world can triumph. So both look at each other and say “I will defeat you.”

While we cheer for the hero to prevail, we secretly hope the villain might win. We don’t even call it tragic if he does. After all, a story is boring if there is no tension between the forces of good and evil.

We do call it tragic when heroes defeat themselves.

Heroes are of course human and have faults. Sometimes the hero has a character trait so unhelpful that it causes the hero to fail. Hamlet was so indecisive he never revenged the murder of his father. Romeo and Juliette were so passionate, they never thought through the plan to marry. In many stories the heroes fail not because of their antagonists, but because of their flaws.

Which of course makes these flaws tragic and even sometimes fatal. All the more reason to keep telling these tragic stories so we can learn from them. We need to keep being reminded that all humans, even heroes, have flaws, and these flaws are the source of their failure.

Now what we know about them, let’s use tragic flaws to analyze a real-life story. One about the heroes and villains of innovation.

This is a true life story about a deserted island. Twenty people got stranded on it with no food, water, or shelter and their only tools were a machete and spearfishing rig. Perhaps worse than having little to live with, was that every week the castaways had to vote someone off the island until there was only one survivor left.

Who do you think the winner was?

We don’t have to guess. This story happened on the first season of the show Survivor. Episodes of these twenty castaways captivated television audiences for months. Hours of forging for food, immunity challenges, and voting off castaways helped spawn the reality TV craze of the 2000s.

Even with all the drama on the show, it should be easy to predict who won. The winner was the one guy who could spearfish.

The reason is pretty simple. Without him there was no fish. Quite the powerbase on a deserted island with not much to eat.

And that’s the moral of this story; whoever controls the levers of power in a society usually rule it. The first kings were the best swordsmen. The first internet billionaires were the best coders. Controlling what a society needs gives a person much political power.

Now consider this. What would have happened on that deserted island if someone had invented a fishing rod? What if the inventor created twenty of them?

Would the ruler embrace this innovation? Or suppress it?

That's the hero's dilemma.

It’s by no means a simple answer. While we accept that gold medal winners must race again to win the next competition, our economics isn’t so fair minded. Instead, political leaders and economic bosses often get to decide if the next innovation will see the light of day. And, in human history many heroes (or their descendants) have chosen to reject innovation to keep their power-base.

That’s how yesterday's hero can quickly become today's antagonist.

For example, when Paul Baron designed the first internet (packet switching and node infrastructure if you want to learn about them), he needed the Bell telephone company to embrace the technology. Instead they shut him down repeatedly because it was “technically impossible” to use anything but telephones. If it wasn’t for the Defense Department funding the first internet 10 years later, we might still be using the rotary phones.

It’s the same story for most new technologies. Universities resisted open knowledge with Wikipedia or YouTube lectures. Hollywood resisted online streaming. Tesla faced many lawsuits before it could even sell its cars.

And here we get to our point. Innovation isn't automatically embraced in our society. In fact it’s often suppressed. So while today’s economic heroes invent, fund, and market new technologies, they face antagonists openly fighting them.

Tragically our heroes aren’t fighting back.

Let's get back to our topic, Cathy Wood.

Wood is a fund manager. She invests people's money on the promise to return a profit. She's famous because she’s an early investor in transformative technology. For example, she bet big on Tesla when almost everyone else thought electric vehicle’s were a novelty. Like Elon Musk and Steve Jobs, Wood is a hero of modern technology. She has a brilliant mind who, if I ever had the pleasure to talk with, would teach me far more than I could reciprocate.

I hope she writes a book one day. I'm sure it would change the world. Yet, even with all her advantages, Wood has a tragic flaw.

Wood's investment is called Ark Fund. You can see their extensive portfolio here. Some examples are Teledoc, Unity, 3D printing. Lately her investments are not making good returns. Instead, they're losing lots of money. Wood responds that she's a long-term investor and that her investments will pay off in the future.

Maybe. But heroes are supposed to change the present, not the future. The truth is antagonists, not innovators, are winning in today’s markets and economy at large.

That’s tragic because Ark's companies are worthy of great success right now. They’re not shell companies selling shaddy products. They’re operational with some of the most advanced and well designed products in the marketplace. Even more important, they're needed. Each product essentially does what Netflix did for home entertainment. Teledoc, Zoom, Unity… each make medical, telecommunications, and virtual reality easier to use, cheaper to operate, and give more choices to the end-user.

But Netflix they are not. Not enough people have ever heard of them, used them, or, sadly for Wood, made a profit investing in them.

Losing investors money is terrible of course. But Wood's tragic flaw isn't a market or technical one; it's more profound, more human.

We learn from stories from childhood on, yet we don't think we're living inside one; but we are. Every problem in the real world, from catching fish, making investments, to writing and reading this article, requires technology to solve it.

We live in an ongoing story of technological evolution.

And the hero's dilemma is always there. Every past hero whose  innovation controls a segment of the economy, is a potential villain who can stagnate our technological development. As a result, for every innovator who wants to improve our economy there are often many more stagnators resisting innovation with all their formidable might.

Hogwash, you might be saying. Humanity loves new products. Just look at how quickly everyone bought Netflix or made a smartphone a part of their regular lives.

Innovation is praised far and wide!

Of course we love using new products, but we don't love losing our jobs, positions, and identities when old products are replaced. And there's no policy or support for anyone at an old company welcoming innovation. Perhaps with something like a Universal Basic Income there would be. But those enlightened ideas don't exist yet, so economic antagonism pays better than being laid off and starting a new career.

As a result, many of our workplaces are a museum. It’s comical watching young adults being taught how to use 1990’s software, photocopiers, and fax machines. But the fact is old technology is many people's source of income, prestige, and job security. Even worse, old crappy technology is usually an executive's brainchild and power-base and is thus protected by vanity and greed.

The free-market is supposed to overcome the heroes dilemma and encourage more efficient products win out. It does a good job in the consumer market, where industries like shoes, televisions, and computer games get more advanced every single year.

Sometimes industries change so much they call it “disruption”.

But the free-market is allowed everywhere. When we are consumers, we’re free to to buy our own products. But as workers, we’re told what to use. Call a savvy friend for tech support and he might ask you to download Zoom to solve the problem. Call that same person at a call-centre and you’re stuck using whatever system was put in place from a decision likely made decades ago by people who are either retired or counting down the days to their retirement.

This isn’t trivial. Even 911 call centre don’t have video calls yet.

Heroes like Cathy Wood make amazing techological improvements. One’s what that will improve our world in fantastic ways. But the heroes are not standing up to the antagonists. Thus our world isn’t adopting many new technologies.

Look at Michael Scott from the popular sitcom The Office. Scott is the regional manager of a paper supply company Dunder Mifflin. The company was very successful and for generations helped businesses record and transfer information via paper.

During the show however, Dunder Mifflin struggles as computers, smartphones, and e-readers slowly replace paper. Even so, Scott still proclaims the virutes of his beloved paper to no end. Not least because as a manager he gets to live his fantasy of being funny and popular to employees forced to be his audience.

Scott is an antagonist who resists innovation to keep his job and satisfy his ego. And because no one calls him out, his bevaior is acceptable. But if he were a politician, general, or doctor, we'd call him corrupt for putting his interest above society.

What could Dunder Mifflin do? Billion dollar companies like Shopify, Squarespace, Amazon were born from no resources whilst Scott was defending paper. Although he’s only a regional manager, a true leader would have wanted to solve his customers problems with the best technology available. But that is again the heroes dilemma; and Scott like so many others choose to be an antagonist.

Even if we wanted to call-out antagonists, how could we? The English language has no word for it. There is literally no antonym for innovator. Hot has cold. Up has down. Good has evil. But innovators have no opposite. I use stagnator and antagonist.

Since we don’t oppse them, it’s not surprising stagnators get to antagonize so freely in our economy. Despite inflation, a rising cost of living, and a younger generation stuck without homes, the many innovations that could lower the cost of living is a bad investment right now. The most innovative investment portfolio in the world is bleeding money, while oil is up this year. [Compare old industries to new ones.]

—

So that’s the lesson. We live in a story of technological evolution. We celebrate innovators with appreciation, fandom, and winning reality TV shows. However, all innovators soon face the hero's dilemma. Human frailty means heroes in power often choose to antagonist the innovations of tomorrow to protect their power-base.

Because we don’t call-out these antagonists, they’re let to run amok in our economy.

Only our protagonists can save the day. They must start to recognize their villains, look in their eyes and say I will overcome you. The Tortoise, David, Harry Potter, Cinderella and others did that and won. Many innovative companies, like those supported by Cathy Wood, don’t and are losing.

Thus, Wood should, like us, start to point at stagnators in the face and say, "The world must change. You should help me change it; if not, I will defeat you."

Only then will the innovators connect to users, bring their products to market, get adoption and revenue, become profitable, be a good investment, and be the end of the happy story of constant unopposed innovation in our economy. Of course we should also get users demand to use the best technology in their jobs. Then there would be two attacks against old technologies. Then we’d have the tools to quickly bring the cost of living and inflation rates down.

Integrate being voted off the island into being an antagonist, it's reasonable to protect oneself from a society that doesn't protect innovation.
