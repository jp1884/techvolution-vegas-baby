# INTRODUCTION

## Freeing Cinderella

“Extras are born free; and everywhere they are in chains.” Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote that in 1762. He was the King of France. No he wasn’t. He was the richest man in England. Nope. Rousseau was a poor writer who copied sheets of music to make the rent. More than 300 years later, he is recognized as being a great philosopher, a political visionary, and a protagonist who helped free the world with his new philosophy.

Rousseau lived when kings and queens, dukes and duchesses ruled civilization. A time when Mozart played inside exquisite palaces during the nobility's many banquets and balls. This was the image of opulence that had Cinderella dreaming her days away as she cleaned a dirty chateau. Sadly, unlike the the fairy tale, the extras didn't have a fairy Godmother to make dreams come true. Instead, commoners cleaned noble's vast libraries, used guns while dying in their wars, and wondered what it looked like through a telescope. The extras were excluded from the power of new tools because they believed their beloved Holy Bible said only noble people had the "divine right to rule".

Rousseau called bullshit. In truth, Jesus was a carpenter, and books, guns, and scientific instruments should liberate the extras who were only in chains for the happiness of con artists. The self-proclaimed “divine nobility” didn’t like hearing that. This powerful self-protecting community of Darth Kings declared Rousseau a banquet-pooper, and chased him out of Switzerland, France, and England. Maybe that’s why Rousseau rented instead of owned.

Starting in 1776, within Rousseau’s lifetime, Darth King started to face the music, when the American people started a revolution. One year after he died, the French had one too in 1789. And on it went from country to country because Rousseau, and others like him, discovered the magic words for extras to realize they should become protagonists in a civilization “of the people, for the people, by the people”. Cinderella soon forgot about the fancy ball, and instead played the music of freedom, in a choir of equals that sounded something like this:

>Do you hear the people sing?
Singing a song of angry men?
It is the music of a people
Who will not be slaves again
When the beating of your heart
Echo’s the beating of the drums
There is a life about to start
When tomorrow comes!

Revolutionary songs like this spread the people’s liberty, equality and fraternity throughout the world. In a few years, civilization changed its philosphy from _knowing_ the nobles were divine, to _knowing_ they were villians. When the people took control of books, guns, and science, they put presidents and senators, judges and sherriffs in power, who rulled at the request new protagonists who built a civilization with checks and balances, because no one was divine. A change empowered by tools, thought of in philosophy, yet made real with the bloodshed of revolutions.

Rousseau died never having found a home. After they won their revolutions, a population of heroes put him to rest inside the glorious Panthéon; as a renowned breaker of chains, in a free world he helped build. Where any guy can be the prince, and any girl can be Cinderella.

## Starting Big

Civlization continually makes new tools. The protagonists, antagonists, and extras playout their eternal story of spreading, or witholding their powers in society. Delays cause problems to pile up. Royalist France was bankrupt for generations before it fell to Rousseau's revolutions.

Galileo's first telescope didn't see too far, or too clearly. It could barely make out the moons of Jupiter, or the phases of Venus. Even after he published his work, it took decades of more observations to realize how our solar system worked and replace the old philosophy that the Earth was the center of the Universe.

Thus, I can't tell you which new tool, or company, is better today. I could get close with the movie and insurance industries, but those aren't big enough to matter when trying to topple old philosophies. Techvolution has to start big. And that means mastering the biggest problem caused by Darth Blockbuster; revolutions, which look like this on a map.

How can we move the climactic battle more to the left. So our technological evolution happens without revolutions?

## The Realm of Human Understanding

Education is vital because our problems will never stop. We're basically cyborgs who keep upgrading ourselves to overcome the newest problem. It's because we don't understand the creation of new tools that we let the gatekeepers get in the way of our natural evolution.

We understand much of the Universe. We understand things like gravity, human anatomy, and war. Because we understand these phenomena, we’re slowly mastering how to travel in space, heal the sick, and prevent wars. We weren’t born with this understanding. It takes many years for people to add bits of learning, until one day, a great thinker cracks it and writes a seminal book. Gravity has Sir Isaac Newton and his _Principia_, human anatomy has Andreas Vesalius and his _On the Fabric of the Human Body_, war has Carl von Clausewitz and his _On War_, and equality has Jean-Jacques Rousseau and his _The Social Contract_. Yet revolutions don’t have anything or anyone. Even Rousseau never talked about them. Revolutions are the biggest indication of Darth Blockuster. Once we master revolutions, we'll defeat Darth Blockbuster from our civilization, and slowly replace the old philosophies that keep him alive.

Thus, the purpose of this book is to master revolutions, answer why they happen, and how to prevent them? I build on the work of others, so we can master revolutions like so many other phenomena.

A revolution is a sudden questioning of a civilization’s ruling philosophy. The ruling philosophy is what the extra's like Sophia choose to follow. A ruling philospophy is a civilization's DNA; this was the Holy Bible and its interpretation during Rousseau's time, vile racism in Sophia's.

Every civilization has a ruling philosophy to answer foundational questions like: what is scientific truth? Who should govern? And how should resources be organized? These important questions were once agreed on by all ideologies and factions because, while these groups compete for control of the ruling philosophy, they don’t want to change it too much. Like in Game of Thrones, every faction agrees civilization should be ruled by nobility and monarchs sitting on thrones, but they compete to be the one to sit in it.

A ruling philosophy can be described as civilization’s partnership in all ideals of science, art, virtues, justice, morals, and founding stories of good and bad, right and wrong. Revolutions suddenly want to change civilization’s ruling philosophy—for example, by getting rid of thrones.

The nobility are the gatekeepers of the ruling philosophy. Not necessarily are they Darth Blockbuster. They are group of people who share a mix of characteristics like race, religion, age, gender, family, ideology, or wealth, and they operate civilization's science, politics, or economics by controlling society's tools. Every civilization needs a nobility, because every civilization has a ruling philosophy to defend. Note, I often use “nobility”, but you could reword this as royalty, aristocracy, elites, establishment, authorities—it basically refers to anyone with a hand in guarding the ruling philosophy. The noble families of Europe keeping Cinderella out of the party are one example. The rich senatorial families of Republican Rome, and the voting citizens of ancient Athens are others.

Even though we know what revolutions are, we cannot start one whenever we want. Whether they be scientific, political, or industrial, all revolutions are made possible for the same reason; new and powerful technologies change our world. Transformative technologies like the printing press, telescope, gun, and steam engine enable revolutions because they suddenly change human capabilities, giving us new ways to investigate scientific facts, protect ourselves, or produce goods and services.

However, that’s only one ingredient in the alchemy of revolutions. The next is a build up of delayed adaptions to new technology. This build up happens when the nobility becomes Darth Blockbuster as they resist adapting society to new technology. For example, when the printing press empowered everyone in society to start reading, many nobles refused to accept once upon a time illiterate peasants/extras were increasingly educated people capable of particpating in their own government. But as nobles refused to distribute political power, they turned what should have been a serioes of moderate reforms, into a revolution of sudden ones.

The last incredient is realization. Although new technology enables a new civilization, it's not until the extras realize the potential that a revolution happens. Revolutions are thus triggered when a great thinker writes “magic words” inside seminal books that make extras realize the new options provided by transformative technology. Whether these options are scientific, political, or economic, they give new answers to insert into a civilization’s DNA. If enough people believe in the magic, revolutions start.

The revolution is a battle between Darth Blockbuster and “revolutionaries”. It's a winner takes all battle with both characters fighting to the death on top of a skycraper or some other cool place. Because either the Sun revolves around the Earth, or the Earth revolves around the sun. Either individuals can start a company, or they can’t. Either the people vote about who will be their leader, or they can’t.

Rousseau realized Europe had many transformative technologies. Lots of scientific instruments studying nature, the gun for easy personal protection, and a book obssessed and educated people who could participate in government. Rousseau said these technologies let extras become empowered as full members in civilization, and thereafter explained how to integrate individual liberty and equality into civilization’s DNA. Yet the nobles couldn’t understand and thus became Darth Blockbuster. Belief in the traditional “nobles divine right to rule”, from both the nobility, and some of their subjects, prevented it. This inability to see new DNA options is what Rousseau meant when he said “Man is born free; and everywhere he is in chains”. Chains are unconscious loyalty to a ruling philosophy from antagonists and extras; which is why they’re often only broken by violent revolutions.

We can change that. We can master revolutions once we understand two things very well. The ruling philosophy a civilization uses to organize itself, and our technological development that will someday discredit that philosophy. Revolutions happen when the nobility choose to continually antagonize the inevitiable changes new technology forces on civilization, and force extras to fight Darth Blockbuster to move society forward.

To update our ruling philosophies faster, we need a roadmap for coming technology, and a way to quickly realize and adopt the new philosophies that new technologies need. Without a roadmap we can’t tell the good from the bad revolutions, or even when to expect them. Our ignorance means getting to the future through a series of surprising, and violent, revolutions. That’s a nasty road. Sadly, we leave it to poor music sheet copiers, brave priests, and obsessed scientists, to drive it alone; trying to tell civilization what they see coming before we hit a revolution. That’s why Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543) didn’t publish his seminal book about astronomy _On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres_ until laying on his death bed. Although he made a good mathematical argument why our planet revolved around the Sun, he was too scared of the nobility to present it. And he should have been. Copernicus’ book, and the newly made telescope that proved it correct, caused such a backlash, all following disruptions were called “revolutions” in its honor. Even today there are many who either don’t listen to scientific truths (ex. climate change), or violently reject proposed new ones (ex. sociobiology), all because we don’t understand how to question our ruling philosophy and even consider changing our civilization’s DNA.

Because we don’t master revolutions, we often punish our greatest protagonists. We jail Galileo, chase away Rousseau, and fight Thomas Jefferson. It’s the most powerful sign of how badly we understand our civilization and the philosophy that rules us. Once we understand the scientific, political, and industrial consequences of our technological development, we’ll understand the new DNA options our trailblazers show us, so we can choose the best, as we follow them on the road to adding even more phenomena to the realm of human understanding.

## The Nature of Techvolution

It wasn't until the telescope and microscope that we could master physics. And it wasn't until digital technology tha we could master revolutions. With it we can use the lessons of history, to make a roadmap of technological development, so we can anticipate the philosophical changes new technologies need. Digital technology is like a microscope looking down on human civilization, illuminating the road ahead of us in amazing detail.

Even the most basic details are enlightening: Consider the drivers who commit the worst crashes. What’s their characteristics? Who is responsible for training them? Who vouched for giving them a license? What about tracking who burns the most fossil fuels? Which mechanic shop does the best maintenance? Which the worst? Why? What laptops last the longest? What laptops are the cheapest to repair? What ethnic diets cause the worst heart disease? Who writes the software packages most downloaded on GitHub? With the world of digital technology, biometric sensors, big data, geo-trackers, hyper-links, solid-stage storage, block chain, machine learning, and so much more, we’ll be able to give our philosophies benchmarks, and realize when they should self-destruct and be re-created.

The resolution and magnification on civilization’s characteristics will only increase as digital technology gets better. Getting better details, with constant updates, enlightens us about technological changes in small increments rather than big sudden surprises. This way we’ll update our ruling philosophy incrementaly, and have pro-active provolutions, and not re-active revolutions, we’ll have _Techvolution_; all the benefits of technological modernization without the acrimony and bloodshed of revolutions. Soon our descendants won’t be able to understand revolutions any more than we can understand the Sun revolving around the Earth.

Techvolution will not remove violence, war, and bloodshed from the human species. It will make sure each faction can see itself and others with a microscope, so everyone knows their, and their opponents’ reason, and thereby lessen hatred and ease compromise. The French Revolution killed tens of thousands directly, and the resulting revolutionary and Napoleonic wars killed hundreds of thousands more. Europe was in flames because of a political revolution, that was rooted in the belief that God wanted “noble born” people to govern, not pay taxes, and live a life of banquets and balls. The nobility, who were to stupid to see a few years into their future, could not understand they weren’t gods, because they didn’t have the tools to see for themselves.

Better tools fight violence and promote reason. Copernicus, Galileo, and others also suffered because of a revolution, this one scientific, because they said the Earth revolved around the Sun. Contrary to popular opinion today, there was good scientific reason why people believed the opposite (mainly Aristotle and stellar parallax). The problem was because there was so little evidence of either being right, civilization needed politics to decide an answer to input into civilization's DNA. Hence why Galileo and others like Friar Bruno were either persecuted, jailed, and burned at the stake as heretics. As telescopes got better, they kept adding more data, proving the Earth moved, and soon political interference was removed, and science could take over.

Today scientists still disagree with each other. String theory, loop quantum gravity, general relativity, quantum mechanics, all have different answers to the same questions, and only one gets to be civilization’s official DNA answer written inside “Physics 101” textbooks and awarded Noble Prizes. So, scientists still battle greatly inside their fields. Some _hate_ each other. Yet they argue more over data, equations, and experiments, and less about opinions, intuitions, and inquisitions, because they have so many tools to test their theories and present evidence to each other in extreme detail.

Techvolution will use similar tools used in the natural world of physics, chemistry, and biology, into the human world, and thus we’ll stop using political fighting to decide what’s the best immigration policy, what’s the best tax rate, or decide when life starts. And if a people don’t use Techvolution, that’s okay. Like those who shun science today, they can stay befuddled, when scientists keep getting clearer looks at the truth.

There are revolutions, but you can't have techvolutions. Revolutions are the result of delayed human adaption to new technology. Techvolution is the continual adaption of society's ruling philosophy to new technology. Whether that's educated population empowered to participate in their own government, or changing scientific truth after looking through the telescope. Techvolution is continual adaption, and thus doesn't happen in bursts like revolutions. Like in nature there is only evolution, because it's entirely natural to keep adapting.

Revolutions are bloody messes. Nobody wins, least of all the nobility. Be they political, industrial, or scientific, revolutions should be avoided at all costs. Techvolution enable us to avoid revolutions while still arriving at a successful outcome.

Nobody needs one more than our civilization today.

- ever ask yourself why stories are so hard to make, why after 2000+ years, we stil suck at making them, because of abstraction.
- science put the plot about the characters, and now human science must do the same, care more about society than themselves.
