## Story-Cut Tools Summary

It would be nice if self-defence started with mixed-martial arts. Spending hundreds of years developing martial arts disciplines with techniques that proved ineffective seems like a waste. But starting off with mixed-martial arts wasn't possible.

We had to invent lots of options in order to select the best. It's only ignorant people who think great results don't require lots of wasted effort. Every products starts off with a terrible first try. Every great book has hundreds of erased pages.

To invent martial art techniques similarly need lots of wasted effort. You need the sport of boxing, with its rulebook and culture, to experiment different punching techniques. So while boxing excludes kicking and throwing, we wouldn't have the knowledge of excellent punching without those exclusions. Same applies to Judo and its bodythrows, jiu-jitsu and its submissions, and so on for every discipline. A limited rulebook fosters a few techniques. 

The problem mixed martial arts had to overcome wasn't the rulebooks of martial arts disciplines, but their proclamations about being the single source of truth.

Medicine had the same situation. 

Historically, in every culture in the world, medicine was a thing for healers who were masters of all. For example, the Roman healer Galen was the basis for European medicine from 5-1500. Among his teachings was the human body had four primary fluids, and illness is caused by an imbalance in these fluids. So, in Europe, if someone had a headache, ulcer, cancer, or most every any other ailment, a trained healer would often use leaches to drain blood from their patient to re-balance the fluids and heal them.

Laughable to us today, yet in a time of limited information and tools of the ancient world, not too surprising. Galen was an example of ab early discipline doing the best it could. Like the world round, Galen at least had people studying the body and looking for causes and solutions to diseases.

It therefore wasn't a huge jump to today's evidence based medicine when the printing press, medical tools, open minds like Leonardo Andreas Vesalius, William Harvey, and Florence Nightengale developed medicine into the many specialists we have today.

There are many healthy disciplines because every part of the human body has experts; throat, neck, toes, heart. You would today never go to one, expecting them to be a specialist of everything. All its professionals, from hemopathic healers to neural surgeons, are subdisciplines. Each has their own techniques, cultures, and rulebooks. Nobody should declare any of them the single source of truth. The skill in modern medicine is mixing them together to solve a patients pain. Modern medicine and mixed-martial arts are both achivements in being open-minded and letting the problem determine the best solution.

That is what this book is but for ideology.

There are lots of learn from old ideologies, but none of them are complete. They must be mixed and matched according to their strength and weaknesses, and evaluated based on evidence of their effectiveness on improving daily basis.

And this brings us back to storytelling and uncovering how echo chambers form. It's not possible to mix and match ideologies when one is stuck inside believing its a single source of truth. Storytelling is quite convincing, and so to let's learn about it to protect ourselves from its influence.

## Evolution

The evolutionary process of creating sub-disciplines first, and then selecting the best techniques is rational. It's the same process that empowered Life to go from single-cell organisms to stepping on the Moon. The problem holding us back from evolution was entirely us. While all other organisms on this planet are born wit their adaption and most make the best of it they can, we humans can learn, develop new techniques, and must therefore decide which to use and not use.

All martial art techniques are adaptions. In the natural world, evolution needs unfettered creation to decide what resulting adaptions are needed. Scientists call this choosing process "natural selection" and "survival of the fittest". We humans can't rely on nature doing this process for us. Our ability to reason means we can reject facts as much as we can receive them.

The fact we need to realize, is the philosophy's that we believe it must always serve practical ends.

The and that's because we don't realize technique, technology, adaptions is the highest in importance, and philosophy is the servant. Because we don't understand ideology we assume it's paramount. Philosphy must serve a practical purpose.
