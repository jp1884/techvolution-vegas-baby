# THE LESSON

Despite our problems with our own, society always needs a ruling philosophy. Darth Blockbuster fights to control it. When he does, he write rules to keep the tools he controls, and therefore himself, in power. Corporate manuals, univeristy guidelines, social justice blogs are among the pages of his Death Star rule book. These rules interfere with regular people majically forming bounds with new tools.

Maybe. Whose to know which rules are the bad ones. Maybe they're interfering with majic. Maybe they're just good rules. Darth Blockbuster hardly proclaims he wants to hurt humanity's evolution. So we need to clearly identify the difference between majic and rules, to know the difference.

This lessons takes us to small farm in Maryland, and a young boy who worked hard to better himself.

===

Our story is about a Maryland farm boy overcoming ignorance with tools. The farm is one of those classic farms you might have seen on shows like "Little House on the Prarire". Salt of the earth farmers raising crops and families in 19th century rural America. Wikipedia or Khan Academy or didn't exist. Not even many books either. So, you only knew about your own way of life.

The boy Frederick worked the fields with his mother. It was hard labour of course, there weren't many machines back in the 19th Century, but humanity is used to sweeting when cultivating the Earth. The boy worked hard, he wanted to keep his mother happy and fed. She wanted the same for her boy.

In a few years, the boy was sent to work with a relative in Baltimore. The house was large and the young family could use a hand around the house; cleaning, shopping, doing chores. It made his mother happy he wouldn't sweat so much, yet the boy was a farmer and unsure of the big city.

The father of the house was Hugh. He wasn't around much though. His new wife Sophia was. She was a foreigner used to colder climates, who didn't know many people yet, so she stayed in a lot. Sophia was nice and treated the boy nice too. Not as a farmer, but as a interesting person; not something farm hands were used to from rich people. She made Frederick feel at ease.

One day, Sophia handed Frederick a list of items to pick up from the store. Frederick's eyes looked down, his shoulders slouched, like a dog who disappointed its masters. Frederick mumbled "I can't read miss Sophia."

Sophia responded, "My God, well that won't do! Reading is good. How else can a person give and receive information from... from... the world! I'll teach you, we'll do it together." So Sophia taught Frederick to read. Just a few weeks, and he got the basics.

The world indeed! All those markings in the store, on street corners, in books, in newspapers, in the Holy Bible, they're each a new world! Go left, turn right, open, closed, discounted, welcome, and Salvation, all this stuff a door to a new world.

Frederick danced to the store, he whisked himself to do his chores, because he was learning more everyday. The world kept getting bigger, information kept pouring in.

One day Hugh came home early. He saw Sophia and Frederick reading at the dinner table.

Hugh walked into the room. "Boy, get out, and wait in the hallway. Face the wall."

Frederick got out, waited outside, and faced the wall. Seconds turned to minutes. Frederick rolled the newspaper in his hands tighter. He didn't want to go back to the farm. But even more, he didn't want his angel to get in trouble.

Inside the room, Sophia was curious "What is it? Everyone learns to read in Ohio"

Hugh responded "This isn't Ohio. He is a slave. What do you think happens when slaves reads. Do you think he won't start thinking."

Sophia's eyes went wide. "I didn't know the rules."

Hugh responded "Teach him."

As Frederick heard the hallway door open, he grips his newspaper.

Sophia said, in no angelic voice, "Turn around."

Frederick does, and looks at his angel, the one who talked with him like he was a person. And she looked back and only saw _her boy_.

Sophia slaped the newspaper from her boy's hand. He didn't let go. She slapped again, and again and again. Each slap hurt more than a dozen whips on his scarred back.

She slapped, and slapped, and slapped, and slapped. She will not do evil. She will not break the rules. Frederick's angel became a demon. Sophia was clicked by society's rules. Now she was a believer philosophy of racism to justify human slavery.

Frederick's world shut. The one white person ignorant enough to treat him like a person, was now an educated convert to the rules that put him into chains. Physical chains if needed, but evil prefers mental chains of ignorance; they stay on so much easier.

Weeks later Frederick was still in despair. His daily routine was the same. Yet, working under demonic masters is just different. He didn't dance to the store, he didn't whisk to do his chores, and he never saw Sophia smile again. Demons are always on guard.

One day, Frederick saw a newspaper, the avenue to knowledge whose path Fredereick was once on. He looked at the markings, saw some words he knew, and one word he didn't. Yet he still stared at it. Why?

The answer slapped him harder than the demon ever did, he read the words "The Freedom States in the North". He heard the word freedom before, but he didn't know freedom was a real place.

A shockwave went through him when he realized if slavery was a place, then so must freedom be a place too. Here Frederick realized he could break his own chains. Because ignorance was always his demon, and knowledge was always his angel. And he fought ignorance, and received knowledge, whenever he read.

So, Frederick taught himself to read. He practiced with ignorant white kids on the streets. He practiced reading items at the grocery store. He practiced on every street sign. And he practiced everytime he was at the Baltimore dock; the dock I said, you know the place, where ships will take you anywhere in the world. If you can read the schedule.

One day Sophia waited for her boy to return. But the boy died when the man Frederick Douglass walked onto the ship headed north to freedom. The man knew the exact time, place, and fare he needed to get on. He read it, himself, on the schedule. Reading opened the world to Frederick, and now the free world was opened to him.

The story gets better. Frederick Douglass becomes a brilliant orator and writer. In a world with no radio, video, or telephones, he travels the Northern States and Europe telling everyone the truth about slavery. When the American Civil War (1861-1865) broke out, his books help make Britain reject recognizing the South, and thus deprived it of a much needed support. The irony of a slave educating people about slavery, and thereby helping to end slavery is amazing to me.

Note innovation wasn't Douglass' problem. Using a tool was.

## Lessons

Frederick Douglass is a true Jedi Master. His bravery, intelligence, and persistence teach humanity's endless potential. The big lesson we need to learn here Skywalker, is the difference between rules and majic.

Sophia connected Douglass with books. She wasn't told to. She did it because we naturally love teaching tools. Whatever our joys are, from reading, knitting, or fishing, we love explaining them. We love it, because performing majic is even cooler than a magic show.

Contrast these two scenarios. When a magician makes a playing card disappear, we're awed because the magician made us wonder. However, when a majician connects someone with reading, they've similarly performed, not a trick; they've upgraded someone's cyborgology and effectively created a new and improved person.

Yet human made rules _sometimes_ say upgrading to a new tool is wrong. Peasant farmers couldn't have a musket, medieval parishoners couldn't read a science book, a 1990's kid couldn't download a digital song. Today millions of tired mothers can't telecommute. Why?

There is no easy answer. The Death Star of rules doesn't proclaim itself evil. The lesson Skywalker is it'll never be easy to know the difference between good and bad rules. There are millions of rules. Our best judge is majic. It naturally makes us smile. From teaching a kid to walk, to teaching a grandmother to use Skype and watch her grandkids first steps, teaching and learning new tools opens our hearts because it solves problems, and improves our way of life.

So, when teaching or learning a new tool, and someone steps in your way with a rule, ask yourself if you feel majic, and if you do, ask the rulemaker why he doesn't. Perhaps there's a good reason. But keep Sophia in mind. Performing majic made her fell good, while following the rules only made her feel safe.

Safety is fleeting Skywalker. No ruling philosophy lasts forever, thus all rules are set to expire. Majic never will. Look at poor Sophia. She gave one of our greatest writers and orators his start, yet she lived a miserable life watching him succeed because she believed she broke the rules. That should help you decide which rules are worth following. Expecially because only with majic, can we build our Lifestar.
