## What Happens Next

Comedians expose thought. They notice irrationalities and make us wonder about our unseen thought. Laughter is a reward for us seeing thought. Jokes inside one society may not be funny inside another because their thought is different therefore the irrationalities are different. However much we love to laugh we can't laugh on demand. Because we have to work to see a glimpse of thought. Thought is that powerful.

Realizations are also seen in comedy. In fact there's a good chance laughter exists because of realizations. The gift of consciousess means beings will understand good and bad fates. Thus to deal with the realizations of bad news, like the water supply is running out, the doctor used the wrong medication after a surgery, or the landing craft door is about to open on Normandy, laughter at the absurdity of life is the only some can to live with self-awareness.

## The Prince, and the Executive

This was the the executive. It will do for economics what the prince did for science and later on for politics. putting humans below the story, and letting the truth of the world as seen and sensed by tools, to determine our truths. human affairs, especially economic ones of what we make and use, needs the same transition as science, and democracy has today.

If it was called and presented that, you'd likely seen it through red and blue eyes. I hoped to showcase how the prince changed and belittled human thinking but that meant to empower it with science that has done more to improve humanity's progress than anything else in history.

I wish this book means humanity will never need another lesson. That's probably too idealistic. So hopefully this books will make it easier the next time human hubris gets in the way of heavenly progress.
