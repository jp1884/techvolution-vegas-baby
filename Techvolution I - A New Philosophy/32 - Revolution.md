# Revolution

Skywalker, you look tense. I get why. Revolutions are tough. Maybe we should get the bristol boards out, smear the face paint, and fight! Fight for free college education! Fight for less regulations! Fight for affordable health insurance! Fight for tax cuts! Let's go march and yell!

What color? See the trap there. You can't win. Whatever color you pick, you pick a hopeless fight. There is no answer for contemporary problems using old philosophies.

We're inspired by, but not repeatting, _Les Miserables_. Fighting for change doesn't mean to grab hold of the commanding heights of limited tools. We have digital tools. We can make endless products and apps to solve problems of each individual person.

We might have too choices actually. Windows or Mac? iPhone or Android? Tesla or Ford? Car or walking? Mail wedding invitations, or call and ask your friends to the party? Milk or rice milk? What shoes to buy. Which podcasts to listen to. Should you really skip university, and self-learn? Once you cut off the generic, old-school, suburban life of the "American Dream", there's a lot of choice. We have to filter the good from the bad.

We will. And we'll use Rousseau to do it.

## Ruling Philosophy

Rousseay said the nobility were con artists who hid behind divinity. Yet noble families ruled every European country. There had to be some reason for it, and there was. At first these families were declared holy by the people, because they were holy.

I'll tell a quick story to explain. It starts with the fall of Western Rome. Rome started as a republic in 753 BC and became a Empire in 27 BC. After several centuries of prosperity, the Roman Empire suffered years of civil wars, declining population, bloated civil administration, greedy military, lazy civilians, stupid emperors, relentless barbarian invasions, and the pacificying effects of Christianty, western Rome finally fell apart in 476. It was chaos. Society returned to zero. The water didn't run. The judges didn't rule. The military didn't defend. Almost like a zombie apocolypse movie.

No kidding. Vikings raided, Arabs invaded, Vandals roamed. This is when the Dark Ages (500 - 1000) started. Above all esle, the people needed security. Whoever stopped the zombies must surely be holy.

The former Roman province of Gaul was dead centre of chaos. Native Celts were pushed out by invading Frankish tribes, who added to the chaos by warring with each other. Eventually a winner prevailed. In 486 Clovis I (466-511), established a new kingdom. His dynasty ruled for centuries. Each new generation returned more law and order by militaryly protecting the Kingdom of France.

Churches and priests told the people to cherish their nobility as sent from God. It didn't take much convincing. Raids, invasions, and attacks were less and less. With peace came better farming, trade, and growth. The nobles divine right to rule was an idea the people supported. They could see the defeated invaders, and feel the full stomachs. Divinity was a reality.

The problem with the story of the nobles divine right to rule, wasn't the divinity of the original nobles. France's Kings after Louis I, like Charles Martel (688-741) and Charlemagne (742-814), all fought on many battlefields to protect their people, and made lawys to help them prosper. Of course they were protecting their taxpayers too. But that's the point. The leaders and the people had a symbiotic relationship.

And it worked. After Charlemagne, Europe left the Dark Ages and entered the High Middle Ages (1000 - 1300). This time wasn't all the bad to live in. Relative peace, security, and wealth not seen since the fall of Rome. We still celebrate it with "Medieval Times" and "Game of Thrones" stories.

The problem with the story, is the nobles divine right to rule didn't have a conclusion. As Europe travelled through the High Middle Ages, Late Middle Ages, Renaissance, Enlightenment, Europe kept getting more peaceful and richer.

All the wealth was going to the divine nobility. Now long removed from fighting Vikings or Vandals, these nobles told themselves they were divine because of their "noble blood". The nobility that Rousseau knew, didn't live in castles, wearing body armour of war heroes. They lived in opulant palaces and enjoyed endless banquets and balls. Cinderella wasn't even allowed in!

Here's a few paintings to showcase the change. One's of Charles Martel, and his people. The other of Louis XVI (1754-1793), and his people.

Opulance and wealth. They're like signs of a ruling philosophy gone on too long. It marked the impending end of Darth King. We need to understand why. And our answer is in mastering stories.
