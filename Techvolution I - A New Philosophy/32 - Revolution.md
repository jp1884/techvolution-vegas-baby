# Revolution

Skywalker, you look tense. I get why. Revolutions are tough. Maybe we should get the bristol boards out, smear the face paint, and fight! Fight for free college education! Fight for less regulations! Fight for affordable health insurance! Fight for tax cuts! Let's go march and yell!

What color? See the trap there. You can't win. Whatever color you pick, you're stuck. So I hope you realize by now there is no answer for contemporary problems using old philosophies.

Stop it Skywalker. This isn't _Les Miserables_. Fighting for change doesn't mean to grab hold of the commanding heights. We have digital tools. The struggle is getting them into the hands of the extras. All the aisles of products. Apps to download. Cars to purchase. Leaders to choose from. Policies to support.

All the millions of choices. All the connections we have in our society. From the majic of learning new tools, to the loyalty to old ones. All the loyalty, all the questions. We have to filter the good from the bad.

Let's use Rousseau again. He said the self described holy nobility were con artists. Noble families ruled every European country. Did they all get power by cons? No. At first these families were declared holy by their people.

I'll tell a quick story to explain. After years of civil wars, declining population, bloated civil administration, greedy military, lazy civilians, stupid emperors, relentless barbarian invasions, and the pacificying effects of Christianty, western Rome finally fell apart in 476. It was chaos. Society returned to zero. The water didn't run. The judges didn't rule. The military didn't defend. Almost like a zombie apocolypse.

Actually it was a raiding Viking, invading Arab, roaming Vandal apocolypse. The people needed security at the start of what we call the Dark Ages. As civilization slowly returned to western Europe, they got it.

For example in the Roman province of Gaul, the Frankish king Louis I, established a new kingdom. His dynasty ruled for centuries. Each new generation return law and order and military protection return to France.

The people were told by the leaders they were divine. Churches and priests told the people to cherish their nobility as sent from God. It didn't take much convincing when raids, invasions, and attacks were less and less. With peace comes better farming, trade, and growth.

The problem with the story of the nobles divine right to rule, wasn't the divinity of the original nobles. France's Kings after Louis I, like Charles Martel and Charlemagne, all fought on many battlefields to protect their people. Of course they were also protecting their taxpayers too. But that's the point. The leaders and the people had a symbiotic relationship. And it worked. After Charlemagne, Europe left the Dark Ages, and entered the High Middle Ages, which wasn't all the bad to live in. We still celebrate it with "Medieval Times" and "Game of Thrones" remembrances.

The problem with the story of the nobles divine right to rule was it didn't have a conclusion. As Europe travelled through the High Middle Ages, Late Middle Ages, Renaissance, Enlightenment, Europe kept getting more peaceful and richer, and richer, and richer.

All the wealth was controlled by the divine nobility. Now long removed from fighting Vikings or Vandals, these nobles were divine for the simple reason of being born with "noble blood". The nobility that Rousseau met didn't live in castles, wearing body armour of war heroes. They lived in opulant palaces and enjoyed endless banquets and balls. Cinderella wasn't even allowed in!

Here's a few paintings to showcase the change in the environment, and no change in the ruling philosphy. One's of Louis I in and his house. The other of Louis XVI and his house.

Similarly, on ruling philosophy as no conclusion built in. Thus, Skywalker we're doomed to the same fate. We have to master the human story, to help the extras participate in Techvolution.
