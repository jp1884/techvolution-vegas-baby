# Revolution

Skywalker, you look tense. I get why. Revolutions are tough. Maybe we should get the bristol boards out, smear the face paint, and fight! Fight for free college education! Fight for less regulations! Fight for affordable health insurance! Fight for tax cuts! Let's go march and yell!

What color? See the trap there. You can't win. Whatever color you pick, you pick a hopeless fight. There is no answer for contemporary problems using old philosophies.

We inspired by, but not repeatting, _Les Miserables_. Fighting for change doesn't mean to grab hold of the commanding heights. We have digital tools. We can make endless products and apps to solve our problems.

Too many actually. All the millions of choices. We have to filter the good from the bad.

Let's use Rousseau again. He said the nobility were con artists who hid behind divinity. Noble families ruled every European country. There had to be some reason for it. There was, at first these families were declared holy by the people.

I'll tell a quick story to explain. It starts with the fall of Western Rome. After years of civil wars, declining population, bloated civil administration, greedy military, lazy civilians, stupid emperors, relentless barbarian invasions, and the pacificying effects of Christianty, western Rome finally fell apart in 476. It was chaos. Society returned to zero. The water didn't run. The judges didn't rule. The military didn't defend. Almost like a zombie apocolypse.

No kidding. Vikings raided, Arabs invaded, Vandals roamed. This is when the Dark Ages (500 - 1000) started. Above all esle, the people needed security. Whoever stopped the zombies must surely be holy.

The former Roman province of Gaul was dead centre of chaos. Native Celts were pushed out by Frankish tribes, who added to the chaos by warring with each other. Eventually a winner prevailed. In 486 Clovis I (466-511), established a new kingdom. His dynasty ruled for centuries. Each new generation returned more law and order by militaryly protecting the kingdom of France.

Churches and priests told the people to cherish their nobility as sent from God. It didn't take much convincing. Raids, invasions, and attacks were less and less. With peace came better farming, trade, and growth. The nobles divine right to rule was a good idea.

The problem with the story of the nobles divine right to rule, wasn't the divinity of the original nobles. France's Kings after Louis I, like Charles Martel (688-741) and Charlemagne (742-814), all fought on many battlefields to protect their people. Of course they were protecting their taxpayers too. But that's the point. The leaders and the people had a symbiotic relationship.

And it worked. After Charlemagne, Europe left the Dark Ages and entered the High Middle Ages (1000 - 1300). This time wasn't all the bad to live in. Relative peace, security, and wealth not seen since the fall of Rome. We still celebrate it with "Medieval Times" and "Game of Thrones" stories.

The problem with the story of the nobles divine right to rule wasn it didn't have a conclusion. As Europe travelled through the High Middle Ages, Late Middle Ages, Renaissance, Enlightenment, Europe kept getting more peaceful and richer.

All the wealth was controlled by the divine nobility. Now long removed from fighting Vikings or Vandals, these nobles were divine for the simple reason of being born with "noble blood". The nobility that Rousseau met didn't live in castles, wearing body armour of war heroes. They lived in opulant palaces and enjoyed endless banquets and balls. Cinderella wasn't even allowed in!

Here's a few paintings to showcase the change in the environment and no change in the ruling philosphy. One's of Charles Martel, his house, and his people. The other of Louis XVI (1754-1793), his house and his people.

The Dark Ages ruling philosophy gave divinity to rulers who fought for it. Since humanity can't easily question our ruling philosophy, it kept going. Rulers were divine without reason. All because the story of nobles divine right to rule had no conclusion built it. All stories make the protagonist a hero for solving a problem. While he fights villians, heroes are rightfully considered divine by the extras routing for him.

However, in stories when the problem is overcome, the hero returns to being a regular person, and loses his divinity. Unfortunately, there wasn't a clause in the nobles divine right to rule to explain why these protagoinsts were divine (returning law and order), and thus there was no conclusion to the nobles divinity. Stuck inside their ruling philosophy, the nobles were protagonsits in their eyes, while being "Darth Kings" to history.

Similarly, on ruling philosophy as no conclusion built in. Ask any Darth Blockbuster you want, managing partnet at a consultanting firm, high priced lawyer, music executive, Professor of Distinguished Chair of Media Studies, when the problem that makes them an protagoinsts is overcome,so they can return to being a regular person. They won't even know what the fuck you're talking about. They're divine.

Thus, Skywalker we're doomed to the same fate. That's why we have to master the human story, to help the extras participate in Techvolution, and pick the real protagonists in the open source community.
