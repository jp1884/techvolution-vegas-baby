# Revolution

Skywalker, you look tense. I get why. Revolutions are tough. Maybe we should get the bristol boards out, smear the face paint, and fight! Fight for free college education! Fight for less regulations! Fight for affordable health insurance! Fight for tax cuts! Let's go march and yell!

What color do you want. See the trap there? You can't win. Whatever color you pick, you pick a hopeless fight. There is no answer for contemporary problems using old philosophies. I know it's easy and comfortable, but if you want that, cable news and their wise pundits are waiting.

We're inspired by, but not repeatting, _Les Miserables_. Fighting for change doesn't mean to grab hold of the commanding heights of limited tools. We have digital tools. We can make endless products and apps to solve problems of each individual person. Once we have Techvolution, the freedom to choose the best tools to solve our problems at home, work, and leisure.

We might have too choices actually. Windows or Mac? iPhone or Android? Tesla or Ford? Car or walking? Mailing wedding invitations, or call and ask your friends to the party? Milk or rice milk? What shoes to buy. Which podcasts to listen to. Should you really skip university, and self-learn? If the generic "American Dream" is bad, the specific one is daunting. We have to filter the good choices and tools, from the bad.

We will. And we'll use Rousseau to do it.

## Ruling Philosophy

Rousseau said the nobility were con artists. They who hid behind divinity to rule society for their self interest. Yet noble families ruled every European country. There had to be some reason for it, and there was. At first these families were declared holy by the people, because they were holy.

I'll tell a quick story to explain. It starts with the fall of Western Rome. Rome started as a republic in 753 BC, and became a Empire in 27 BC. After several centuries of prosperity, around 180, the Roman Empire started to suffer a general decline. Years of civil wars, declining population, bloated civil administration, greedy military, lazy civilians, stupid emperors, relentless barbarian invasions, and the pacificying effects of Christianty. Finally in 476 western Rome fell apart. It was chaos. Society returned to zero. The water didn't run. The judges didn't rule. The military didn't defend. Almost like a zombie apocolypse movie.

No kidding. Vikings raided, Arabs invaded, Vandals roamed. This is when the Dark Ages (500 - 1000) started. We call it the Dark Ages, because there is literally little record of anything. Few people wrote records, histories, manuscripts. Western Europe went "dark". In times of such anarchy, the people needed security above all else. Whoever stopped the zombies must surely be holy.

The former Roman province of Gaul was at the centre of chaos. Native Celts were pushed out to Wales, Scotland, and Ireland by invading Frankish tribes. These tribes who added to the chaos by warring with each other. Eventually however, a winner prevailed. In 486 Clovis I (466-511), established a new kingdom. His dynasty ruled for centuries. Each new generation returned more law and order, and military protection, to the Kingdom of France.

The kingdom was backed by the one remaining Roman institution, the Roman Catholic Church. The churhes priests told the people to cherish their nobility. Sermons told the people, the Bible says kings are God's chosen representatives. The people couldn't read, but it didn't take much convincing. Raids, invasions, and attacks were less and less. With peace came better farming, trade, and growth. The nobles divine right to rule was an idea the people supported. They could see the defeated invaders, and feel the full stomachs for themselves. Divinity was a logical reality.

The problem with the story of the nobles divine right to rule, wasn't the divinity of the original nobles. France's Kings after Clovis I, like Charles Martel (688-741) and Charlemagne (742-814), all fought on many battlefields to protect their people while making rules to help them prosper. Of course they were protecting their power and taxpayers too. But that's the point. The leaders and the people had a symbiotic relationship.

And it worked. Soon after Charlemagne, Europe left the Dark Ages and entered the High Middle Ages (1000 - 1300). This time wasn't all the bad to live in, with relative peace, security, and wealth not seen since Rome's peak. We still celebrate it with "Medieval Times" and "Game of Thrones" stories.

The problem with the story, is the nobles divine right to rule didn't have a conclusion. As Europe travelled through the High Middle Ages, Late Middle Ages, Renaissance, Enlightenment, Europe kept getting more peaceful and richer.

All the wealth was going to the divine nobility. Now long removed from fighting Vikings or Vandals, these nobles told themselves they were divine because of their "noble blood". The nobility that Rousseau knew, didn't live in castles, wearing body armour of war heroes. They lived in opulant palaces and enjoyed endless banquets and balls. Cinderella wasn't even allowed in!

Here's a few paintings to showcase the change. One's of Charles Martel, and his people. The other of Louis XVI (1754-1793), and his people.

Opulance and wealth. They're like signs of a ruling philosophy gone on too long. Early nobles wrote rules to encourage new tools forming majically connections with regular people and improving society for everyone. In the Middle Ages, peasant farmers were supposed to make tills to harvest more food, use screws to dig good wells, work iron to make lots of barrels.

However, as new tools kept getting more powerful, the nobles wrote rules to keep them away from the extras. Books, muskets, scientific instruments were all personally empowering. They were kept away from the people by dark majic. Tricks to prevent the people from connecting with new tools, to upgrade their cyborgology, and stay dependant on old tools.

Extras holding muskets died on countless battlefields wars for the nobles personal "glory". The Wars of Spanish Succession, Austrian Succession, Seven Years War, and more, all fought between countries that were no longer kingdoms trying to keep society together after Rome's collapse. But nation-states, with large bureaucracies, in which the nobility were merely executives, usually too distracted with court dramas and planning the next banquet.

The nobles used dark majic to trick the people into thinking wars, and banquets and balls were for everyone's benefit. Church sermons were sppken from spectularly built churches and cathedrals, while they kept saying God sent the nobles to rule. Priests on the frontline felt the pain of the people, yet bishops and cardinals not so much. Distanced from the frontline was the divider between those happy with the ruling philosophy, and those who wanted a new one.

Here's an example of the divide. Louis XIV made a program to let French peasants visit the Palace at Versailles. Tours were free, and only required a hat and coat (spares were available for rent). Louis wanted "his people" to see how glorious his kingdom was. He thought once the people saw entire rooms made of gold, and hallways of mirrors, they'd see how lucky they were to live in France. The irony that most peasants had never even looked into a mirror, and therefore had never even seen their own face, didn't occur to Louis.

The large divide between ruling philosophy, and frontline problems, marked the impending end of the nobles divine right to rule. It was a change seen in the change of early nobles castles and armour, used to defend their people, into palaces and dresses, used to enjoy a fun time at society's expense. Banquets and balls marked the impending end of Darth King. We need to understand exactly why to help forecast our problems. And our answer is in mastering stories.
