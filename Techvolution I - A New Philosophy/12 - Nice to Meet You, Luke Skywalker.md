# Nice to Meet You, Luke Skywalker

I'm being serious, you are literally the hero of this story. The one who will change the world.

It's not surprising. All heroes start as extras. Luke Skywalker worked on his farm, Neo typed at his cubicle, Cinderella cleaned the chateau. All regular people suffering under evil antagonists, until the story needed them to step up, take charge and win their, and everyone's, freedom.

So this is the cast of ideas and characters for the creation of Techvolution. It's a battle the protagonists are always fighting. To win it, the extras need join them. And that means you. Because regular people today are suffering under evil antagonists, and the story needs them all to step up, take charge and win their, and everyone's, freedom.

HOW DO YOU MAKE TECVOLUTION REAL. WHAT DOES IT MEAN IN REAL LIFE. HOW DO YOU DEFEAT DARTH BLOCKBUSTER.
