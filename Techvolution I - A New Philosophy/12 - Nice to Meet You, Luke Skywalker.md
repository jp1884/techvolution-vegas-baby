# Nice to Meet You, Luke Skywalker

Hi Luke. Hope your having a good day. A little about me first. I'm nobody special. In my youth I was a cleaner, drywaller, movie usher, and die-hard ideologue. After dropping that bad habit, I studied political philosophy at the University of Toronto. A nagging stutter made me too shy to leave frontine jobs. I'm (grudginly) grateful. I learned far more being a line worker, an account manager, a claims adjuster. I was one those co-workers you sometimes forget about because they just do their job. Happily living on the frontline taught me Techvolution.

So that's a snapshot. But it's not important. You are the hero. Because from car detailing to internet technical support, nursing to adjusting, only workers on the frontline know the tools our society needs to invent, keep, or throw away, to fix our many problems.

Don't worry about being a regular person. Average joes are always the heroes. Skywalker, Neo, and Cinderella. The list goes on. Each stepped up when called up to defeat the bad guys.

And our story is calling you now. That's why I wrote this book. Like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Morpheus, or the fairy godmother, I'm merely the guide, to teach you how to defeat the villians. So the time is now young Skywalker, to leave the farm, and join the rebellion.

What is the rebellion. It's definitely not rallies, marches or protests. It's a rebellion of the mind. We have to change our ruling philosophy. We have to erase Darth Blockbuster's rulebook, and write a new one every frontline person can refer to, when their at school or at work, fighting for Techvolution.
