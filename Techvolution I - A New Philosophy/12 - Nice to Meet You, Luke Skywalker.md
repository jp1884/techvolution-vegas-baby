# Nice to Meet You, Skywalker

And the story begins. Not in a foreign city, mythical world, or galaxy far far away. Right here and now, whereever you are on Earth, is where the story changes. Because you are the only one who can decide who should win, in the battle between protagonists and antagonists.

A little about me first. I'm nobody special. In my youth I was a cleaner, drywaller, movie usher, and die-hard ideologue. After dropping that bad habit, I studied political philosophy at the University of Toronto. I'm (grudginly) grateful a nagging stutter made me too shy to leave frontine jobs, because I learned far more about our politics and economics after graduation. It was working as a line worker, an account manager, a claims adjuster, making an app, and especially meeting my personal Darth Blockbuster, that taught me Techvolution.

So that's a snapshot. But I'm not too important. You are. Because from car detailing to internet technical support, nursing to adjusting, only workers on the frontline know the tools our society needs to invent, keep, or throw away, to fix our many problems.

So although you're an extra in battle between Jedi and Sith, you are the hero of Techvolution. Actually average joes are always the heroes. Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Neo, Cinderella. Each was a regular person like you, who stepped up to defeat the bad guys.

Like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Morpheus, or the fairy godmother, I'm merely the guide, to teach you how to defeat the villians. So the time is now young Skywalker, to leave the farm, and join the rebellion.

What is the rebellion. It's definitely not rallies, marches, or protests. It's a rebellion of the mind. We have to change our ruling philosophy, erase Darth Blockbuster's rulebook, and write a new one every frontline person can refer to, when their at school or at work, fighting for Techvolution.
