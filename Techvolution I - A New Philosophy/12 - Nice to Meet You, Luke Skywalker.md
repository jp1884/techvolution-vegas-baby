# Nice to Meet You, Luke Skywalker

Hi Luke. Hope your having a good day. A little about me first. I'm nobody special. In my youth I was a cleaner, drywaller, movie usher, and die-hard ideologue. After dropping that bad habit, I studied political philosophy at the University of Toronto, but learned far more continuing to work on the frontline as a line worker, an account manager, and a claims adjuster. A nagging stutter made me too shy to leave. I was one those co-workers you sometimes forget about because they just do their job. I'm grateful, because that's where I learned Techvolution.

So that's a snapshot. But it's not important, you are the hero. Because from car detailing, to internet technical support, only people on the frontline know the tools our society needs to invent, keep, or throw away, to fix our many problems.

Regular people are always the heroes. Skywalker, Neo, and Cinderella the list goes on. Each stepped up when called up to defeat the bad guys.

And our story is calling you now. That's why I wrote this book. Like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Morpheus, or the fairy godmother, I'm merel the guide. My job is to teach you how to defeat the villians. So the time is now young Skywalker, to leave the farm, and join the rebellion.

What is the rebellion. It's definitely not rallies, marches or protests. It's a rebellion of the mind. Together we have to erase Darth Blockbuster's rulebook, and write a new one every frontline worker can refer to, when their acting out Techvolution.
