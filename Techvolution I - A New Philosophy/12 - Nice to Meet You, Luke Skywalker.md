# Nice to Meet You, Skywalker

And the story begins. Not in a foreign city, mythical world, or galaxy far far away. Right here and now, whereever you are on Earth. Because you are the only one who can decide who should win, in the battle between old and new philosophies.

A little about me first. I'm nobody special. In my youth I was a cleaner, drywaller, movie usher, and die-hard ideologue. After dropping that bad habit, I studied political philosophy at the University of Toronto. I'm (grudginly) grateful a nagging stutter made me too shy to leave frontine after graduation, because I learned far more about our politics and economics continuing to work on the frontline. It was there as a line worker, an account manager, a claims adjuster, making an app, and especially meeting my personal Darth Blockbuster, that taught me Techvolution.

So that's a snapshot. But I'm not too important. You are. Because from car detailing to internet technical support, nursing to adjusting, only workers on the frontline know the tools our society needs to fix our many problems.

So although today you're an extra in battle between Jedi and Sith, you are the hero of Techvolution. Actually average joes are always the heroes. Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Neo, Cinderella. Each was a regular person like you, who stepped up to defeat the bad guys, when called up by the story.

Now you're called upon. Like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Morpheus, or the fairy godmother, I'm merely the guide, to teach you how to defeat the villians. So the time is now young Skywalker, to leave the farm, and join the rebellion.

What is the rebellion. It's definitely not rallies, marches, or protests. It's a rebellion of the mind. We have to change our ruling philosophy, erase Darth Blockbuster's rulebook, and write a new one every frontline person can refer to, when their at school, home, or work, fighting for Techvolution.
