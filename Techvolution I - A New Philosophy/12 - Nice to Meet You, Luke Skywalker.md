# Nice to Meet You, Luke Skywalker

I don't know you. Not personally anyway. You could be a book worm or a gear head. A cook or an mechanic. But if you're middle class, I know you pretty well.

I'm middle class. I was a cleaner, drywaller, a movie theater usher, a projectionist, a bunch of factories and warehouses, an account manager, a claims adjuster. I was happily one of those co-workers you sometimes forget about because they just do their job.

So I know today the middle class are extras, being overseen by Darth Blockbusters. To change the world, we have to skip the political rallies, and start solving problems on the frontline with the best tools possible. Millions of problems, solved not by presidents or executives, but by the person feeling the pain on the frontline.

That means you, and everyone, in the middle class are the heroes of Techvolution.

And that's poetic. All real heroes are regular people who rise to the occasion. Luke Skywalker, Neo, and Cinderella were regular people, suffering under evil antagonists, until the story needs them to step up, take charge and win their, and everyone's, freedom.

You are Luke Skywalker, Neo, and Cinderella. I'm merely Obi-Wan, Morpheus, and the fairy godmother. The one who will teach you how to use lightsabres, change the matrix, get into the ball. My success is your greatness. Techvolution is only made real through you.

So it's time to leave the farm young Skywalker, and join the rebellion.
