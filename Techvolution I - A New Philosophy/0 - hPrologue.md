# PROLOGUE

## Dedication

For my parents. For the work ethic you handed down to me. For caring so much when cleaning and building stuff for other people. For showing me who the protagonists are. It’s the best education a kid can get. I hope I learned enough.

For the antagonists, the self-entitled delegators keeping Blockbuster alive, thanks for making the past come to life. I hope you learn something.

To the extras. I pray you pick the right side.

## The Start

It all started with the forging of the great rings. No it didn't, I'm just using that as a start here. It all started with a door in the face. The one that made too many. It meant another failed sale for a product I believed in.

I knew it wasn't the price, there was no price. I knew it wasn't the competition. None of that either. And I knew it worked too, because I had done the frontline job it worked for.

I figured out how to save 100 million dollars, 30,000 hours of productivity, and dozens of lives with a product that cost 50 thousand a year to run. All I wanted was to give it away, so I could tell everyone how I did it. A "hook" for a nameless frontline worker's ideas about the bright future of our digital economy.

Yet doors in the face is what I got.

Because I wasn't at a door. I was at a gate. And the gatekeepers were doing their job. See they didn't say no to me or my product. They said it was against the rules to say yes.

I knew sales was hard, but I was breaking the rules? I wanted to "edit" Wikipedia, "commit"to  GitHub, "upload" to YouTube. These people all used these wonderful, free, services. But, the future stit opped with them because they found a rule. Yep, lots of rules inside layers of bureaucrats, managers, executives. All gatekeeping the future to keep their version of the DVD alive for companies pretending not to be Blockbuster.

This bullshit is happening throughout our civlization. Problems are pilig up, sucking the middle class dry. All because the gatekeepers hold our rule book.

So, before I, and anyone else, can let the bright future of our economy happen, we need to change. So you and I are going on a journey together through the creation of a new rule book, so gatekeepers can never say it's against the rules to help again.

## The Power Inside Stories

Do you love stories? I think it's a safe bet, who doesn't. Stories entertain us after hard days of work, bring us together to share our joys, and my favroite, open our minds to foreign cities, mythical worlds, and galaxies far far away.

Stories are so powerful because they're so simple. Heroes are good because they want to fix a problem. Villians are bad because they don't. Notice stories aren't debates about the problem. We take the heroes side. Thus, Romeo and Juliet's love is good, while their familes feud is stupid. Luke Skywalker's rebellion is good, and Darth Vader's empire is evil.

Moral clarity turns heroes into our friends, and villians into our enemies. We thus watch their story with strong emotions; which burst out at the climax, because we finally find out who wins.

Our hero fights hard at the final battle. But his superior morality, justice, and heroism isn't enough. He's often too small or unskilled, and the villian beats him bloody. On the verge of failure, the hero needs to find something, something that'll turn the tide. He searches, sees, and reaches for his salvation; a sword, gun, or lightsaber.

Will our hero reach it, or will our enemy? We hold our breadth because this reality, and most any story, is controlled not by desires, opinions, or philosophy, but by which character holds the tools.

It's a lesson we need to learn for ourselves.

## A New Empowering Philosophy Called Techvolution

Talk to any political junkie, no matter when, and they'll say there's a big election coming up, and that "if the red team wins, education, healthcare, immigration, everything will go to shit."

You buy it. So you watch blue cable news, read blue blogs, listen to blue talk radio. Soon enough, your face is painted blue, you're yelling, and waving that weapon of a bristol board at rallies, marches, and protests. You're fighting evil!

Let me ask you, if you ignored the election, how much would you bet, that you would know who won, just by living your life.

I mean today, when team blue wins, does traffic suddenly disappear? When team red wins, does everyone suddenly eat healthy?  Do you breath fresher air, or see healthier neighbors, when one color beats another?

If you think there's a difference, if you think the red vs blue story is an edge of your seat thriller, you can stop reading. There's lots of blogs and shows and books waiting to sing to their choir. If you don't like the choir, you'll probably like to keep reading. I wrote this book for you.

Here's why. Politics is a story, and an an election is the climax. And if we can't tell the difference, there's something wrong.

We care so much in _Romeo and Juliet_ and _Star Wars_, because either young love is embraced, or it dies. Either the rebellion is saved, or the rebels all die. These stories will live forever, because everyone appreciates what's at stake. There's nothing at stake in blue vs red, because they're not differenct enough.

Whoever wins, we still pay taxes, have a mortage, drive in traffic, don't sleep enough, buy the best food we can afford, watch climate change, pay too much for education, and hope a job we likely hate isn't downsized or outsourced. Under team blue or red, our lifestyle stays the same.

Because no political or economic philosophy today, from conservatism to progressivism, capitalism to marxism, is about putting new tools into your hands. Because they were each invented before we had many tools. Rubber shoes, indoor plumbing, electricity. They weren't even science fiction, that was invented after too. If you've used Netflix, Lyft, Skype, Kickstarter, GitHub, AirBnB, or Firefox you know how powerful our tools are now. Yet our lifestyle is not changing, because we use old philosophies.

Techvolution is a new philosphy about making regular people the hero of their own story. The difference you'll notice after you read this book is simple. You'll fight political battles not with bristol boards, but with the powerr of digital technology and tools in your hands, and thereby improve your own life.

## Mastering Our Tools With Techvolution

I want to empower you with tools. Yet, this is not a book about how to invent new tools. Amazing books like _Rework_, and _Zero to None_ already do that. Nor is it a book about the history of invention. _The Innovators_ does that better than I could dream. This is a book about how new tools empower society, and how we can distribute the power to improve the lives of regular people.

That means politics. Hence why we're making a new philosophy. Which we need because we're basically cyborgs who keep upgrading our tools, and digital tools are created very since. Once we update our philosophy, the smoother we'll evolve.

Note, I define political philosophy as the largley unspoken social rules that tells members of society what's right and wrong, good and bad. We're using stories to understand this rule book. Stories give its characters rules, goals, and definitions of good and bad. Philosophers are just storytellers for the real life story we all live in.

Now, I should say, I use _technology_ as a catchall term for things we make tools from, like concrete, lumber, nails, shingles, insulation, and bricks. I use _tool_ as a catchall term for things we create with technology to solve a problem, like guns to kill bad guys, books to learn, and houses to shelter in.

Upgrading a technology isn't a big deal. Sedan's and SUV's, tube televisons's and LCD's, are basically the same. But when we upgrade enough technologies, like microchips, touchscreens, batteries, and WiFi, we unlock a new tool, ala smartphones. And this is a big deal.

![The March of Technology](/img\prologue\techvolution-new-tool-creation-pc.png)

Because creating a new tool asks a climactic, political, question, who controls it? After all, whoever does, is more powerful. Thus, while civilization is a struggle to overcome problems by upgrading technology and inventing new tools, it's also a battle to control them. The people with the old tool usually want to retain their power, while inventors and innovators imagine a new society that shares it.

The eternal story of civilization is thus protagonists making new tools, antagonists attacking new tools, and many extras watching them fight. Our politics is an ongoing history of technological change, with inventor and gatekeeper both reaching for the tool, and fighting for the extras, to make themselves the winner.

Today the extras aren't self-aware of their power. I'll show you how important you are. Here's how you changed the world just by being curious.

## Extras Killed Wikipedia's Evil Twin

People always have some nagging question. Like why are movie theatres so lonely, or is a candy apple a real apple. Constant questions are a problem and we need a reference tool to solve it. True to ourselves, we make one with the technology available and upgrade it when possible.

Our first reference tools was the wisdom of elders. The first technological upgrades were papyrus and ink (500 BC) and books (500), which turned elders into experts like Hippocrates and Aristotle. When wood-pulp paper (1200) and printing press (1456) were invented, humanity unlocked mass produced books. Now experts could share knowledge and educate the masses. We called the reference books encyclopedias.

People loved encyclopedia's. For the first time many answers were available on demand. The Encyclopedia Britannica (1878) was the standard. It went into continuous publication (1933) to keep people updated to the latest facts. In the following decades, the computer, digital printer, and telecommunications meant encyclopedia's were written and stored digitally. But they stayed a set of books controlled by experts.

Then came the world wide web (1991), a new technology that unlocked many new tools like websites, forums, blogs, and something called "wikis". Wiki software lets anyone write or edit a webpage by pressing "edit now". All changes are saved, so anyone can erase errors or vandalism by pressing "undo now". For years programmers used wikis to collaboratively write technical manuals.

As web tools boomed in the late '90's, protagoinst Jimmy Wales wondered if the web could upgrade encyclopedias. Most of us curious about things like candy apples know the story ends with a free online encyclopedia anyone can edit called Wikipedia. But it didn't start out that way.

Wikipedia started as Nupedia (2000). Nupedia was a free online copycat of Encyclopedia Britannica where only “expert” professors made articles. Wikipedia (2001) was a side project. Only programmers knew "community content creation" would work.

Everyone else assumed regular people would only read professors. The first issue was the professors didn't like to share. In its first year Nupedia had 12 articles. Wikipedia had 40,000, which most professors loved to belittle as rubbish, disallowed students from referencing, and yet never improved, or assigned students to improve for everyone's benefit.

The second issue was it turned out "expert" answers, and answers, are the same. Candy apples are real apples popular in autumn festivals no matter who says it. And thirdly, most importantly, Wikipedia turned many extras into protagonists! A huge community of non-academics voluntarily shared their knowledge one "edit now" at a time, and fiercely protected their common knowledge with the lightsaber of "undo now".

And lastly, so many of the remaining extra's flocked to Wikipedia. It answered so many questions on demand, the extras support quickly made Wikipedia king, while giving Nupedia and Encyclopedia Britannica quick deaths.

That's the story Wikipedia. Made by new protagoinsts, made the standard reference tool by empowered extras. Few believed it was possible, because even professors don't understand new tools always unpower the few, to empower the rest.

![New Tools Mean New Powers](/img\prologue\techvolution-enclyclopedia-book-wiki.png)

## An All To Uncommon Story

Lots of other new tools had the same antagonism as Wikipedia. When AT&T controlled America's phone lines in the 1960's-1980's, it impeded the internet every chance it got. In 1979 Xerox gave upstart Apple the designs for the modern personal computer because the photocopier was the future of office work. In 2008 Blockbuster laughed at Netflix because HD-DVD and Blu-Ray were the future of movies. iTunes, Uber, AirBnB, Tesla all had similar stories.

The truth most new tools are defeated. They never activate the extras. Look at some of our problems today, like rampant unpaid overtime, not sleeping enough, incomprehensible tax codes, expensive formal education, endless road traffic, technological these are all easy to solve, yet the exist.

Because gatekeepers don't feel the pain of inaction, otherwise they'd open the gates. The pain is felt in the frontline. That means our political situation is looks like a series of problems being felt on the frontline, that antagonists try to repress. It looks something like this. That also means, while there's lots of hooting and hollaring, politics is actually about the distributing, or gatekeeping, the power of new tools in society.

![New Tools Mean New Powers](/img\prologue\techvolution-pain-receptors.png)

## Climatic Fights For Distribution

Fighting to spread the power of new tools is an archetypal human story. Galileo fought a religious establisment with a telescope, George Washington fought a political establishment with a musket, and Steve Jobs fought a economic establishment with an iPod. Florence Nightingale, Nikola Tesla, Robert Noyce, Marc Andressen, Reed Hastings, Peter Thiel, Elon Musk are other heroic examples.

And that's the story I want to empower all the extras to join with lightsaber's a blazin', dicing up old tools like the evil storm stroopers they are, to smooth out humanity's natural evolution. It's vital to realize the story is about problems and tools, not people. So while professors were antagonists to a better reference tool, many of Wikipedia's facts were discovered by professors, so they're hardly pure villians.

Our lives cut across thousands to millions of problems. Thus, our villians are not in a massive group like "the rich" or the "the unions" as old philosophies label. Instead we have "micro-villians" inside millions of organizations, withholding new tools, so they can keep their version of DVD's alive.

Historically their cautionary tales. In real time, they're villians holding society back. Ones I call Darth Blockbuster. They are the enemy of this book.

## Finding Darth Blockbuster

Darth Blockbuster appears every time someone defends a bad tool. This could be inside a company, institution, country, or civilization. His action delays upgrading society. Problems pile up, causing strikes, bankruptcies, civil wars, and revolutions. Darth Blockbuster is either misguided, or a selfish asshole. Either way he causes the delays in upgrading society, and thus encourages political and economic hatred instead of cooperation.

But finding him is hard. Nobody thinks they're an antagonsist. Even Darth Vader thought he was a hero!

So how does Darth Blockbuster hide from us, and himself, so well? Let's read a story filled with heroes, villians, and extras fighting over technology. It's a few pages, but it's worth it. For one its a great story, and two, you'll learn where Darth Blockbuster's secret hideout is.

## The Boy Frederick

Our story is about a Maryland farm boy overcoming ignorance. The farm is one of those classic farms you might you'll see everytime you watch "Little House on the Prarire". Salt of the earth farmers raising crops and families in 19th century rural America. Definitely no Wikipedia or Khan Academy to log into. Not even many books either.

The boy Frederick worked the fields with his mother. It was hard labour of course, there weren't many machines back in the 19th Century, but humanity is used to sweeting when cultivating the Earth. The boy worked hard, he wanted to keep his mother happy and fed. She wanted the same for her boy.

In a few years, the boy was sent to work with a relative in Baltimore. The house was large and the young family could use a hand around the house; cleaning, shopping, doing chores. It made his mother happy he wouldn't sweat so much, yet the boy was a farmer and unsure of the big city.

The father of the house was Hugh. He wasn't around much though. His new wife Sophia was. She was a foreigner used to colder climates, who didn't know many people yet, so she stayed in a lot. Sophia was nice and treated the boy nice too. Not as a farmer, but as a interesting person; not something farm hands were used to from rich people. She made Frederick feel at ease.

One day, Sophia handed Frederick a list of items to pick up from the store. Frederick's eyes looked down, his shoulders slouched, like a dog who disappointed its masters. Frederick mumbled "I can't read miss Sophia."

Sophia responded, "My God, well that won't do! Reading is good. How else can a person give and receive information from... from... the world! I'll teach you, we'll do it together." So Sophia taught Frederick to read. Just a few weeks, and he got the basics.

The world indeed! All those markings in the store, on street corners, in books, in newspapers, in the Holy Bible, they're each a new world! Go left, turn right, open, closed, discounted, welcome, and Salvation, all this stuff a door to a new world.

Frederick danced to the store, he whisked himself to do his chores, because he was learning more everyday. The world kept getting bigger, information kept pouring in.

One day Hugh came home early. He saw Sophia and Frederick reading at the dinner table.

Hugh walked into the room. "Boy, get out, and wait in the hallway. Face the wall."

Frederick got out, waited outside, and faced the wall. Seconds turned to minutes. Frederick rolled the newspaper in his hands tighter. He didn't want to go back to the farm. But even more, he didn't want his angel to get in trouble.

Inside the room, Sophia was curious "What is it? Everyone learns to read in Ohio"

Hugh responded "This isn't Ohio. He is a slave. What do you think happens when slaves reads. Do you think he won't start thinking."

Sophia's eyes went wide. "I didn't know the rules."

Hugh responded "Teach him."

As Frederick heard the hallway door open, he grips his newspaper.

Sophia said, in no angelic voice, "Turn around."

Frederick does, and looks at his angel, the one who talked with him like he was a person. And she looked back and only saw _her boy_.

Sophia slaped the newspaper from her boy's hand. He didn't let go. She slapped again, and again and again. Each slap hurt more than a dozen whips on his scarred back.

She slapped, and slapped, and slapped, and slapped. She will not do evil. She will not break the rules. Frederick's angel became a demon. Sophia was clicked by society's rules. Now she was a believer philosophy of racism to justify human slavery.

Frederick's world shut. The one white person ignorant enough to treat him like a person, was now an educated convert to the rules that put him into chains. Physical chains if needed, but evil prefers mental chains of ignorance; they stay on so much easier.

Weeks later Frederick was still in despair. His daily routine was the same. Yet, working under demonic masters is just different. He didn't dance to the store, he didn't whisk to do his chores, and he never saw Sophia smile again. Demons are always on guard.

One day, Frederick saw a newspaper, the avenue to knowledge whose path Fredereick was once on. He looked at the markings, saw some words he knew, and one word he didn't. Yet he still stared at it. Why?

The answer slapped him harder than the demon ever did, he read the words "The Freedom States in the North". He heard the word freedom before, but he didn't know freedom was a real place.

A shockwave went through him when he realized if slavery was a place, then so must freedom be a place too. Here Frederick realized he could break his own chains. Because ignorance was always his demon, and knowledge was always his angel. And he fought ignorance, and received knowledge, whenever he read.

So, Frederick taught himself to read. He practiced with ignorant white kids on the streets. He practiced reading items at the grocery store. He practiced on every street sign. And he practiced everytime he was at the Baltimore dock; the dock I said, you know the place, where ships will take you anywhere in the world. If you can read the schedule.

One day Sophia waited for her boy to return. But the boy died when the man Frederick Douglass walked onto the ship headed north to freedom. The man knew the exact time, place, and fare he needed to get on. He read it, himself, on the schedule. Reading opened the world to Frederick, and now the free world was opened to him.

The story gets better. Frederick Douglass becomes a brilliant orator and writer. In a world with no radio, video, or telephones, he travels the Northern States and Europe telling everyone the truth about slavery. When the American Civil War (1861-1865) broke out, his books help make Britain reject recognizing the South, and thus deprived it of a much needed support. The irony of a slave educating people about slavery, and thereby helping to end slavery is amazing to me.

That's probably my favourite story. There is much more inside the book _A Narative of the Life of Frederick Douglass_, but the essense is all there. It would make a great movie. But the book is always better and it's been around since 1845. So, give it a read. It's free on the internet too. How fitting.

## Darth Blockbuster's Secret Hideout

That's probably my favourite story. There is much more inside the book _A Narative of the Life of Frederick Douglass_, but the essense is all there. It would make a great movie. But the book is always better and it's been around since 1845. So, give it a read. It's free on the internet too. How fitting.

Let's get back to our story. Of course Douglas was the hero, Hugh the antagonist, and Sophia the extra. I used their story to add another important element to our list, philosophy. Notice how Sophia wasn't a bad person by nature, but when she changed her tools, she had to change her philosophy. Like we control a tool, its philosophy controls us. Even when it makes us evil.

Because we are cyborgs who keep changing our tools, and philosophy is how we connect with them. Guns, sports cars, airplanes, books, wikis, DVD's, online streaming, each have a philosophy to form a connection with their users. Use a tool, depend on a tool, and its philosophy warps your world with definitions of good and bad, like it did for Douglass, Hugh, and Sophia.

Here's the super-important realization. Once a new tool does arrive, the old tool only has its philosophy left to fight back with. And here is where Darth Blockbuster hides.

Thus, attacking Darth Blockbuster isn't a technical battle, it's a philosophical one. But it takes time to write the philosophy for new tools. And extras on the frontline like Sophia follow established philosophies until a new philosophy steals them away.

That's why I wrote Techvolution. Because we already have the tools of the future. Yet inventors of digital tools struggle because they don't have a philosophy to tell the extras why open-source programming on GitHub, local manufacturing with 3D printing, maker controlled content on Vimeo and podcasts, managerless work on Lyft, Uber, AirBnB, and privacy protection on Firefox, should be their protagonists.

Techvolution is that philosophy. It's the philosophy for new and powerful digital tools to fight Darth Blockbuster for the love of society's extras.

## Raiding Darth Blockbuster's Secret Hideout

Despite holding super powerful tools like bio-monitors, artifical intelligence, virtual reality, 3D printing, high-speed internet, bitcoin, advanced encryption, in your hands, heck I should say our hands, feel powerless.

We pass the time by fiddling with our phones. Checking email, Twitter feeds, WhatsApp messages with cramped necks and bored minds. But we the people aren't addicted to our shiny new tools. We're holding lightsabers, learning their basics, waiting for a new philosophy to turn them on.

Here it is. Here's the goal of Techvolution.

- Understand how we create new tools.
- Understand how we should distribute new tools in society.
- Kill Darth Blockbuster.

If I do this, I can say I made a new philosophy. But it'll be up to the extra's to pick a new one over the many old ones.

They should. We can dismantle Darth Blockbuster, while making a new philosophy so he'll never come back. I know this because our battle with today's Darth Blockbuster was fought generations ago with his master, Darth King.

Darth King lived inside castles and palaces. His absolute power hidden inside an old philosophy of the "noble's divine right to rule". Slowly, as protagonists invented scientific instruments, books, and guns, new ideas formed into a new philosophy. A philosophy of science, enlightenment, equality, and democracy made real when the protagonists and extras fought as one in the American and French Revolutions. These revolutions are our guide to kill Darth Blockbuster for good. They were inspired by the new ideas of Jean-Jacques Rousseau.
