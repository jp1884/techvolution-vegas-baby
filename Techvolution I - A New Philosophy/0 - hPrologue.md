# PROLOGUE

## Dedication

For the open source community. For the unspoken philosophy you handed down to me. For caring so much when updating Wikipedia or building cool new tech for people. For showing me who the protagonists are. It’s the best education a political guy can get. I hope I learned enough.

For the antagonists, the self-entitled delegators keeping Blockbuster alive, thanks for making the past come to life. I hope you learn something.

To the extras. I pray you pick the right side.

## The Start

It all started with a door in the face. The one that taught the lesson. I was selling a product they were never going to buy, because they could not buy it.

Before you wonder, it wasn't the price, there was no price. It wasn't the competition. None of that either. And I can promise it worked, because I had done the frontline job it worked for.

I figured out how to solve a problem, and save 100 million dollars, 30,000 hours of productivity, and even several lives, with an app that was virtually free. All I wanted was to give it away to help get attention to a economic theory book I wrote, about the untapped possibilities of new tech like apps, bio-monitors, and bitcoin. I wanted real-world proof to prove my point.

After this last door I realized the biggest roadblock to the future was our technology. I wasn't even knocking on doors, but gates. See, I wasn't talking to the frontline workers suffering through the problem I solved, but bureaucrats, lawyers, managers, and executives, who insisted they take a look at my new tool first. Meaning I had to knock on their gates. These gatekeepers existed because of problems. Solving any was asking them to fire themselves.

That's why they never said no to me. No needs a reason. Instead they said it was against the rules to say yes. Obscure ones hidden inside regulations and contracts. They believed in these rules, especially the one about asking the front-line workers to decide for themselves.

I'm not going to talk about my experience too much. All that's important is there was a problem, a big one wasting millions of your dollars, weeks of workers time (lots of it unpaid), and maybe even your life, and it was against the rules to solve it.

## The Power Of Stories

Do you love stories? I think it's a safe bet. Who doesn't? They entertain us after hard days of work, bring us together to share our joys, and my favroite, open our minds to the different ways of life inside foreign cities, mythical worlds, and galaxies far far away.

Stories are so powerful because they're so simple. Protagonists are good because they want to fix a problem. Antagonists are bad because they don't. Notice stories aren't debates. We take the protagonists side. Thus, Romeo and Juliet's love is beautiful and worth dying for, while their familes feud is ignorant and evil. Luke Skywalker's rebellion is good and just, while Darth Vader's empire is wicked and evil.

Moral clarity about a problem turns protagonists into our heroes, and antagonists into our villians. We thus watch their story with strong emotions, which burst out at the climax, where we find out who wins.

Our hero fights hard, but his superior morality, justice, and heroism isn't enough. He's often too weak or unskilled, and the villian beats him bloody. On the verge of failure, the hero needs to find something, something that'll turn the tide. He searches, sees, and reaches for his salvation; a sword, gun, or lightsaber.

Will our hero reach it, or will our enemy? We in the audience, like extras in the story, hold our breadth because this reality, and most any story, is controlled not by desires, opinions, or rules, but by which character holds the tools. It's a lesson we need to learn for ourselves.

## A New Empowering Philosophy Called Techvolution

The rules. We think they control us. They don't. I'll show you.

Talk to any political junkie, no matter when, and they'll say there's a big election coming up. They'll say something like "if the red team wins this one, education, healthcare, infrastructure, everything will go to shit." What he means is elections decide the rule makers, and red rules are evil while blue rules are good.

If you buy it, most of us all have at some time, you watch blue cable news, read blue blogs, listen to blue talk radio. You fill your emotions with blue's philosophy for making good rules. Soon enough, your face is painted blue, your waving a blue bristol board while yelling blue chants at rallies, marches, and protests. You feel amazing, fighting evil red philosophy!

This is where I show you by asking a question. If your a regular middle class person, and you ignored the election, how much would you bet, that you would know who won, just by living your life.

I mean today, when team blue wins, does traffic suddenly disappear? When team red wins, does everyone suddenly eat healthy? Do you breath fresher air, or see healthier neighbors, i.e. do your real life problems get solved, when one color's philosophy writes the rules?

If you think yes, if you think the red vs blue story is an edge of your seat thriller deciding the future of our society, you can stop reading. There's lots of blogs, shows, and books waiting to sing to their choir, telling you to fight the enemy until your blue in the face.

If you don't like the choir, or you curious why middle class problems aren't being solved, and starting to wonder if blaming the other color is only a recipe for stagnation, you'll probably like to keep reading. I wrote this book for you.

Whichever color wins an election today and writes the rules, regular people still pay taxes, have a mortage, drive in traffic, don't sleep enough, buy unhealthy food, watch climate change, over pay for questionable education, get abused by customers, work unpaid overtime, are micro-managed, and hope a job we likely hate isn't downsized or outsourced. Under blue or red rules, our lifestyle stays the same, because the tools in which we live our lives, like suburban homes, gas cars, call centres, paper based tax forms, mass produced unhealthy food, television for entertainment, education industry, and everything else in suburban America, stays the same.

The rules, no matter what color, don't control us. Tools do.

Nothing changes between red and blue, because neither's philosophy, from conservatism to progressivism, capitalism to marxism, is about putting new tools into our hands.

It's no there fault. All of them were invented before we had many tools. Rubber shoes, indoor plumbing, and electricity weren't invented. Horse and carriages, ships of sail, moon as a nightlite were common tools when red and blue were born.

Red and blue philosphies were invented to help humanity industrialize and build the first rudimentary tools of gas cars, black and white televisions, and computers the size of rooms. The masses needed to be extras, regulated, and managed inside massive color coded parties that spanned across our entire society because tools were limited, thus they could't be shared.

This is not the world we live in today. Digital tools are so easy to make we can customize them for every person's individual problems. Netflix, Lyft, Skype, WhatsApp, 3D printing, bio-monitors, air quality sensors, GPS trackers, Kickstarter, smart watches, GitHub, AirBnB, or Firefox are amazingly powerful new tools. Yet they're held back by the rules of old philosophies. We need a new philosophy.

Techvolution is a new philosphy about making regular people the hero of their own story. Using it, unlike me, you won't be knocking at the gate of Blockbuster, asking if its okay to distribute YouTube to the people.

With Techvolution, you'll fight political battles not with bristol boards or painted faces, but with the power of digital technology and tools in your hands, so you can improve your own life by solving your problems with no gatekeepers in the way.

People often say we're addicted to our phones. We aren't. We getting to know them. They are our lightsabres. We've just been waiting for a new philosophy to turn them on.

## Mastering Our Tools With Techvolution

I want to empower you with tools. Yet, this is not a book about how to invent tools. Amazing books like _Rework_, and _Zero to One_ already do that. Nor is it a book about the history of invention. _The Innovators_ does that better than I could dream. If you want a brilliant critique of our society, _The Incerto_ and _The Great Degeneration_ are already waiting for you. Instead, this is a book about how new tools empower society, and how we can distribute their power to improve the lives of regular people today.

That means changing the rules of our society with a new philosophy. Todays philosophies don't mix well with modern technology. They consider the middle class as extras. People to watch the story. Even if we watch our problems pile up at home and at work, we're not supposed to solve them until we pass the gatekeepers of old tools in government bureaucracies, creeky corporations, lawyers officers, or consultants meetings. All versions of Blockbuster writing rules to protect themselves in an era of YouTube and Netflix. We need a new philosophy.

We start in nature. Notice gatekeeper's don't exist in nature. Evolution doesn't have anyone telling a cheetah she's running too fast, that the ants are too cooperative, or a camel is too water efficient. Lifeforms adapt as best they can to their own problems and the winners survive. No middleman, no gatekeepers, just problem solvers.

Yet human biological adaptions have stopped. We'll never evolve to fly, remember everything we need to know, or breath Martian air. Humanity continues lifes evolution with tools. We're basically cyborgs who adapt and solve problems by upgrading our transportation, memory, and breathing tools.

However, our problem solving is held back by old philosophies that empower gatekeepers. People in control of old tools like Blockbuster, getting to decide when, and if, humanity will upgrade our tools. I actually don't like the term gatekeepers. Some gates are good. I call today's antagonists to our technological evolution Darth Blockbuster. People who prevent human evolution for their self-interest.

We call biological upgrades and adaptions evolution. I call human technological evolution _Techvolution_. This book is about inventing techvolution, a philosophy to re-write the rules of society, to forever kill Darth Blockbuster, so regular people can solve our problems with technological upgrades as smoothly in human society, as evolution does in nature.

## Definitions

Here we need to take a break. I want to layout the philosophy our clearly, so I'll I define the ideas we all need to know:

Philosophy: the largley unspoken ideals that tells members of society what's right and wrong, good and bad, in science, art, morals, politics and economics. A collective consciouness that makes up a civilizations DNA, used by members to make rules around questions like: what is scientific truth? Who should govern? And how should resources be organized?

Ruling philospophy: is a civilization's chosen philosophy. One that all factions agree on. Like the "Divine Rights of Kings" derived from Christian theology used in royalist Europe.

Technology: a catchall term for things we make tools from, like concrete, lumber, nails, shingles, insulation, and bricks.

Tool: a catchall term for things we create with technology to solve a problem, like guns to kill bad guys, books to learn, and houses to shelter in.

Civilization story: The invention of new technology and creation of new tools to overcome whatever problem troubles us. We use tools to evolve.

Protagonists: people who selflessly invent, spread, and use new technology and make new tools. Usually close to the problems on the frontline of business and average life, they individually struggle, but their continued self-sacrifice slowly improves life on Earth. We call their leaders trailblazers who often skirt the rules ex. Nikola Tesla, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk.

Antagonists: people who selfishly resist new tools to defend their wealth, power, and prestige. Antagonists often manage companies or institutions based on dated technologies and think working on the frontline is beneath them. They hide behind rules which they work to control. We don't often identify them. I invented "Darth Blockbuster" so we can.

Extras: everybody in the middle of a battle between two tools. Because they have no direct interest in either side, they can pick winners and losers. Usually extras are in the middle class; not so poor as to be desperate, but not so powerful they want to keep the world the same. Sadly, extras don't realize their power.

Techvolution: a new philosophy empowering seemless human technological evolution by ridding Darth Blockbuster of his power, by empowering extras to decide when society should upgrade to new tools.

## Short Story

So humanity evolves with tools. Some people help, others hurt. Here's how it happens.

Upgrading a technology isn't a big deal. Sedan's and SUV's, tube televisons's and LCD's, are basically the same. But when we upgrade enough technologies, like microchips, touchscreens, batteries, and WiFi, we unlock a new tool, ala smartphones. And this is a big deal.

![The March of Technology](/img\prologue\techvolution-new-tool-creation-pc.png)

Because creating a new tool asks a climactic, political, question, who controls it? After all, whoever does, is more powerful. Thus, while civilization is a struggle to overcome problems by upgrading technology and inventing new tools, it's also a battle to control them. The people with the old tool usually want to retain their power, while inventors and innovators imagine a new society that shares it.

The eternal story of civilization is thus protagonists making new tools, antagonists attacking new tools, and many extras watching them fight. Our politics is an ongoing history of technological change, with inventor and gatekeeper both reaching for the tool to make themselves the winner. Extras are left to decide between the dreamy world of protagonists, and the established rules of antagonists.

Today the extras are not self-aware of their power to decide the winner. I'll show you how important you are. Here's how you changed the world just by being curious.

## Extras Killed Wikipedia's Evil Twin

People always have some nagging question. Like why are movie theatres so expensive, or is a candy apple a real apple. Constant questions are a problem and we need a reference tool to solve it. True to ourselves, we make one with the technology available and upgrade it when possible.

Our first reference tools was the wisdom of elders. The first technological upgrades were papyrus and ink (500 BC) and books (500), which turned elders into experts like Hippocrates and Aristotle. When wood-pulp paper (1200) and printing press (1456) were invented, humanity unlocked mass produced books. Now experts could share knowledge and educate the masses. We called the reference books encyclopedias.

People loved encyclopedia's. For the first time many answers were available on demand. The Encyclopedia Britannica (1878) was the standard. It went into continuous publication (1933) to keep people updated to the latest facts. In the following decades, the computer, digital printer, and telecommunications meant encyclopedia's were written and stored digitally. But they stayed a set of books controlled by experts.

Then came the world wide web (1991), a new technology that unlocked many new tools like websites, forums, blogs, and something called "wikis". Wiki software lets anyone write or edit a webpage by pressing "edit now". All changes are saved, so anyone can erase errors or vandalism by pressing "undo now". For years programmers used wikis to collaboratively write technical manuals.

As web tools boomed in the late '90's, protagoinst Jimmy Wales wondered if the web could upgrade encyclopedias. Most of us curious about things like candy apples know the story ends with a free online encyclopedia anyone can edit called Wikipedia. But it didn't start out that way.

Wikipedia started as Nupedia (2000). Nupedia was a free online copycat of Encyclopedia Britannica where only “expert” professors made articles. Wikipedia (2001) was a side project. Only programmers knew "community content creation" would work.

Everyone else assumed regular people would only read professors. The first issue was the professors didn't like to share. In its first year Nupedia had 12 articles. Wikipedia had 40,000, which most professors loved to belittle as rubbish, disallowed students from referencing, and yet never improved, or assigned students to improve for everyone's benefit.

The second issue was it turned out "expert" answers, and answers, are the same. Candy apples are real apples popular in autumn festivals no matter who says it. And thirdly, most importantly, Wikipedia turned many extras into protagonists! A huge community of non-academics voluntarily shared their knowledge one "edit now" at a time, and fiercely protected their common knowledge with the lightsaber of "undo now".

And lastly, so many of the remaining extra's flocked to Wikipedia. It answered so many questions on demand, the extras support quickly made Wikipedia king, while giving Nupedia and Encyclopedia Britannica quick deaths.

That's the story Wikipedia. Made by new protagoinsts, made the standard reference tool by empowered extras. Few believed it was possible, because even professors don't understand new tools always unpower the few, to empower the rest.

## Climatic Fights For Distribution

Fighting to spread the power of new tools is an archetypal human story. Galileo fought a religious establisment with a telescope, George Washington fought a political establishment with a musket, and Steve Jobs fought a economic establishment with an iPod. Today millions of developers, designers, coders, and thinkers invent new tools in GitHub, StackOverflow, Sketch, inside labs, universiries, and institutions like Mozilla.

And that's the story I want to empower all the extras to join with lightsaber's a blazin', dicing up old tools like the evil storm stroopers they are, to smooth out humanity's natural evolution. It's vital to realize the story is about problems and tools, not people. So while professors were antagonists to a better reference tool, many of Wikipedia's facts were discovered by professors, so they're hardly pure villians.

Our lives cut across thousands to millions of problems. Thus, our villians are not in a massive group like "the rich" or the "the unions" as old philosophies label. Instead we have "micro-villians" inside thousands of companies, institutions, and organizations, withholding new tools, so they can keep their version of DVD's alive. Darth Blockbuster is either misguided, or a selfish asshole. Either way he's got to go.

I'll show the protagonists how to fight better, and explain to the extra's why they are the power brokers in our society. What apps they use, what new tools they fund, what rules they should follow.

The extras can kill Darth Blockbuster. I know this because our battle today was fought generations ago with his Darth Blockbuster's master, Darth King.

Darth King lived inside castles and palaces. His absolute power hidden inside an old philosophy of the "noble's divine right to rule". Slowly, as protagonists invented scientific instruments, books, and guns, a new philosophy was born. A philosophy of science, enlightenment, equality, and democracy made real when the protagonists and extras fought as one in the American and French Revolutions. These revolutions are our guide to kill Darth Blockbuster for good. They were inspired by the new philosophy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau.
