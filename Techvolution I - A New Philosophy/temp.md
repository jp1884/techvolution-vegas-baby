TECHVOLUTION
Introducing A New Philosophy To Understand The Human Condition

## What is the book about

In October 1917, several hundred Russians stormed a palace in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Their leader was Vladimir Lenin, who had advocated for a Communist revolution for many years. Finally, his followers were storming one of the homes of Tsar Nicholas II, a person who most of the country still believed was sent from God to rule over Russia. The communist revolutionaries disagreed. They thought religion was a trick, Tsars were corrupt rulers, and now that devoted communists were running things, heaven would soon come to Earth.

Communism is a political and economic philosophy. It has a vision of a better world and a list of instructions for people to follow to make this imagined reality come true. 

Everyone follows a philosophy. It's easier to see how powerful philosophy is when looking at foreign countries and their changeover from one philosophy to the next. Every society will have devoted believers who read philosophy books, debate minute details, and fight if needed. However, even people who don't know philosophy must still live in society and, therefore, must follow the rules and conventions inspired by society's dominant philosophy. Just imagine the identity shift a Russian farmer had when, one day, a divine King was in charge, and then the next day an atheist communist dictator called the shots.

Today, in America and the West at large, our politics is in crisis. Our ideologies, Conservatism and Progressivism, are at each other's throats. Although they share much in common, believers in both camps are forming ranks to fight each other instead of finding ways to compromise. Increasingly, each side dreams of being like the revolutionaries in Saint Petersburg, storming the government office to take power and institute their hallowed ideologies.

There is a reason why Conservatives and Progressives are fighting (and why they will keep fighting), just as there was a reason society followed divine kings and eventually fought for many revolutions to replace those kings. The reason is that human civilization has a story driving it: the story of technological evolution. Sadly, we've always been characters inside this story who don't understand the plot.

So, I wrote Techvolution. This book is about a new political and economic philosophy with a brand new vision for the world. It's custom-made to solve or improve current problems at work, in government, at school, and in society at large. It doesn't need violent revolutions or violence to do this. Instead, it draws back the curtain and explains the story of civilization's technological evolution so we can master it.

Techvolution does all this because it's the first philosophy with an original but rather simple insight. Humanity is not a biological species. We haven't been for many centuries. And with each passing invention, we leave the biological kingdom of Life further behind. Technology is increasing how we gather resources, protect ourselves from the elements, defend ourselves from danger, and many other things.

The book's thesis is that in order to have consistent technological evolution, our society needs a new dominant philosophy that instructs people on how to facilitate technological evolution. I call this new philosophy Techvolution. By embracing technological evolution, we can finally understand the politics and economics and the rules and conventions we need to harness technological evolution. By facilitating evolution, we can finally give everyone a better chance at a happy life.

Sadly, the better world of Techvolution isn't as simple as storming a palace. But you can place one brick on the road to prosperity by reading this book. Once you do, you'll stop being an unaware character inside the story of civilization and instead become a hero of evolution inside it.

Sure, here is a bullet point summary of what your book is about:

## What does this book argue?

This book argues that technological evolution has always been the plot behind civilization. However, we don't realize this truth. Instead, much like how we once thought Earth was the center of the universe or God chose individuals to be divine leaders, we see civilization in a person-centric way. We falsely think civilization will rise and fall based on what ideology we believe in or what our identities are.

We are trapped inside the stories, ideologies, and philosophies of our own creation, be it capitalism, conservatism, socialism, or progressivism. These belief systems help us organize society and give regular people the rules and conventions they need to live daily life. However, ideological storytelling also traps us into believing they are all-powerful and will solve all our problems. And it's never worked out that way.

That's why one day, people will believe their leader was sent from God to rule as an absolute monarch, to a few weeks later, thinking that a communist dictator should rule because he's read the communist manifesto. This constant change of philosophies causes revolutions, counter-revolutions, and general fighting over whose philosophy will rule society. Thus, our civilization's technological evolution advances in fits and jumps and is prone to failure and collapse.

This book argues that ideologies have good and bad features, and we must pick and choose them as required. To have the freedom of mind to mix and match ideologies, we need the power to escape storytelling. We do this the same way we escape the stories that once limited our understanding of physics, astronomy, biology, medicine, and evolution. We escape from our stories by realizing the definition of good and bad is not relative to our stories but to our ability to follow the rules of evolution to foster the technological evolution that is truly driving our civilization forward.

Harnessing technological evolution means understanding what evolution is, how it fights entropy to stay alive, and how we must adapt it to facilitate our ongoing technological evolution. Some of the pillars of evolution we must adapt to our technological evolution are Natural Selection, Ecosystems, Genetic Variation, Adaptation, Speciation, Units of Selection, and Co-evolution.

When past ideologies have proven successful, it's because they happened to champion these pillars. Be it conservatism, which protects property to let it grow in a market economy where the individual is the one selecting what property they need, or progressivism, which recognizes that the government must sometimes re-distribute property so more people will participate in the economy and diversify the kinds of products in an ecosystem.

Finally, this book argues that only by using technological evolution as the benchmark can humans judge the success and failure of their ideologies and beliefs before civilization suffers revolutions or failures. Once we hold ourselves accountable to the rules of evolution, will our civilization evolve smoothly like we often dream in our visions for the future.

In summary, here are the key points of Techvolutions' arguments:

1. The book argues that technological evolution, not human-centric ideologies or philosophies, has been the driving force behind the progression of civilization.

2. The book contends that we are trapped within the stories, beliefs, and ideological frameworks of our own creation, which causes constant upheaval and revolutions as competing philosophies vie for dominance.

3. The book proposes that to truly harness and facilitate technological evolution, we need to escape the constraints of ideological storytelling and instead ground our understanding of politics and economics in the fundamental principles of evolution itself.

4. The book argues that by aligning our political, economic, and social frameworks with the "pillars of evolution" like natural selection, adaptation, and co-evolution, we can enable a smoother, more sustainable technological progress that benefits all of society.

Natural Selection: This is the fundamental mechanism of evolution, where individuals with favorable traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on those traits to the next generation. Natural selection acts on the variation present within a population.

Genetic Variation: Evolution requires genetic variation within a population. This variation arises through random mutations, genetic recombination during sexual reproduction, and other processes. Variation provides the raw material for natural selection to act upon.

Adaptation: Organisms evolve adaptations - traits that enhance an individual's ability to survive and reproduce in its environment. Adaptations arise through the process of natural selection favoring beneficial variations.

Speciation: Over time, populations can diverge and form new species through mechanisms like geographic isolation, reproductive isolation, and the accumulation of genetic differences.

Units of Selection: The level at which natural selection acts is debated, but can include the individual organism, the gene, the group, or even the ecosystem. The relative importance of these different units of selection is an active area of research.

Sexual Selection: This is a form of natural selection where certain traits are favored because they increase an individual's reproductive success, often through mate choice (e.g. female choice) or intrasexual competition.

Co-evolution: Species can evolve in response to the evolution of other species, leading to intricate relationships and "arms races" between predators and prey, parasites and hosts, and mutualistic partners.

Evo-Devo: The field of evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) examines how changes in developmental processes can lead to the evolution of new morphological features and body plans.

Our New Leviathan
Opening your eyes to the fact evolution now sees us as a technological species. And that's a big deal.


ESCAPING IDEOLOGY
Unmasking the Storytelling of Our Belief Systems

Across the Western world, the ideological divide between left and right is deepening as each side surrounds itself in a self-reinforcing echo chamber of news, books, and podcasts. The resulting heroization of insiders and vilification of outsiders has driven neighbors, friends, and countrymen to the brink of hatred.

But as people commit to an ideology, few know what an ideology actually is, where does it come from, and why does it wield such power over us. Ideology, this book showcases, is a particular kind of story - one deliberately crafted to compel an entire society to unite and solve problems. But this huge purpose makes ideology hard to escape from. And we need the ability to escape ideologies; because once its founding problems are solved, ideologues do not yet have the self-awarness to move onto new problems and new ideologies.

Once we see through ideology, we begin to see how civilizations have risen and fallen not on the basis of ideological dogma, but on their ability to evolve technological solutions. By freeing ourselves from the constraints of rigid belief systems, we open the door to selectively "mixing and matching" different ideological elements - a pragmatic path to continued problem-solving, and therefore seamless societal and technological evolution.

10 CUPS A DAY
The history of how we drink and how it shows our transition from animal kingdom to technological species.

EVOLUTION'S NEW THIRST
Our Transition From Animal Kingdom To Technological Species.

Cooking food fueled the evolution of human brains, enabling us to create, communicate, and ultimately leave the animal kingdom behind inside civilizations. Yet we are not fully free of our primal roots.

Our belief systems, ideologies, and philosophies are often viewed as the driving forces behind societal success or failure, evidenced by the growing hatred between conservatives and progressives today. But evolution operates by different rules - it cannot comprehend our human languages and belief systems. To truly transcend our animal origins, we must recognize that evolution sees us first and foremost by how we collect and store resources. To evolution we are a technological species.

Tracing how civilizations developed the means to hydrate their populations - from animal skins to indoor plumbing - reveals patterns of ascent and decline mirroring the evolutionary principles governing all life. Only by grounding our politics, economics, and social structures in these fundamental evolutionary dynamics can we hope to navigate a smoother path forward for human civilization.

RECLAIMING THE SUNLIGHT
How the Youth Can Bring Living Costs Down and Save Their Future

Trapped in the shadow of their elders, today's youth face a bleak reality - shut out from stable jobs, retirement savings, and home ownership, the financial sunlight they need to thrive has been denied them. But this crisis is nothing new. Throughout history, many similar cost of living woes have plagued the youth. Usually social upheaval soon follows.

Now, RECLAIMING THE SUNLIGHT offers the younger generation a chance to learn from the past and seize control of their destinies. By examining how previous generations navigated rising cost of living, the book uncovers concrete strategies the youth can employ to not only break free but prosper. The key is to cast aside contemporary deologies and harness modern technology to build a new society that works for them.

Drawing inspiration from the reforms of Julius Caesar to the innovations of early America, the book shows how the youth, by banding together and harnessing innovation, can use 21st century tools to dramatically lower their living costs. In doing so, they'll finally reclaim the sunlight needed to build the prosperous future that has too long been out of reach.

TECHVOLUTION
Introducing A New Philosophy To Understand The Human Condition

Techvolution presents a groundbreaking new philosophy that challenges the dominant ideological frameworks driving politics and economics in modern society. The book argues that technological evolution, not human-centric belief systems has been the true driving force behind the progression of human civilization.

The author contends that we have become trapped within the narratives and stories of our own ideological creation. These belief systems provide the rules and conventions for organizing society, but also lead to constant upheaval as competing philosophies vie for dominance, causing revolutions, counter-revolutions, and societal failures.

To escape this cycle, Techvolution proposes that we must ground our understanding of politics, economics, and social structures in the fundamental principles of evolution itself. By aligning our frameworks with the "pillars of evolution" - concepts like natural selection, adaptation, and co-evolution - the book argues we can harness technological progress in a more sustainable and equitable manner.

The central thesis is that only by using technological evolution as the benchmark, rather than ideological storytelling, can we accurately judge the success or failure of our beliefs and enable a smoother, more stable path of advancement for human civilization. The book challenges readers to rethink the role of ideology and instead focus on the underlying drivers of technological change as the key to shaping a better future.

Techvolution is intended to be of interest to a wide audience, from students of political science, economics, and sociology, to policymakers, business leaders, and anyone concerned with the future trajectory of human society in the face of rapid technological transformation.

Techvolution presents a groundbreaking new philosophy that challenges the dominant ideological frameworks driving politics, economics, and social structures in modern society. The book argues that the deep ideological divides plaguing the Western world are symptomatic of a deeper issue - our tendency to become trapped within the narratives and stories of our own belief systems.

Techvolution contends that ideologies are a particular type of compelling story, deliberately crafted to unite an entire society around solving specific problems. However, once those founding problems are solved, ideologies often struggle to adapt, leading to cycles of upheaval as competing belief systems struggle to stay alive past their lifespans.

To break free from this cycle, the book proposes that we must shift our focus away from human-centric ideologies and instead ground our understanding in the fundamental principles of technological evolution. The author argues that from an evolutionary perspective, we are no longer merely an animal species, but a technological one - our success is defined by how we collect and store resources, not by the specific belief systems we espouse.

By aligning our political, economic, and social frameworks with the core dynamics of technological evolution, such as natural selection, adaptation, and co-evolution, Techvolution suggests we can enable a smoother, more sustainable path of progress. This pragmatic "mixing and matching" of ideological elements, can help us navigate challenges and secure a brighter future.

Particularly relevant for the younger generation, Techvolution offers a roadmap for harnessing modern technology and innovation to dramatically lower living costs and reclaim the financial "sunlight" needed to thrive. By casting aside rigid ideologies and embracing the evolutionary nature of technological progress, the book empowers readers to take control of their destinies.

Techvolution is intended to be of interest to a wide audience, from students of political science, economics, and sociology, to policymakers, business leaders, and anyone concerned with the future trajectory of human civilization in the face of rapid technological transformation.
