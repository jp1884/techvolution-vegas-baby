# PROLOGUE

## Dedication

For the open source community. For the unspoken philosophy you handed down to me. For caring so unconditionally when updating Wikipedia, writing free software, and building cool new tech for us all. For showing me who the protagonists are. It’s the best education a political guy can get. I hope I learned enough.

For the antagonists, the self-entitled delegators keeping Blockbuster alive, thanks for causing history to repeat itself yet again. I hope you learn something.

To the extras. When it’s time for you to act, I pray you pick the right side.

## The Beginning

It all started with a door in the face. I few more actually. I'm either too stubborn or too hopeful. Either way, I eventually learned my lesson. I was selling a product upper management were never going to buy.

Before you wonder, it wasn't the price, there was no price. It wasn't the competition. None of that either. And I can promise it worked, because I had done the frontline job it worked for.

I figured out how to solve a problem—and save 100 million dollars, 300,000 hours of productivity, and even several lives—with an app that was virtually free. All I wanted was to give it away. After years of working on political and economic theory, I’ve written (another) book about the untapped possibilities of new tech like apps, bio-monitors, and bitcoin. I wanted real-world proof, and maybe get some real-world credentials, to help validate my ideas.

But I was a fool. I wasn’t even knocking on doors. I was knocking on gates. See, I wasn’t talking to the frontline workers suffering through the problem I solved, but the bureaucrats, lawyers, managers, and executives, who were paid to “deal” with those problems. Solving their problems was asking them to fire themselves. The gates were in place to shut out innovation.

In fact, they never said _no_ to me. _No_ needs a reason. Instead, they said it was against the rules to say yes. Obscure rules, hidden inside regulations and contracts. They believed in these rules, especially the one against letting frontline workers to decide for themselves.

I'm not going to talk about my experience too much. All that's important is there was a problem, a big one wasting millions of your dollars, weeks of workers time (lots of it unpaid overtime), and maybe even your life, and it was against the rules to solve it.

## The Power Of Stories

Do you love stories? I think it’s a safe bet to say that you do. Who doesn’t? They entertain us after a hard day of work, bring us together to share our joys, and (my favorite) open our minds to the different rules and philosophies of foreign cities, mythical worlds, and galaxies far far away.

Stories are so powerful because they’re so simple. Protagonists are good because they want to fix a problem. Antagonists are bad because they don’t. Stories aren’t debates. We take the protagonist’s side. Thus, Romeo and Juliet’s love is beautiful and worth dying for, while their families’ feud is ignorant and stupid. Luke Skywalker’s rebellion is good and worth fighting for, while Darth Vader’s empire is wicked and deserves to be destroyed.

Our moral clarity about a problem turns the protagonists into our heroes and the antagonists into our villians. We thus follow their story with strong emotions, which burst out at the climax, where we find out who wins.

Our hero fights hard to defeat the story’s problem, but his superior morality, justice, and heroism isn’t enough. He’s often too weak or unskilled, and the villian beats him bloody. On the verge of failure, the hero needs to find something, something that’ll turn the tide. He searches, sees, and reaches for his salvation: a tool or a weapon—whether it’s a gun, magic book, or lightsaber.

Will our hero reach it first, or will the enemy? We in the audience, like extras in the story, hold our breath because the story’s society is controlled not by desires, opinions, or rules, but by which character holds the tools. The wielder is the victor. The victor writes the rules. It’s a lesson we need to learn for ourselves.

## A New Empowering Philosophy Called Techvolution

The rules. We think they control us. They don’t. And I’ll show you why.

Talk to any political junkie, no matter when, and they’ll say there’s a big election coming up. They’ll say something like “if the red team wins this one, then education, healthcare, infrastructure, and everything else will go to shit.” What he means is elections decide the rule makers, and that blue rules are good while red rules are evil.

If you buy it—and most of us have at some point—you watch blue cable news, read blue blogs, listen to blue talk radio. You fill your head with blue’s philosophy. Soon enough, your face is painted blue, you’re waving a blue bristol board while yelling blue chants at rallies, marches, and protests. You feel like a hero! You’re fighting against the evil red philosophy!

Let me ask you, if you’re a regular middle-class person, and you ignored the election, how much would you bet, that you would know who won, just by living your life.

I mean today, when team blue wins, does traffic suddenly disappear? When team red wins, does everyone suddenly eat healthy? Do you breathe fresher air, or see healthier neighbors, i.e. do your real-life problems get solved, when one color’s philosophy writes the rules?

If you think yes, if you think the red vs blue story is an edge of your seat thriller deciding the future of our society, you can stop reading. There’s lots of blogs, shows, and books waiting to sing to their choir, telling you to fight the enemy until you’re blue in the face.

If you don’t like the choir, or you’re starting to wonder if blaming the other color is a convenient excuse for both red and blue to distract from middle class stagnation, you’d probably like to keep reading. I wrote this book for you.

Whichever color wins an election today and re-writes the rules, regular people will still pay taxes, have a mortage, drive in traffic, under sleep, buy unhealthy food, watch climate change, overpay for questionable education, fail to understand their health insurance, get abused by unhappy customers, work unpaid overtime, are ignorant of their own health records, remain micro-managed, and hope their job (which they likely hate) isn’t downsized or outsourced.

Under blue or red rules, our lifestyle stays the same, because the tools in which we live our lives, like suburban homes, gas cars, call centres, centralized power generation, paper based tax forms, mass produced unhealthy food, occasional doctor check ups, television for entertainment, an insatible education industry, and everything else in suburban America and Canada, stays the same.

The rules, no matter what color, don’t control us. The tools we live our life with do. And nothing changes between red and blue, because neither’s philosophy—from conservatism to progressivism, capitalism to Marxism—is about putting new tools into our hands.

It’s not our politicians fault. The philosophies they follow were invented before we had many tools. Horses and carriages, ships pushed by wind, the moon as a nightlite, were common tools when red and blue were born. Think of it; their philosophical fathers like Adam Smith, Edmund Burke, John Stuart Mill, Karl Marx, never listened to music, watched a lecture, read an eBook, had a psycological evalution, knew dinosaurs existed, made a phone call, knew the Earth wasn't 5,000 years old, learned about evolution, opened a fridge, saw a television, had a genetic test, santized their wounds, used penicillin, knew about electricity, started a motor, or typed on a keyboard.

Red and blue philosphies were invented to group society into a massive collection action. With red and blue philosophies we came together, industrialized, and built the first rudimentary tools like steam engines, toilets, gas cars, black and white televisions, and computers the size of rooms. The masses needed to be extras, regulated and managed inside massive color coded parties because our tools were few, and couldn’t be shared with everyone. To their credit, blue and red philosophies at least gave extras a voice in how our tools’ factories, regulations, and profits were controlled.

Yet today with live in a world far far away from limited tools. Digital tools are so easy to make that we can customize them for every person’s individual problems. Heart rate monitors, Skype, Lyft, WhatsApp, 3D printing, genetic tests, air quality sensors, GPS trackers, Kickstarter, YouTube, Khan Academy, smart watches, finger-print scanners, thermal cameras, GitHub, AirBnB, and Firefox are amazingly powerful new tools that are so easy to make, we don’t need to fight to control them, but fight to spread them. This doesn’t come naturally to us, however, because the rules of old philosophies are based on fighting over, not sharing, tools.

Techvolution is a new philosphy about making regular people the hero of their own story. It does so by empowering them with new tools.

With Techvolution, you won’t fight political battles with bristol boards or painted faces. You’ll economically exercise your right to vote, by deciding which tools best solve your problem at home and work. Unlike me, you’ll never need to deal with any gatekeepers, because you won’t have to knock at anyone’s door asking permission to do what’s best for you.

I’m not talking about an idealic world from storytime. This place of sharing tools already exists. Wikipedia, YouTube, StackOverflow, GitHub, Linux, Mozilla are only a few examples of the wonderful world of cooperation. It’s called the open-source community because software and ideas are “openly shared” to help create new tools. Millions of creators and contributors, designers and coders, who don't care about titles or status but only how well a person solves problems, are already working and living inside a fundamentally new story that’s responsible for our online world. I only want to rid our society of old philosophies holding it back, to let these protagonists prosper.

People often say we’re addicted to our phones. We aren’t. Checking news feeds, downloading ping-pong games, taking endless photos, is regular people learning what our new tools can do. Our ancestors did the same when printed books, cheap muskets, and telescope, empowered them to read, fight tyrants, and see the universe for themselves. We toy with new tools before we use them to change the world.

We're not addicted to our phones. We're learning to use our new lightsaber. We'll use them to destroy the gatekeepers of old tools. Once a new philosophy turns them on. That’s Techvolution.
