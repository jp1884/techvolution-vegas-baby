# ROUSSEAU'S EXTRAS

## Freeing Cinderella

“Extras are born free; and everywhere they are in chains.” That’s paraphrasing Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who wrote that in 1762. Was Rosseau the King of France? He wasn’t. Was her richest man in England? Absolutely not. Rousseau was a poor writer who copied sheets of music to make the rent. More than 300 years later, he is recognized as being a great philosopher, a political visionary, and a protagonist who helped free the world with his new philosophy.

Rousseau lived when kings and queens, dukes and duchesses ruled civilization. A time when Mozart played inside exquisite palaces during the nobility’s many banquets and balls. This was the image of opulence that had Cinderella dreaming her days away as she cleaned a dirty chateau. Sadly, unlike the the fairy tale, the extras didn’t have a fairy Godmother to make their dreams come true. Instead, the commoners cleaned the noble’s vast libraries, used guns while dying in their wars, and wondered what it looked like through a telescope. The extras were excluded from the power of new tools because they believed their beloved Holy Bible said only noble people had the “divine right to rule”.

Rousseau called bullshit. In truth, Jesus was a carpenter, a commoner just like any other extra—you could argue—who rose above the masses and became the ultimate protagonist. Who is to say that other extras can’t live up to their own potential? Rousseay said books, guns, and scientific instruments should liberate the extras who were only in chains for the happiness of con artists. The self-proclaimed “divine nobility” didn’t like hearing that. This powerful self-protecting community of Darth Kings declared Rousseau a banquet-pooper, and chased him out of Switzerland, France, and England. Maybe that’s why Rousseau rented instead of owned.

Starting in 1776, within Rousseau’s lifetime, Darth King started to face the music when the American people started a revolution. One year after he died, the French had their own revolution in 1789. And on it went from country to country because Rousseau, and others like him, make the extras realize they should become protagonists in a civilization “of the people, for the people, by the people”. Cinderella soon forgot about the fancy ball, and instead played the music of freedom, in a choir of equals that sounded something like this:

>Do you hear the people sing?
Singing a song of angry men?
It is the music of a people
Who will not be slaves again
When the beating of your heart
Echo’s the beating of the drums
There is a life about to start
When tomorrow comes!

Revolutionary songs like this spread the people’s liberty, equality, and fraternity throughout the world. In a few years, civilization changed its philosphy from knowing the nobles were divine, to knowing they were villians. When the people took control of books, guns, and science, they put presidents and senators, judges and sherriffs in power, who ruled at the request of new protagonists who built a civilization with checks and balances, because no one was divine. A change empowered by tools, thought of in philosophy, yet made real with the bloodshed of revolutions.

Rousseau died never having found a home. After they won their revolutions, a population of heroes put him to rest inside the glorious Panthéon, heralding him as a renowned breaker of chains, in a free world he helped build. Where any guy can be the prince, and any girl can be Cinderella.

The question for us is, how did Rousseau do it?

## The Road to Techvolution, and the Death of Revolutions

The easy answer is he made people realized they lived on the frontline today, and the ruling philosophy was from the past. See, even though the people didn't have telescopes, guns, or books, society did. Thus the people were continually disadvantaged. It's like a student at University today. He can use Wikipedia to find an answer, but still isn't allowed to reference it in term-paper. So he spends hours searching through books instead. The same thing applies to internet music and movies, each was introduced by supposed pirates.

Likewise, even though French and Americans could read up on current events, they still couldn't vote. Even though they could use muskters to defend their own land, they were fighting wars to expand the king's glory instead. Rousseau made the people realize this was bullshit.

This change started a revolution, a sudden questioning of a civilization’s ruling philosophy. The American, French and all the others in the 19th centuries were so violent, because the divide between ruling philosophy, and frontline society, was so wide.

It's a lesson for us, as we start this Techvolution, to hurry up. Because the longer we wait to update our ruling philosophy to to digital tools, the more out of touch the frontline and ruling philosophy gets. The result is revolution. All the more reason for a Techvolution.
