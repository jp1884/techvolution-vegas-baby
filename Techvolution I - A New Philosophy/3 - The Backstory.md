# CHAPTER TWO - THE BACKSTORY

## Your Backstory

After 18 years of war, the American Revolution was finally over. The divine British nobility swallowed their pride, admitted they lost, and met their once colonial subjects in France to sign the Treaty of Paris in 1783. Still, the British were too proud to sit for the official painting with the "commoner" Americans. It didn't matter; America was the protagonist who rose above their backstory, fought to change it, and won a free country.

The French nobility actually deserve some credit for the big win. They sent their military to help the Americans, which turned the tide at the all important battle of Yorktown. When hosting the after party the French nobility toasted to their success while giggling at the British for being "camera shy"; or whatever the term is for avoiding painted portraits.

The French people however weren't giggling. They were listening. The newly freed Americans had some captivating stories. French taverns, halls, and tennis courts, filled with the people's banquets and balls. Mental chains broke across the nation as a symphony of simple questions were asked; "So Rousseau's ideas weren't nuts?", "The people are in chains?", "We can break these damn chains?" The once scared, tired, and beaten French people grinned as they realized they could make the fairy tale stories of liberty, equality, and community, come true.

Surprise! The French people had their own revolution just six years after the American peace was signed. King Charles wasn't the only one who didn't see big changes to head off. Irony and puns aside, the point is the grand story of returning civil government to Western Europe was going strong by the 19th century.

Going strong because we enshrined the revolutionary benefits of modern technology like books, guns, and scientific instruments into our societies DNA. In particular free-speech, gun ownership, separating church and state, and government checks and balances were written into Constitutions; which replaced the Holy Bible as the ultimate reference guide for our (new) ruling philosophy. It wasn't perfect; early America had slavery for crying out loud, yet the seeds of liberty were planted and nobody could, or did, stop their growth.

Now what. The story to return security to Europe was well on its way. So what new problem did life want us to solve.

If you've ever been stranded, or watched a survival show, you know there are levels of priority when starting over in nature. The first is always safety. It's hard to do anything if you're dead. The second is resources like water, food, and shelter. Because it's hard to stay alive if you're cold and hungry. Turns out these levels of priority for a person, are also the levels of priority for a society.

Think of this. Rousseau, Jefferson, Madison, Washington, and the countless other revolutionary heroes, never used a toilet, turned on a light-bulb, watched a movie, wore rubber shoes, touched plastic, flew in a plane, drove a car, made a phone call, opened a fridge, took a picture, used penicillin, had an x-ray, started a motor, or listened to the radio.

If the free societies of post revolutionary American or France were around today we'd call them third world. Life needed its free societies to be better off, and kickstarted a new grand story; a new tapestry of human technological development to overcome poverty, cold, hunger, and disease. It's the story you are in today.

It's the one that chains you to your desk.

## Backstory's Are Weird

To break chains, we need to break from bad backstories. That takes some work, so before we start breaking your chains, let's study backstories a little more.

Let me start it off by saying global warming is not true. Stay with me, this is important. Global warming is a misunderstanding of basic science. Let me explain. The Earth and Moon were born over four billion years ago when massive astroids kept colliding into each other. After a very long time, and enough collisions, Earth formed as all planets do; as a sphere of lava, fire, rocks, metals, and gases, revolving around a star. The Moon formed from the kicked up dust of the last few, biggest, collisions. That's why there's no metal on the Moon, all the heavy stuff sunk down into Earth's core. Interesting to know, go science!

After several ions of being a firey hell, Earth formed a crust, a atmosphere, and oceans of water. After some more ions, Earth got an ecosystem that supported thousands of lifeforms. Soon it was millions, now it's billions of lifeforms. Earth is now life's Garden of Eden. This was obviously inevitable because it didn't happen on any other planet. In truth, life is invincible on Eden. It wasn't harmed at all during the relatively minor temperature swings we call Ice and Green Ages. Other than those mass extinctions.

Let's keep the scienctific facts going. It's a total coincidence the recent surge in Earth's temperature perfectly coincides with the Industrial Revolutions spewing massive amounts of gas into the atmosphere; it's totally natural and not "global warming". To play it safe though, we should just continue taking the extremely delicate balance, that made Earth into Eden, for granted and keep flying more planes and driving more sports cars; because vacations and pretending to be a race car driver is the only reason why God made Eden. It's a great idea because this way we'll keep threatening, what might be, the only place in the Universe that supports life. Score one for the only intelligent species in Eden.

Oh, and let's talk more about life. Saving life on Earth is what fighting climate change is about; nobody marches to stop the raging greenhouse effect on Venus. To be clear, remember this is science, human life begins at the second trimester. That's a fact jack. The childhood observation that parents in nature will viciously protect their eggs, or joey fetuses, is a weird one. After all, don't some animals abandon fully birthed kids to die if they have to. Surely then those parents wishes meant life hadn't started yet... So it's obvious that human life begins at...

Wait, let's check the cultural winds to be sure we're being getting the science right, and... yes... life starts at the second trimester plus two... no... one month. That was easy. Now we can go march! Here we come Washington DC! Because the date when human life starts it's agreed upon by everyone, always, and will never change, because the answer will always be life starts right after the first trimester. Unless the mother chooses differently based on a clear scientific standard that's independent of personal beliefs, careers, or how much money the guy has. Score one for ending climate change and saving _all life_ on Eden.

Ouch. That was a pretty vicious mocking of... hopefully everyone; you can see why people hated Rousseau so much. The point is if we're going to free you from your desk, we have to master your ruling philosophy. We do that by making you a protagonist who sees past their ruling philosophy. That means all of your ruling philosophy's DNA points, from climate change, to when life starts, to why you're chained to a desk, are opened to being mocked, ridiculed, and rethought. Kinda scary I know. Like the American or French protagonists, you have to be brave enough to tear down the past, take hold of the present, and make a better ruilng philosophy.

To understand your ruling philosophy we have to see its history. Not just what happened last month, or year, or even your life. Like real DNA, we can only understand your society's DNA when we sequence a large amount. And along the way we're going to encounter some weird things. People believing the Earth was the center of the Universe. People thinking God choose someone to be king. People thinking that everyone is born equal; except if they were poor, or non-white, or a woman.

We'll find out how to judge the good and bad ruling philosophies later. For now its important to not assume _your_ weird is okay. So despite maybe being pissed off at me for mocking global warming or abortion because they are matters of life and death; realize they aren't. Or better yet, realize how weird it is, that in both cases, one side says "this is life or death!", while the other side says "oh please, leave me alone!".

It gets even weirder because neither side will compromise. They are the exact same. Each values the "leave me alone" as much as the "life or death". Someone who believes global warming is actually threatening life on Earth, all the life in the Universe for all we know, will not trade Eden saving carbon reduction requirements, for a women's right to choose; something that in comparison will not save humanity from the suppossed catasrophe of "climate change". This makes as much sense as the pro-lifer who says abortion is murder, but won't trade their vacations, or their sports cars, to help bring on more support and end the supposed "unborn holocaust". Both groups believe in life and death, yet get away with not acting like it, because neither are protagonists.

Keep that in mind when we journey into our past. It's easy to giggle and insult ideas like "a divine nobility"; except when you realize we're in that same weirdness. Today we argue over, what will be to the future, extremely minor details about who understands our ruling philosophy better as exampled by my climate change and abortion mockery. We all get away with being weird because we haven't mastered our ruling philosophy. Like Jedi and Sith soldiers who just start firing at "climate change hippies" or "pro-life monsters"; instead of sharing beers, swaping ideas, and deciding what to think based on what technology tells us is possible.

By learning our backstory, we're all going to become protagonists. Protagonists master their beliefs by asking questions and finding hard truths inside their backstories. Protagonists then swallow their pride, and act to make changes they think are better for the grand story. The American colonialists did it when they became revolutionaries; but so did the British nobles who eventually signed the peace treaty despite really not wanting to. A few decades after the Revolutionary War, Britain and the USA started talking again, traded with one another, and called the past war "The Cousin's War" to ease tensions. If you refuse to do that today, over "hot issues" like global warming and abortion, then you're just a committed antagonist. You can safe yourself some time, stop reading this book, and instead go buy a Darth Vader mask.

Because your defending the way things _are_, and not rising above to fight for a better future. It's scary to rise above a backstory, that's why we cherish protagonists who try for it. But remember we must understand ruling philosophies, _and_ the technological development that will eventually discredit them. Our ruling philosophy is already changing.

Because we're in the Digital Age. It will discredit our ruling philosophy for precisely its ability to find answers to the many weird and contradictory things we believe in. We can finally track carbon levels, know who is responsible, and say this is what the Earth can tolerate; so (maybe) no race car for you. And we can finally analyze human cell growth, in real-time, on camera, and come to an agreement "this is the moment when _we_ are alive"; so (maybe) live with life.

And even better, we can finally change society to these new facts. Like not forcing workers to drive all the time by making telecommuting a right that will save Eden; and giving women the (technological) ability to decide when they get pregnant.

The Digital Age empowers us all to be protagonists. And heroes don't stagnate. They hate seeing everyone suffer because they can't use modern techology to change a flawed backstory. Heroes move civilization forward. The best protagonists do it without revolutions. The first step to making you an protagonist is explaining the backstory that first gave you security, then liberty, but now chains you to your desk and fills your days, your life, with useless, mind numbing busy-work. Once we understand why, we can start a techvolution. At the end we'll host our own peace talks while laughing with each other over some beers. Nobody will be camera shy, because we'll all be happy to be in the portrait.

## Where Our Ruling Philosophy Comes From

To fully understand your backstory, we're going deep, to before the start of Western Civilization, and into the anarchy of Western Rome's collapse. Because understanding the slow rebuilding of civil government in western Europe, is how far back your backstory goes.

Remember, there is nothing weird in this backstory. Story genres include tragedies, comedies, and romances, but "weird" isn't one for a reason. Weird comes from bad writing. Weird is a temporary contradiction that history eventually corrects with a better ruling philosophy. The trick for us is to understand how new technology forms new ruling philosophies, so we can change ours to the Digital Age proactively with a techvolution. Here we go.

Early Imperial Rome was very successful. So successful the time between 27-180 is called the _Roman Peace_; a time of peace and prosperity that attracted millions to Rome's excellent roads, ordered cities, fresh water, steady food, relative safety, common language, single currency, valued citizenship, entertaining culture, effective military, and most importantly, stable politics.

Success however created huge problems. After 180, Rome controlled the entire Mediterranean basin, had many different peoples, and suffered huge infighting. All this made Rome very hard to govern. In 380, after cenutires of civil wars and general decline, Emperor Theodosius I thought making the once outlawed Christianity the official State Church would reunite Rome's many different classes and peoples and stablize Rome's politics again.

Keeping the reforms going, in 395 Theodosius I also thought massive Rome would be more easily governed it it was divided between two emperors. Western Rome, capitaled at Rome, was modern day Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, Holland, Britain, France, Spain, Egpyt, Libya, Tunisia, and Morroco. And Eastern Rome, capitaled at Constantinople, was modern day Greece, Balkans, Turkey, Armenia, Syria, Black Sea, Israel, Jordon, and Iraq.

Eastern Rome was rich and healthy, the West was not. It was declining fast and despite attempts to reverse the trends, it soon was a shell of its former glory. After yet another barbarian invasion, Western Rome finally fell when it's last Emperor was forced out in 476. Nobody agrees on why the collapse happened. Frequent civil wars, declining Roman population, bloated civil administration, greedy military, lazy civilians, stupid emperors, relentless barbarian invasions, and the pacificying effects of Christianty are all on the list; and it was probably a mixture of them all. It's important to note, only Western Roman political government collapsed, its culture, language, prestige, and religion lived on.

Western Europe, the place where Rousseau and the noble's banquets and balls were held, did not exist in Roman times. Back then, people didn't have the regions of Europe, Africa, and Middle East we have today because everyone's identity was based on a unified Mediterranean world. Even after the collapse in 476, the western Roman provinces, controlled by the once invading barbarian tribes, still thought of themselves as provinces of the (eastern) Roman Empire. It wasn't until the Islamic conquest of the Roman provinces in the current Middle East and North Africa between 600-700 totally severed the ties with the Eastern Empire, that Roman provinces in the newly isolated "Western Europe" had to find their own identity.

This is important to remember. It means that from 476, Western Europe almost had to start a civilization from scratch, and from 600 Europe really had to go it alone. Thus, this is when Western Europe entered the Dark Ages; so called because there were so little Roman administration, infrastructure, or government left. Starting from scratch naturally meant building security first. Which was good because Western Rome's political collapsed let barbarians roam, Vikings raid, and general anarchy take hold.

Thus started the grand story to restore order to a newly created "Western Europe". It started small and with much bloodshed. Between 476-800, whichever tribe conquered the most would control Western Europe's new civilization. Germanic tribes had already pushed the Celts out into in modern Scotland, Wales and Ireland. Now various Germanic tribes you've never heard of like the Alemanni, Frisians, and Cimbri, competed for land with Germanic tribes you might have heard of like Franks, Saxons, and Anglos. As the latter tribes conquered, they slowly turned small wandering tribes into large established kingdoms.

Large kingdoms need ruling philosophies. The people's compliance is easier than their suppression. So the rulers of the new European kingdoms needed a new ruling philosophy everyone believed in, or could be converted to believe in. Germanic tribes were barbarian because they no history of civilization, citizenship, or formal religion. So to make their ruling philosophy the Germans used the one Roman institution still around; the Roman Catholic Church. But Christianty is too abstract to be a _ruling_ philosophy because it by itself doesn't mention details a society's DNA needs, like what scientific truth is, what people should wear, or who should govern and why. The rulers still needed to make their own ruling philosophy. They could could only use Christianty to fill in the DNA gaps.

The Dark Age's rulers thus slowly created the "nobles divine right to rule". Among the most important rulers was Clovis I, a Frankish King who converted to Christianty in 496 and conquered most of what is now (hence the name) France. His family dynasty would continue fighting off Vikings and Arabs until being usurped by Pepin The Short in 751. Despite his size, Pepin had a big impact on history because his son Charlemagne re-united most of Rome's old Eurpean provinces (minus Spain which was under Arab rule) into one kingdom. In 800 he was crowned king by the Roman Catholic Pope, and declared the new "Holy Roman Emperor".

Western Rome was reborn, if only in name because no attempt was made to rejoin with the still prosperous (Eastern) Roman Empire. The two sides had constant disagreements about religion. Things like the procession of the Holy Spirit, whether leavened or unleavened bread should be used in Mass, and if the Pope was the leader of all churches. To most people today these are extremely minor details, yet they caused the two halves of ancient Rome, new West, and old East, to officially called it quits in the Great Schism of 1054. Afterwards Western Europe was alone, with its own leadership, religion, and ruling philosophy. This was the start of what we call Western Civilization.

After Charlemagne died in 814, and his descendeants couldn't hold it together, Charlemagne's empire was divided up into the Kingdom of France, Kingdom of Italy, and many small Kingdoms of Germany united under the banner of Holy Roman Empire. Everyone kingdom was Catholic and used the same ruling philosophy of a nobles divine right to rule. Around 1000, Western Civilization was stable and safe enough to leave The Dark Ages and enter the High Middle Ages.

## The High Middle Ages

The High Middle Ages went from 1000 to about 1300. It wasn't a perfect world, but there was far less raids, barbarians, and anarchy. It must have been a huge relief for the average person. The rulers and their priests took the time, to solidfy their rule by using several passages in the Bible to explain noble divinity to the people. It was a stretch, but there weren't many books back then, and the common people couldn't understand or read Latin anyway. The truth is, the rulers brought enough peace and security people _believed_ in their "divine nobiliy". Using the Bible to justify the rulers didn't create their rule. It just solidfied it.

This was fantastic! For the first time in centuries, the political authority of Western European countries were centralized into one institution, the nobility, that was passed on without civil wars, and everyone believed in the Catholic Church who sanctioned everything as approved by God. As early Imperial Rome already proved, such political security is the healthy soil that grows a new civilization. This is because with security every person can play a character like baker, builder, craftsman, cooper, peasant, instead of being raided, enslaved, or killed in anarchy.

The High Middle Ages developed a political and economic system called feudalism. Watch Game of Thrones and you'll see how it worked. Nobles ruled over society. Knights were sworn to protect society. Some lucky commoners were land-owning gentry who helped organize the day to day operations in the towns. The vast majority of people were peasants, trying to grow enough food to survive the winter, or live through the hand to hand combat in a grusome battlefield as a untrained soldier. And lastly there was priests, who told everyone to follow God's will; which really meant to do a good job in you're own micro-story, inside the grand story, of feudalism returning civilization to Europe.

It kind of sucked that when someone asked back then "what you do for a living", they were really asking "who's your family". A person's character wasn't based on merit, but on birth. To buy into this system the peasants needed the mental chains of a religious obligation to follow their leaders. Which is what the divine right to rule was. But this only kinda sucked because coercion was still better then anarchy. So although peasants sometimes revolted, and were severly punished if disobedient, most followed their nobles because society was getting better. Everyone bought into the divinity of the system and their holy role inside it.

Feudalism is remembered for kings and queens, chivalry, Catholicism, cathedrals, armour plated knights, frequent crusades, rampant superstituion, poor peasants, and huge castles. It was because of these huge castles Western Civilization kept advancing. Inside and near there walls, society's characters could keep working and thereby reintroduce ever more advanced technologies inside their micro-stories. Things like sewers, wells, barrels, irrigation, food stores, even libraries kept getting added and improved. Despite many examples to the contrary, everyone worked on improving society inside their micro-stories. The stabilty of this system, meant the grand-story of Western Civilization kept improving itself in the great tapestry of life.

The Feudalism of the High Middle Ages lasted until about 1300. Europe was controlled by the noble families. The most powerful were the Bourbons in France, Stuarts in Britain, and Hapsburgs in Austria. Feuldalism gave Western Europe a unique identity. We remember the chivalry of "Medieval Times" warmly inside stories like _Lord of the Rings_ because the great civilization it planted is our own. Their ruling philosophy had many features we'd recognize today. The noble's divine right to rule, no equality, the joining of church and state, peasants with no right to arm themselves, no free-speech, no religious toleration, and the Holy Bible as the supreme authority on society's DNA. Nothing was weird for the people living it. Feudalism worked.

With strict conformity to the system. Conformity made the security that fueled everyone's betterment, from peasant farmers, to preaching priests, to even princesses waiting for the prince. Unfortunately, there wasn't a happy ending to this fairy tale. Each stake of the ruling philosophy would die byway of revolution.

## The Late Middle Ages

So let's look at the situation so far. Rome covered the known world with a civilzation and a religion, and then got fragmented. Western Rome was isolated and chaotic until strong Germanic warriors established kingdoms, using Christianity to cement their rule as divine hereditary nobles. Concentrating political security into a noblility let western society advance into Western Civilization. Western Europe was strong enough to send crusades against barbarians in Eastern Europe (this time Lithuaisns were the barbarians), and against Muslims in the once Roman Holy Land to try and spread their now distintt ruling philosophy. Western European crusaders even sacked "heretical" Eastern Rome's capital Constantinople in 1204, and dealt their old cousins a nearly mortal wound.

Regardless, at the end of the High Middle Ages, around 1300, Western Europe had a distinct civilization, with healthy agriculture, stable politics, the first universities, and relative peace. While not as good as the _Roman Peace_, it was the best time to be alive in Europe since.

Now what. What's the natural course of action. Would the leaders emulate Athenian democracy, or Roman Republicism and return citizenship, rights, and dignity to the masses? Nope. Not least because they didn't know about that stuff; they had few books back then. And besides, Athens and Rome were small towns when they experimented with their unique ruling philosophies, and worse neither ruling philosophy lasted that long anyway. The Kingdoms of Western Europe were huge and had millions of subjects. All of who depended on feuldalism to survive. So no changes were made to society's dependable ruling philosophy. Noble divinity stayed absolute.

Europe didn't have much time to think about it anyway. Everything went to hell starting in 1317 when Europe entered into the terrible Late Middle Ages. Europe had several huge faminines, large peasant revolts, and the Black Plague; all of which killed half the population in a few decades. Things got so chaotic _Game of Thrones_ is actually based on the Late Middle Ages. While not as bad as Rome's collapse, it was the worse time to be alive since. Now the ruling philosophy definitely wouldn't change. Europe needed to re-establish security as fast as possible. Although there were still technological innovations, like the printing press, the English longbow, and the first cannon's. Life wasn't very good for the average person between 1300-1453.

Would changing the ruling philosophy during the good times of the High Middle Ages have helped Europe advance its civilization better? Maybe. But change it to what? There was no guide, no books, few histories of Roman or Greek societies, and no reason to change the DNA of society. Naturally speaking, we only change the ruling philosophy of a large society when a series of transformative new technologies burst onto the scene, which enables great thinkers to think of a new DNA, which empowers the people to fight for a better ruling philosophy in a revolution. We know this, because this is the story of the next 500 years in European history. We're going to learn from it now, to help us how we can do the same thing via techvolution.

## Intermission

Before we talk about 500 years of revolution filled history, here's a simple observation to explain what you'll learn. If we think of clothes as props in a story, like Cinderella going from actually rags to rich dresses in her fairy tale; we can see a huge trend in Europe's leaders that tells us what we'll learn about revolutions. Look up art of Charles Martel or Charlemagne and you'll see they're wearing body armor. Starting around 1450 or so, their descendents like Louis XIV or Charles I are wearing dresses.

The lesson is the original nobility ruled because _they_ secured security. They led armies in battles against evil, and lived in the castles that defended the people. Because they were personally responsible for the people, the nobles had the love (or fear) of their commanders, soldiers, and family members. Government was largely based on this personal power, almost like a mafia. And they actually took the job seriously. I mean if society fell to invaders, the ruling nobles were the first to get the chop.

Fast forward a few centuries, and the later nobility lived inside palaces, with government bureaucracies doing most of the work. Civilization establised a government with courts for justice, ministries to build roads, collect taxes, approve research, and ambassadors to meet with foreign dignataries. Kings were basically executives administering with meetings, paperwork and their whim. Even wars were increasingly civilized. Unlike in the barbaric past, after around 1450, when a kings army lost to other nobles, the rulers were deposed and usually left alone, or found sanctuary at a cousin's palace somewhere living their life as a "pretender". Not kidding "pretender" is the term for a dress wearing noble kicked out of their kingdom, still claiming to be the rightful king. Show how often it happened.

When nobles started wearing dresses, government was like it was in Roman times; a full civilization. The nobles stories were totally different from 800 to 1450. The dresses highlight the massive changes in technology. Each new technology made the nobles divine right to rule suspect. Guns made knights armour useless. Cannon's made castle's a liability. Mass printed books made knowledge common. Technology was fundamentally changing society, yet the only thing that didn't change was the title of noble, and the ruling philosophy that justified the nameplate of kings and queens, dukes and duchesses.

As a result, society's protagonists changed. Clovis I, Charles Martel, Charlemagne were divine heroes because they rose above the backstory of anarchy and established a lasting, secure, kingdom. However starting around 1450, the nobles were antagonists resisting changes to the backstory of their divinity. Instead of spreading the fruits of a growing civiization, the nobles turned castles into palaces, gave guns only to their soldiers, and censured books. And worst, rather than forming a lasting peace, because there was finally no more barbarians, or Vikings raiding Western Europe, the nobles told their armies to  battle for the nobles personal glory in dozens of useless wars. They called this useless search for personal glory "gloire" because French had replaced Latin as Europe's common language.

The leaders micro-stories were distanced from humanity's grand tapestry of technological improvement. They used the fruits of new technology to surround themselves in opulance that increasingly deluded them into thinking they helped society's by just being born, going to war, and spending lots of money on themselves. Whatever rationale they needed to come up with, like not paying taxes, avoiding civil responsibilities, or using the religion of a poor carpenter to rationalize their aged ruling philosophy, they did. They were like celebrities who are famous for being famous. The nobles gave themselves trophies, titles, ceritifications, and honours, merely by participating in their increasingly common banquets and balls that turned the people into Cinderella dreaming their days away, wondering when they were going to get a piece of the cake.

Society's protagonists became those who could see through this bullshit. They set out to change the backstory of noble divinity to be aligned with new technology. Different people in science, medicine, and politics would rise above. They were usually poor, oppressed, and had a fascination with nature as they started down the road to dismantle society's ruling philosophy. We take note to help us do the same for you, sitting there chained to your desk, wondering when you'll get a piece of the cake, but learning how you will, with a heroic techvolution.

## Renaissance

Everything in Western Europe changed in 1453. That's when happily, or sadly depending on your perpective, (Eastern) Rome finally fell to the Turks. Eastern Rome had been declining fast since being sacked in 1204 and never regained it's footing, especially since the ascending Turks were growing a huge empire in the eastern Mediterrean. Happily for Western Europe, eastern Rome never lost the love of Greek philosophy the West has largely forgotten about. When so many Greek scholars fled the Turks, they flooded into still superstituous Western Europe. These Greeks supercharged the young Renaissance. If you've ever visited Vatican City, Florence, or Milan you've seen the huge changes Western Europe was in for.

The Greek philosophy of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle teaches many things. Some of it turned out to be wrong, like the Earth being the centre of the Universe, but Greek Philosophy is still the most important thing to learn in human history. Because no philosophy will always be right, the important thing is to be honest about mistakes, learn from them, and if need to, good deep and question the philosophy you had when making a mistake. The ability to self-correct makes a ruling philosophy great.

In all of human history so far, Greek philosophy is the best at questioning everything, most of all, itself. Probably because it was started by Socrates, who pissed off the rulers in Athens so much they put him on trial for "irreligion and corrupting the youth". During his trail Socrates responded to the charges by saying he should be rewarded with a state pension for asking to many helpful questions about Athens' ruling DNA. Instead he was executed. Thus, Greek philosophy's own DNA lets anyone, question anything. Getting persecuted for questions is a compliment.

Thus, when Greek philosophy arrived in Western Europe it asked profound questions and starting calling bullshit a lot. The countless DNA points of the ruling philosophy were rethought. The new questions all had the same theme; using Christianty to underpin a ruling philosophy was weird. Stripping away the religion of a poor carpenter from the nobles divine right to govern, deterimine scientific truth, tell commoners to "stay in their place", and making priests the source of all knowledge, was tough. Yet Greek philosophy started doing it anyway.

Yet revolutions don't just need new questions, they need new answers enabled by new technology. Eastern Rome and Islam had studied Greek Philosophy for centuries, but they both didn't have the tools Europe started to get in the Renaissance. Among the most important was the printing press (1439), musket (1500), telescope (1608) and microscope (1610). These, and so many others, helped protagonists not only question the ruling philosophy, but revolutionize it.

Today we call this new ruling philosophy "modernity". A age of humanity we live in because many protagonists fought to overturn, and create a fundamentally new ruling philosophy, still partially rooted in the Holy Bible, but based on more accurate truths about nature give to us by modern technology. Modernity didn't burden Christianty to fill the gaps in our DNA. Because we finally had the real answers about nature, using science.

## Modernity

The first modern protagonist was Niccolo Machiavelli (1469-1527). Like most modern protagonists he was poor, but his father got him many books from the recent printing press, and mixing a commoner upbriging with a great education proved itself again to be the best gift a parent can give. Machiavelli read much Greek and Roman history and philosophy and soon thought religion was over used in his time. This helped him be the first person to see through Europe's ruling philosophy. Machiavelli foresaw a new ruling philosophy where humanity overcomes problems, like society's security, not with using religion, but human reason. So instead of using a "nobles divine right to rule" to guarantee security, society can organize itself into republics with governments designed to give a country both security and freedom.

Machiavello wanted to do even more then bring back republics. He wanted to get Europe, especially Italy which was fragmented among many city-states like Florence and Milan, off of religion. This was a bugger of a problem. It required a massive rethink of societies entire DNA.

Machiavelli tried anyway. He was poor with nothing to lose. He studied history and learned that the most successful people and societies didn't rely on religion for its DNA. He gave many examples of wise leaders like Julius Caesar who would adjust their actions to situations. These great examples wouldn't blame fortune or "God's Will", but their own inability to overcome problems. Religion was a crutch, and now an especially unneeded crutch for a society with the printing press and scientific instruments. Humanity could master the many misfortunes of nature with modern technology.

If, Machiavelli said, humanity were to wise up. Machiavelli said we could too, if we ignored the "imagined world" of the old ruling philosophy and judge human actions for their "effectual truth" on making the real-world better or not. Machiavelli called for new "modes and orders" to make Italy, and Europe at large, more rational. He wanted Europe to throw away it's irrelevant ruling philosophy and instead embedded the possibiliiies of new technology into a new ruling philosophy.

Few people understood what the heck Machiavelli was talking about. His anti-religion book was even published with the Pope's blessing. But it wasn't long before people realized Machiavelli wanted to change all Europe's DNA. In response, much of Europe called him the Antichrist. "Old Nic" was even a term for the Devil! The ruling philosophy interpreted modernity from its own shell. So in a sense Machiavelli was _their_  Antichrist. To us he was the first modern thinker, who died a failure. It's ironic that he didn't believe in an afterlife, because in death, he could at least smile as his words brought down the ruling philosophy he hated so much.

Brought down because people slowly started to understand what Machiavelli meant, and his call for "effectual truths" was answered. Soon enough a chorus of people who, like him, started to question the ruling philosophy in astronomy, religion, medicine, politics, and more. As ever more technologies got invented and adopted throughout Europe, new modern thinkers like Francis Bacon developed the Scientific Method, which was a systematic way to test and find effectual truth. Starting with Copernicus's _On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres_, scientists like Galileo, Kepler and Newton overcame much religious opposition from the ruling philosophy when they participated in the Scientific Revolution (1543-1687).

There were many battles, but scientific truths replaced religious ones inside Western Civilization's scienctifi c DNA. And Christianity was itself liberated from having to answer questions it simply wasn't meant to. Alas, it was these scientists, inspired by Machiavelli, who set the standard for furture movements against the divine rights of the nobility ruling philosophy.

## Modernity On Hold

Unfortunately, despite "effectual truth" winning in the natural sciences, during the Scientific Revolution the nobles still wore dresses in their palaces while they hosted even more banquets and balls. Ironically, many of the parties were celebrating their funding of the new sciences like astronomy, medicine, anatomy, and physics. The nobles even competed with one another to fund the best advancements.

Sadly, despite Machialli being a political theorist, his scientific followers couldn't revolutionize the politcs of a noble Europe. Thus, the first political attack on the ruling philosophy came, not from modern science, but from Christianity. It was freed from science but was still used inside politics. The Protestant Reformation hit Europe in 1517. While there had been attacks on the excesses of the nobles and Catholic leaders before, Martin Luther's and John Calvin's Protestanism was different. Europe was ready for change, but political philosophy didn't have any useable new answers yet.

Thus, Protestantism spread massively throughout politically disgruntled Northern Europe. Protestant leaders didn't revolutionize Europe. They wanted to protest and reform the Christianity that supported thrones, not get rid of thrones. Thus, while the ruling philosophy got different justifications from the Holy Bible, it didn't change much. Kings were still kings, priests were still priests, the people were still peasants. Like the Great Schism of 1054, Catholics and Protestants tore Europe a part arguing over, what's to us, extremely minor details.

Europe went through a wave of religious wars between 1517-1648. They were horrible. It was the worst time to be alive since the Late Middle Ages. Game of Thrones II could be based on these religious wars and even HBO couldn't get away with so much horror. Unlike Clovis I and Charlemage's struggles to establish a government, or Copernicus's and Galileo's struggle to prove science worked; Europe's wars of religion did nothing political compromise couldn't achieve. Both Catholic and Protestant countries already had civilized political systems, and were just arguing over the details of religion. After the especially brutal and horrendous Thirty Years War (1618-1648) both sides finally agreed to disagree and signed the Treaty of Westphalia. The treaty is a very expensive historical landmark. It finally recognized every countries political borders and right to govern itself.

After Westphalia European countries started to grow up and master their fates like Machiavelli dreamed about. They stopped being feudal kingdoms fighting over thrones, stopped being petty nobles fighting over religion, and started to become independent nation-states encouraged to compromise. While European countries still fought wars, for example the Seven Years War (1756-1763), it was increasingly more civilized. All countries had official borders and governments with ambassadors. They signed alliances, and when one side won over a territory, they warring parties would sign peace treaties honouring the take over, almost like how a company today sells a "division" to another.

However, with no political moderization forthcoming for the average person, the European peasants started to fight for their independence inside religion. They held modern technology like guns, books, and telescopes in their hands, yet were still treated like scared villagers in need of protection. So while the Treaty of Westphalia was being negotiated, King Charles I was fighting the English Civil War (1642–1651). Charles wanted to be in total control of England's government, while many Englishman wanted an elected parliament to govern. They fought for many years, and Charles lost his throne. Importantly, he wasn't just replaced by another family member. Instead he was tried for treason against the English people. A divine noble was fired for being a bad leader by his own people. The fact Charles paid foreign mercenaries with national money to fight local Englishman didn't help. This shows how the peasantry were maturing at the same time their new nation-states were as well.

The army that defeated King Charles I called themselves the "New Model Army". Unlike noble armies, its positions were gotten by merit instead of birth, they were quick to learn new battle tactics, and soldiers were fiercely patriotic because they were locals. These weren't scared, superstituous, unarmed peasants anymore. They were still very religious. But these protagonists soon got political protagonists to empower them past the chains of they're religous ruling philosophy.

## Political Protagonists in The Age of Enlightenment

The Scientific Revolution discovered many wondrous details of the universe. Things like the Earth revolves around the Sun, human anatomy, and the laws of motion. Scientists made using the Holy Bible the basis of all human thought look silly. While most of these scientists were faithful Christians in their personal beliefs, they advocated using science as humanity's new and improved ruling philosophy for understanding how the natural world worked. They were thus revolutionaries. And it was in their tradition of questioning the natural world, that spawned the Age of Enlightenment (1687-1789). The Enlighenment was when humanity itself "wised up" by directing scientific questions to better understand not just nature, but human nature.

Europe needed this. The noble political institutions that once brought divine peace and prosperity, were causing social chaos, because during Europe's grusome wars of religion, people stopped believing God was above them, and instead thought God was behind them in their battle against the other side's heresy.

Europe fought itself because nobody created a new political philosophy to modernize it's politics. Thankfully, it wasn't long before dress wearing, banquest obsessed, cake eating, self-described divine nobles, were under the spotlight of science.

Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679), writing during the chaos of the English Civil Wars, started the long process to give Europe a new political ruling philosophy. He started it by defending an absolute monarchy, saying something Charlemagne might agree with; a super strong government is better than chaos. No surprise there. we already learned how important political stabilityi is. Hobbes said everyone should obey one king, who he called Leviathan, to avoid the anarchy that makes human life that is "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." This may not seem new, but it was.

Because how Hobbes justified his nobility was monumental. Like Machiavello, Hobbes disliked religion, so he didn't use the "divine right to rule". Instead, he said humanity is naturally, in our State of Nature, equal. The State of Nature is a place without government, like Western Europe when Rome collapsed. We're all equal there because, well whose to say otherwise. Hobbes biggest proof of our equality is, without government, we can all kill each other with our ability to scheme, plot, and murder. So to keep everyone from killing each other, the people should forfeit their natural rights of equality to a Leviathan to ensure everyone's peace.

Thus, _the King_ and _the People_, would have a social contract with each other. One based on equality, that ends in complete tyranny, but that guarantees everyone's security, which as we've learned before is the soil that grows a healthy civilization. This reasoning, believe it or not, started the liberalism that we have today. From constitutions, to the right to own property like race cars, and the right to control ones body with abortions, all guaranteed by the social contract between the people, and the government. Guaranteed if these rights didn't threaten the country's all important security.

We'd recognize this liberalism better after reading John Locke (1632-1704). Locke agreed with Hobbes that humanity is prone to killing itself in our state of nature, and so it's best if individuals and government had a social contract based on equality and a strong government. But Locke put the brakes on a single person having all the power. Instead, Locke said the people should arm themselves, government should be elected, divided, and constitutional. This way the people can have a strong government, without the tyranny. Locke says it's too idealistic to expect one person to be Leviathan. If power corrupts, then absolute power corrupts absolutely. Thus, Locks says its best to divide government powers up, and make them battle each other, to prevent a government that's worst than the anarchy it's supposed to get rid of.

Locke's philosophy is responsbile for much of our society's political workings today. Our written constitutions, bills of rights, elected governments, citizens right to bear arms, checks and balances between executives, elected legislatures, lawful judges, freedom of speech, and freedom of religion, are all because of Locke. It's under Locke's philosophy that Hobbes's Leviathan and social contract got implemented into the real world. The technology of mass printed books, guns, scientific instruments and many others, were enshrined by Locke into society's DNA, via constitutions, which finally replaced the Holy Bible as society's ultimate reference guide for our ruling philosophy. Most people today live under Locke's Leviathan.

Rousseau (1712-1778) somewhat agreed with Locke and Hobbes. Rousseau agreed humanity is naturally equal, but said humanity is only murderous in a society. If a thinker goes back farther into human nature and history, they'd find happy go luck hunter gatherers who weren't filled with the envy, jealously, or anxiety of modern humans living under "fake" or oppressive ruling philosophies. This is where the Rousseau's new philosophy, "Man is born free; but everywhere he is in chains" that we discussed earlier came from. Rousseau says yes society needs a social contract, but one that harnesses the natural goodness of humanity.

Rousseau thus keeps Hobbes' social contract, but wants to create a new person to live inside it (often ridiculed as a "noble savage"). Rousseau's Leviathan is not concentrated into a single person, or even a checked and balanced government, but is distributed throughout society via direct democracy. Meaning there are no representatives of government inside a nobility, or a elected representatives. Instead, all people who live under the all powerful Leviathan, also control the Leviathan.

To have this new society, requires a totally "new person". Someone who can give responsible commands to society, while accepting the rules society gives back. Rousseau's ideal world is definitely not feudalism. He totally disregards the nobles divine right to rule. Which is why he was chased around a Europe ruled by nobles. One sympathetic noble, Frederick the Great, a noted "Enlightened Ruler" (that's what well-intentioned nobles called themselves during the Enlightenment) once sent Rousseau some money for rent. Frederick's description brightens the divide between the old divine nobility, and the new social contract ruling philosophies:

    >We must succor this poor unfortunate (Rousseau). His only offense is to have strange opinions which he thinks are good ones. I will send a hundred crowns, from which you will be kind enough to give him as much as he needs....If we were not at war, if we were not ruined, I would build him a hut with a garden, where he could live as I believe our first fathers did...I think poor Rousseau has missed his vocation; he was obviously born to be a famous hermit, celebrated for his meagre living...I conclude that the morals of his savage are as pure as his mind is illogical.

Both Rousseau's idealism, and Locke's practicality, was the basis of the American and French Revolutions. Since Rousseau, many societies have tried to make his ideal world come true. Sadly, unlike with Locke's the technology hasn't existed yet to make it practical.

But alas, these political protagonists did for politics what Galileo and Newton did for astronmy. They gave people a fundamentally different way to view the world, and thereby change the ruling philosophy's DNA. Now unlike when the New Model Army in the English Civil War, the common people had a different political philosophy to fight for.

And fight they did. The nation-states Europe created in 1648, were democratized inside revolutions. This meant the nobles and the political revolutionaries were using two completely different ruling philosophies. Which is why the nobles simply couldn't see such massive changes a head.

## Political Protagonists in Power

The Treaty of Westphalia was the start of nation-states. Instead of countries being kingdoms competing for land or glory, nation states using international relations respects a countries monopoly over its land, in return for acting responsibly to foster peace. And it worked. Because once competition was discouraged, countries could collaborate about their problems. The book I mentioned earlier, _On War_, taught this by explaining war is really politics, so why shouldn't countries talk and compromise more, and save the bloodbath wrought by competition (but if you must fight the author Von Clausewitz teaches how to end it quickly). Although American and Europe still warred in the Napeolonic Wars, the American Civil War, and the Franco-Prussian War, it was increasingly less often; especially as more countries democratized. When the common person, the one fighting the wars on the battlefield, is ruling their society, they don't tend to want more wars than absolutely necessary. Empowering the people breeds collaboration.

Regardless we already know the nobility stuck around too long. It usually took revolutions to get rid of them, although some nobility went more easily. The ones who didn't were kicked out after the disaster of World War I (1914-1918). WWI was such a huge disaster because it was the first war fought after the Industrial Revolution. All of a sudden noble families, still obessed with their glory, and accustomed to fighting with horses, swords, and muskets, were commanding armies using massive artillery pieces with huge explosives, machines guns, radios, chemical weapons, planes, and tanks. History never did show a more obvious example of new technology, being ruled by a past-due philosophy and nobility.

Trench warfare. Gas attacks. Men with bolt-action rifles charging machine guns nests. Days of artillery barages. All becacause the same nobles who could not proactively update their philosophy to democratization, also couldn't update to the possibitiles of the modern warfare either. Europe burned for it.

Twice. Because World War I had an even worse sequel in World War II (1939-1945). However the sequel was so disatrous it really pushed the nobles out entirely; this time out of their home countries and their worldwide colonies. After WWII, Europe, even the democracies, lost her empires as the wave of revolutions that freed Europeans a century early, spanned the globe.

Politically free democracies, while not uniform, or everywhere, are now the norm in the world. The ruling philosophy dreamed by Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau, was also dreamed by many Cinderella's, and made real by the people into a new ruling philosophy with many revolutions.

Democractic countries now collaborate so well the time since World War II is called _The Long Peace_; the longest period of prosperity in the world since Imperial Rome's _Roman Peace_. The grand story to return peace to the western Rome has finally concluded. Now Cinderella just needed her glass slipper.

## Your Ruling Philosophy - New Grand Story

Well that was fun. Thanks for sticking around. Hopefully I didn't lose too many. I know that was kind of long, but I also summarized the history of Western Civilization like a champ so I'm proud of both of us. Like all summaries there are gaps and generalizations. Thank heavens for the interent, you can research anything you want. And yahoo! Now you know your history, which is also your backstory, and thus you can become a protagonist by breaking the mental chains that bind you to it.

Almost. We're almost there I promise. Remember the levels of priority when starting over in nature. The first is always safety. Clovis I to Charlemagne built safety by embedding strong political leadership and castles into Europe with feuldalism. These made Europe safe enough that the ruling philosophy of the divine rights of the nobility took hold, only being removed by revolutions. Once the revolutions were won, the grand-story to return Europe to the political stabilty and peace lost in Rome's collapse was achieved.

Life didn't celebrate. Life is a worker, and it needed its free societies to be better off, and kickstarted a new grand story; a new tapestry of human technological development to overcome poverty, cold, hunger, and disease. It's the story you are in today. The reason we spent so much time understanding the rise and fall of kingdoms, is because this new grand story is very similar, except this time kingdoms were called companies.

Here is where your own ruling philosophy comes from. One that mixes the political freedoms of Rousseau and Jefferson, but includes the philosophy of economic kingdoms that share much in common with their deceased political cousins. Our ruling philosophy is called liberal free-market economics. It has political liberties and freedoms, but also strict economic obligations of feudal hierachies that replaces the "nobles divine rights to rule", with its "divine rights of property owners". And, in the timeline of grand stories, you are politically free, but economically bound in chains, in pre-revolution American and France, waiting for a Rousseau to inspire you to freedom.

## Our Rulng Philosophy - Part I - Free Markets

Towards the end of feudalism, Europe invented some cool technology. Among them was the quadrant, sandglass, nocturnal, and most important, the huge "ships of sail" you've seen in pirate movies. All this technology meant ships could store lots of food and water, navigate at night, and travel against the wind. Europe's leaders wanted this because when Eastern Rome fell in 1453, so did Europe's access to the famed spice road to India. Thus, it wasn't long until the European nobility sent explorers in their new ships to find a new route to India. They left 1492, but discovered a new world instead.

When Western Civilization found the New World, the European nobility quickly became the world's nobility. The nobility acted like their Germanic tribal ancestors who kicked the Celts out of mainland Europe. They used the same tools of military conquest, and Christianization to conquer North and South America, much of Africa and some of Asia too. They did use a different economic system this time. It's called mercantalism.

Merchantalism worked like this. European home countries like Britain, used their colonies, like America, for their abundant natural resources. Home countries imported natural resources like wood, cotton, and sugar, and made stuff like furniture, shirts and refined sugar. The home countries would buy some of this stuff, and then sell the rest to their own colonists. This cycle of importing natural resources, and exporting finished goods, happened in all European countrise and their colonies.

Importantly, Europe created merchantalism while going through it's horrendous wars of religion (1517-1648). Thus, merchantalism believed economic borders were the same as the political ones. As a result, European home countries almost never traded with each other. The made everything themselves. Merchantalism assumed a mutually beneficial relationship between countries couldn't exist.

The Treat of Westphalia in 1648 only cemented merchantialism. Although European countries would talk more after 1648, most notably in a constantly changing web of alliances that makes high school dramas look dull, the treaty made their internal affairs, including economics, officially their own business. So the only way to increase a country's economy was through alliances and war. Hence the web of alliances and the high school dramas about who's friends with who. This drama kept Europe fighting massive wars like the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714), War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748), and the Seven Years War (1756-1763).

Happily two protagonists eventually called merchantalism bullshit; Adam Smith (1723-1790) and David Ricardo (1772-1823). These enlightenment thinkers realized to rid the world of poverty, society needed to create much better technology, and that meant massive concentrations of resources into new castles called factories. Factories are the centres of power for the new economic kingdoms/companies. And like how castles let individuals play a character like baker, craftsman, and peasant. Factories let individuals throw away their feudal roles, and play even more productive characters, like millwright, weaver, machinist, engineer, and toolmaker.

However, one hiccup was borders. No country, no matter how big, could ever have enough resources to build all these new factories. Thus for any country to conquer poverty with companies and factories, they needed to share the burden. They did this by forming a new grandstory, that saw their shared poverty as economic anarchy similar to the political anarchy after Rome's collapse. To let companies conquer poverty, Europe needed to open the political borders it fought so hard to create. Only a world without economic borders would let the world unite inside the grandstory of economic growth.

Smith and Ricardo fostered economic growth. They replaced merchantalism with "free-market economics" using mathematics. They used the new math of Newton's physics, and discovered the great economic possibilities of a mutually beneficial relationship. Because the trade between countries, who each fostered their own companies and factories, would enable much more production and thereby grealy increase the wealth of all nations.

Trade help economic growth so well because it promotes economic specialization via "comparative advantage". The math shows if countries build companies and factores that only make a few products, like England with textiles companies and Germany with toolmaking companies, they can produce more stuff of a higher quality. Even if a country could be self-sufficient, it still mathematically makes sense to build specialized factories, mass-produce, and trade. Free-market economics was the fastest way to grow the new technologies that would conquer the economic anarchy causing the world's poverty.

When countries slowly opened their borders to trade, a company, a entity seperate from political control, was allowed to operate whereever it wanted to. Barriers like borders, language, culture didn't get in the way. Now, like seeds blowing in the wind, whichever markets a company could reach, grow in, and estabilsh themselves, they could compete in.

Unsurprisingly, the First Industrial Revolution (1760-1840), swept through the world on the back of free-market economics. New inventions kept getting invented. For the first time since animals were domesticated and steel was forged, humanity had access to fundamentally new tools; machines, chemicals, the loom, steam power, water power, and the rise of the mechanized factory system.

Countries moved from basic farming and scrapping by, to building factories that opened up a new world. Farmers, the descendents of feuldal peasants, moved from their small plots of land, to get jobs inside massively growing cities. Factories, and soon office buildings, replaced castles as the bringers of security. Those people who got inside, i.e. were hired, were protected from economic uncertainty. People lined up, hoping to get the chance to obey their new economic nobility inside a economic social contract. If workers help grow the economy, they can do whatever they want with their payment. Which was usually buy stuff like a stove, car, radio, or computer, and fuel more growth.

Free-market economics worked out great. Massive production of steam engines, cloth weaving, iron production, telegraphs, railroads, and so much more, kept getting faster, with more products made at a higher quality. And companies lead the charge to conquer poverty. Companies were like tribes, competing for survival in a wide open, anaric landscape, knowing the winners would establish kingdoms.

After the first battles were fought, the new tools empowered the even stronger Second Industrial Revolution (1870-1914) The stakes were higher. The winners knew they'd be like Charlemagne, and establish lasting kingdoms. The resulting economic war was fierce. Many tribal companies you've never heard of like Rock Oil, and Scranton Iron Furnaces, lost to companies headed by kings you might have heard of like John D. Rockefeller (1839-1937) and his Standard Oil, Andrew Carnegie (1835-1919) and his U.S. Steel Corporation, and J.P. Morgan (1837-1913) and his J.P. Morgan.

The wars to establish economic kingdoms didn't stop. The world still had much poverty. There was much economy left to grow. So new poverty killing technologies kept getting invented. Tractors, water pumps, vaccines, cars, calculators, all had new factories, with new kings sitting atop them as companies established themselves overtop the remains of so many dead tribes. Henry Ford (1863-1947), Bill Hewlett (1913-2001), David Packard (1912-1996), and Thomas Edison (1847–1931) and many other kings sat atop of new kingdoms for cars, power generation, electrical components, and telecommunications.

These economic kingdoms had a hierarchy like feudalism. Let's compare how they worked. Political nobles owned everything inside their realms, so do the owners of companies. They owned the property, the tools, the products, the copyrights, and freely decided who will access their castle/factory/office building.

The next rung down the hierarchy is the knights, the ones who protect the kingdoms and factories. Nation-states were happy to protect their, and the world's, factories. But economically protection was different. Brigades of lawyers, accountants, and university graduates, defended and attacked other kingdoms using the laws and finances of massive corporations.

Then there's the gentry, who ran the day to day operations for the nobilty. In economics these were managers and supervisors, who have the same skills as workers, but were graced with a bit of freedom, and thus the drive to maintain the heirarchy's efficiency by keeping the workers in line.

Then there's the peasants. The masses, who wilfuly, and rightfully, forfeited their natural rights of equality, to the new kingdom, in return for economic security. As a result they participated with their microstories to the grand tapestry of life's invention of technology to conquer poverty. They ran the machines, built the power stations, used the computers, which was pumping out so many poverty killing technology.

Oh, what about the priests. Where are the ones telling everyone in the system to stay in their lane. Where are the ones converting non-believers to the holy word of free-market economics. Where are the ones telling everyone only they can read the bible, because it's written in new Latin called mathematics. Say hello to the economists on CNBC. The "C" might as well stand for Catholic.

Like factories liberated people from their feudal roles of baker, or copper, as economics kept getting more secure, more people upgraded their roles. The "self-made" started to rule economics. Now when somebody asked "what do you do for a living" they were really asking "what do you do for a living". Increasinly, Cinderella dreamed of starting her own company, inventing a new tool, and becoming self-made, and hosting her own banquets and balls.

Like before, economic feuldalism, inside free-market economics, worked. Free-trade economics vastly out produced merchantialism. And although different economic systems have been tried since (mainly communism and facism which both tried to make Rousseau's new man, one using social engineering, the other genetic. Both were pure evil), nothing has come close to matching the economic growth of free-trade economics. That's why its spread across the globe, and survived even as the political empires that brought it have long fallen by way of political revolutions. And that's why free-market economics is one half of your ruling philosophy.

## Our Rulng Philosophy - Part II - Liberalism

Now for the political part of our ruling philosophy. After civil government returned to Europe and castles were made useless by canon's and mortars, the political nobility didn't have a reason to be in control of society anymore. Not that they saw that. The nobles still competed for their personal profit. These distrasous war achieved little because in the grand story of life, political institutions were already working well. So life didn't need noble "owners" to be in control, and power should therefore have been return to the people.

Sadly, it took the words of Locke, Rousseau and Jefferson to inspire the people to claim their governments in revolutions that spanded the glode.  However, once the people were in control, they needed new philosophies to guide them when making society's new DNA.

Here enter's the infamous conservatives and progressives. While they hate each other today, they both share the same purpose; what's the best way to manage the DNA of a political free, economically poor, society that's working really hard to raise the divine offspring of property owners to help conquer poverty byway of new technologies.

Conservatives have their own answer, originally written by Edmund Burke in 1790. Conservatism values tradition, and only wants changes byway of prudent adjustments to society's DNA based on practical experience. Conservatives thus want to slowly distribute the political and economic power of the rich and powerful. Slow and steady wins the race for a conservative. That's why Burke supported America's Revolution, and hated the French one. America was customizing British sensibilities to a new land and had a nearly blank DNA. The French Revolution on the other hand was trying to remake a 1,000 year old societal DNA; changing it all of a sudden would make society collapse and chaos take hold. Burke thus predicted America would flouish in liberty, while France would struggle through chaos and dictatorships. He was right, although France eventually got it right after a few decades.

The father of progressives is John Stuart Mill who wrote his textbook on progressvism in 1859. Mill's the opposite of Burke. While Burke says go slow and steady and only make prudent adjustments to society, Mill says to go fast because the living shouldn't have to wait for cranky old conservatives. Mill's asked why should an oppressed person be patient with their oppression? Liberty, and the progress towards more liberty, should thus be extended now to minorities, the needy, the oppressed etc.

This choice between going slow like a consevative, and going fast like a progressive is seen in every political issue in western politics. From health-care reform, to immigration, to gay marriage, to tax-policy, stock-market regulation, to everything. However, since conservatives and progressives drive together on the road of economic growth, just disagreeing on the speed of giving wealth and liberties to persons, is why they're both liberals with roots in Hobbes's, Locke's, and Rousseau's social contract.

Since they make such a big show today about hating each other, I started calling progressives and consertives _ProCons_. It's a way to not be tricked into thinking their hate makes them different. In fact they agree on almost everything; free-speech, right to bear arms, seperation of church and state, and checks and balances that their shared revolutions fought for. They disagree on details like what speech is not allowed, who should bear arms, and the organization of checks and balances. But these are extremely minor details to non-believers.

The greatest thing ProCons share is managing the ongoing poverty killing technological our ruling philosophy is designed to create. ProCons both harbour, foster, and encourage economic growth by encouraging companies across political borders. While conservatives obsesses over wealth generation and de-regulation, and progressives obsesses over wealth distribution and regulation, they both agree giant corporations should exist across countries, that they own all the property, and the average person should work for them to get their economic security.

ProCons even work together to help these economic kingdoms do business. Progressives shower new people's, either in untapped external markets like China, or untapped internal people like men who don't moisturize, with talk of inclusiveness, tolerance, and diversity to keep up the supply of cheap labour and new consumers. After the Pros open a new market, conservatives move in with their love of business, profit, and wealth, and supply poverty killing technology and start up new factories. This is how extremely strong oil, car, engineering, computer, software, construction companies span the globe as political empires once did. The system of liberal free-market economics is in full swing supported by ProCons everywhere. That's why liberalism, is the other half of your ruling philosophy.

## The Troubles

So now we're done. That's your ruling philosophy! Liberal free-market economics in a pretty nicely compressed chapter. I'm proud of both of us.  Now what. Right, I'm supposed to help you overcome it. Which implies there's something wrong with it. No, nothing wrong with it actually, there's something dated about it.

We did all that work to ask you a question. Where do you think we are today, in that grand story. Unless you think our history doesn't have trends, we're in there somewhere. So what part of the story from Rome to now, sounded familiar.

And here enters the troubles. Because we have to stop looking back at the past, and start looking at today, and our future. A extra can get by just following the rules. Like Sophia, first teaching Douglass to read, then punishing him for it, but never feeling responsible for her actions. Our history is full of extras, following the rules. A protagonist has to make choices, and rise above their backstory to make the world they want.

We'll never all agree on what's evil. But what about, what's good. Techvolution isn't about agreeing, it's about using digital technology to live more stories, faster, so we reach conflict, and agreement, faster, before hitting a revolution. Revolutions are what happens to extras who sit around waiting for history to catch up to them.

Looking back at our history, few people will agree on where we are today. But I'll go ahead and give my thoughts, you can compare with your own. You may have noticed I used the term "extremely minor details" several times. Catholic and Orthodox Christians arguing over who does Mass better. And Catholics and Protestants arguing over who justifies divine nobility better. Then ProCons; I can't for the life of me, tell the difference between ProCons. They have to fight so much to mask their sameness. Like two car dealerships advertising their SUV is the better one. Only someone obesseed with logos, colors, branding, and most of all loyalty, can tell the difference between a Ford and a Chevy. That means all our political questions, the countless questions we insert into our DNA like are we killing Eden with global warming, or when does human life start, are being answered by the same political philosophy.

You maybe saying the two sides disagree on global warming and abortion. They don't. The ProCon answer is what's happening. Global warming, and abortion, are both approved by ProCons. If either Pros, or Cons, waited to sacrifice to save the planet, or save the unborn, they could. Neither does, because sacrifice isn't in their deal. The economic social contract says they must work all day to get economic security. Unless they're harming economic growth (or political security), then a person is free to do whatever they want. That's why both sides value a women's right to choose, and driving a racing car, as much as ending global warming, or the unborn holocaust. It's alway why the yell and scream at the other side to sacrifice. Because neither can unless a new social contract is written. Once it is, it'll be obvious how ProCons argue over extremely minor details.

So being mixed with "extremely minor details" puts us in some pre-crisis status, like the Great Schism of 1054 or the Reformation of 1517. But, when you add our very transformative new digital technology, that puts us in a pre-revolution, like 1776 America, or 1789 France. Probably the latter, because we have so much "old DNA", old answers about global warming, abortion, health care, education etc. that the loyal ProCons want to defend.

We've been going through several economic crises. Especially with speculation and housing. I don't think it's a coincidence the French Revolution started after a financial crash, and a crisis about expensive housing. The Palace of Versailles, and other palaces, started off like our suburbia, as small cottages. Versailles cottage was built around 1500, and within a few hundred years, the palace was consuming about 25% of France's economy. The peasants were actually encouraged to take tours to see how glorious their nobility were. Which is laughable, until you see a Martha Stewart magazine today. Rousseau ironically was a butler in palace, and wrote his theories while serving dinner to divine gods. Once the political nobility lived inside palaces, wore dresses, and hosted many banquets and balls, their system was just waiting for a revolution.

I never mentioned the Bibical passages used to justify the divine rights of the nobilty. I was saving it. Because it teaches so much. Remember at first, most regular folks didn't need much convincing to follow Clovis I and Charlemagne, because they really did end the chaos. Yet, Louis XIV inside his palace? Well, he needed some trickery. Here's one important passage from Peter 2:13-20

>Servants, be submissive to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the harsh. 19 For this is commendable, if because of conscience toward God one endures grief, suffering wrongfully. 20 For what credit is it if, when you are beaten for your faults, you take it patiently? But when you do good and suffer, if you take it patiently, this is commendable before God.

This Bible passage, among several other, let the nobles turn cottages into palaces. Theologically this makes sense. Because theologically, anything can make sense.

Now compare that to this video of a current financial executive talking how he gets his fortune, and is considered divine for having it. It’s from the movie The Big Short, about the 2008 financial crisis, and the few wall street bankers who saw through the ruling philosophy, and realized Wall Street’s huge “gloire” profits gotten from trading mortgages, were based on nothing real like Charlemagne, or Carnegie gave society. Political and economic security inside castles and factories giving real life political or economic security by let people live unhindered micro-stories. Gloire was always bound to fail.

This guy is not J.P. Morgan, or Andrew Carnegie. Not even close. He likes palaces, and loves being told he's special during yet another banquet and ball. The Oscars, Cannes Film Festival, Foriegn Correspondent Dinner, Met Gallery, so many other ceremonies, that have nothing to do with taming economic anarchy. The peasantry went along with divine rights of the nobility because it at first made sense, then because they couldn't read the Latin Bible anyway. When the printing press let the Bible be printed in native languages, the peasants called bullshit all over the place. Today's economics, like the bullshit in that clip, is like theology; it justifies and rationalizes the ruling philosophy, because it no longer serves a functional contribution to life's mission of defeating evil.

We're repeating something in our backstory. The many wars of the nobility, like the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714), War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748), and the Seven Years War (1756-1763) were totally useless. Yet fought for the nobility's "gloire", that had them build their palaces, and host their banquets and balls.

The massive quest for corporate profits, stock prices that must always go up, is like the unchecked thirst for gloire that made Europe fight wars for no reason. All the titles of executive vice-president, regional manager, assistant to the regional manager, are all just titles given by the nobility to distance themselves from the reality that makes their rule past-due. Free-markets were meant to help life conquer poverty with water pumps, electricity, and computers, not build spectular palaces, increase a stock price, host an awards ceremony, or ride in helicopters.

You wonder why the ruling nobility, ProCons and corporations, took the news of Donald Trump and Brexit so hard. Because they're addicted to their ruling philosophy the same way Charles I, or Louis XVI, and George III were. Pros must use inclusiveness to bring in new customers. That's there first priority. Cons must sell more products to more people, that's there first priority.

Yet, same trend that democratized organized political power, is slowly, very slowly, starting to take hold in our economics. So while the ProCons lament Trump and Brexit for building barriers, and attacking trade, because that's bad for today's ruling philosophy, what's really happending, unknown to anyone, is a repeat of history. The first step to democratization is forming borders, like Europe did in Westphalia.

The same thing is happening to our economics. Borders give accountability. That is what the digital revolution needs to really change our world. Because digital technology is so powerful, it doesn't need to specialize and trade; which is the very basis of our ruling economic system. Think of it, why should any country specialize in the production of say DVD's, or paper, if we can stream movies, or read on a eReader. Why should we trade for Germany's great tools, if a 3D printer can print a custom tool for us. Why would a physics student from New Zealand rush over to Princeton University, if she can watch lectures online and use a few dozen GPU's for her own supercomputer. This doesn't mean we don't trade, or can't specialize, it means countries don't need to encourage companies as much, because now individual people can specialize using digital tools, and can trade with each other. Therefore, digital technology is being held back by our ruling philosophy, the same way the New Model Army was being held back by their belief in a religious ruling philosophy. Until a new philosophy came that inspired revolutions.

Which is what I hope to be. If we're economically so unready to take advantage of our technology, we're somewhere in between Machiavelli and Rousseau. We need new economic, modes and orders, effectual truth so we can see through our imagined world of ProCons. It also means we need a new social contract based on economic equality, and economic borders so enforce accountability and international compromise. That also means we're about to go through an new enlightenment, so we take really take advantage of digital technology.

Techvolution is about proactively moving into this inevitable future, and thwarting useless revolutions with foresight. But how do you know I'm not bullshitting you. If you are a devout ProCon, I don't know how to convince you. Ruling philosophies are extremely strong. Yet we change them anyway. Within a few generations Western Civilization went from being the Roman Empire, to Barbarians Kingdoms, to Feuldal Kingdoms, to massive wars between Catholics and Protestants, to huge revolutions. Doesn't that tell you, your own personal ruling philosophy is changing under your feet. So if you're a proud ProCon, when is your time to change? Why not be a protagonist, and decide yourself.

But maybe I' wrong. Maybe my analysis is wrong. There is one way to test it. I don't even ever have to meet you. Yet we can test how good our ruling philosophy is. We just ask you the question I wish someone asked Sophia when Hugh caught her teaching Douglass to read.

Are you happy?
