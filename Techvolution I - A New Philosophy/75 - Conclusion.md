how people will do what can measure, like keep the suburban home neat, or buy fashionalble clothes and cars in our consumer culture.

Now we can sense more important stuff. We can sense Techvolution, and therefore people will do it.

Like GitHub commits, Wikipedia entires, Quora contributions... just the beginning to a a new cyborg.

Maybe a Rogan intereview, to exlain each point?

EXAMPLE:

ROGAN
"I'm almost left wing on every issue"

MAJIC
"That's what i wont to eliminate, that's bullshit"

ROGAN
"why?"

MAJIC
"Do you shot guns, you do drive gas cars, do you do BJJ, do you fly around for comedy? have a family..."

ROGAN
yes

MAJIC
then that's your politics. No self-description, your actions during your politics.

ROGAN
so...

MAJIC
so now its up to you, to decide if your actions are good, and if they aren't to change them. voting blue, or red, means shit. making better choices is your political vote. changing your cyborgolgy is your vote. Techvolution gives you the freedom to choose whatever is best for you, the Life Star tells you the consequences of your actions, but only you can decide to make those choices better, **and**, now I can inside the ecosystem also choose to stop subsidizing your bad choices by making better choices and thus using better tools. And we help each other fix this damn world.
