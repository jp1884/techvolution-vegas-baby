how people will do what can measure, like keep the suburban home neat, or buy fashionalble clothes and cars in our consumer culture.

Now we can sense more important stuff. We can sense Techvolution, and therefore people will do it.

Like GitHub commits, Wikipedia entires, Quora contributions... just the beginning to a a new cyborg.

Maybe a Rogan intereview, to exlain each point?

EXAMPLE:

ROGAN
"I'm almost left wing on every issue"

MAJIC
"That's what i wont to eliminate, that's bullshit"

ROGAN
"why?"

MAJIC
"Do you shot guns, you do drive gas cars, do you do BJJ, do you fly around for comedy? have a family..."

ROGAN
yes

MAJIC
then that's your politics. No self-description, your actions during your politics.

ROGAN
so...

MAJIC
so now its up to you, to decide if your actions are good, and if they aren't to change them. voting blue, or red, means shit. making better choices is your political vote. changing your cyborgolgy is your vote. Techvolution gives you the freedom to choose whatever is best for you, the Life Star tells you the consequences of your actions, but only you can decide to make those choices better, **and**, now I can inside the ecosystem also choose to stop subsidizing your bad choices by making better choices and thus using better tools. And we help each other fix this damn world.

THE INNOVATORS

The next phase of the Digital Revolution will bring even more new methods of marrying technology with the creative industries, such as media, fashion, music, entertainment, education, literature, and the arts. Much of the first round of innovation involved pouring old wine—books, newspapers, opinion pieces, journals, songs, television shows, movies—into new digital bottles. But new platforms, services, and social networks are increasingly enabling fresh opportunities for individual imagination and collaborative creativity. Roleplaying games and interactive plays are merging with collaborative forms of storytelling and augmented realities. This interplay between technology and the arts will eventually result in completely new forms of expression and formats of media.

This innovation will come from people who are able to link beauty to engineering, humanity to technology, and poetry to processors. In other words, it will come from the spiritual heirs of Ada Lovelace, creators who can flourish where the arts intersect with the sciences and who have a rebellious sense of wonder that opens them to the beauty of both.
