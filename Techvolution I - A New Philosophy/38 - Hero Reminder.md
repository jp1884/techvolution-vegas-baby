# A Hopeless Fight, A Sure Victory

Won't make up your mind. This will help. New tools always empower the people. Antagonists arise only when they choose to resist empowering the people. The protagonists have always fought back. Connecting with a new tool with majic, changes their politics, and they want to share it. When enough extras join them, the antagonists are defeated.

The majic of digital tools is very strong. The force is strong with whoever holds it. And that's not by accidents. It's by design. The thousands of protagonists who built the internet and other digital tools, loved decentralization of power, in fact they built it into the internet from the start. And this fact means Darth Blockbuster never did, and never will, stand a chance against today's internet Jedi.

## Protagonist Paul Baran

The internet has many protagonists. Paul Baran is one of the big ones. Here's why.

The internet is a network. There are many ways of sending data through a network. The simplest is how phone systems do it, with a direct circuit link between two phones. A call's connection only stops when someone hangs up.

Alexander Graham Bell invented "direct circuit links" in 1876 and put it into action when he co-founded the American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T) in 1885. For generations direct links was how all telecommunications worked. But when the Soviets tested a hydrogen bomb in 1955, Paul Baran took it upon himself to make a new tool to help prevent a nuclear holocaust.

Baran realized to prevent nuclear war, the world needed a communications network that would survive an atomic attack. Only robust and reliable communications would ease American and Soviet trigger fingers during tense times.

Baran worked alone for years. By 1960 he came up with the two key ideas he needed. His first was that his network should have no hubs or organizations (like telephone's have) to control the flow of information. Central hubs make systems vulerable to attack or failure. Instead data flow should be completely distributed so every node can send and receive information. Baran's equal nodes network looked like a fishnet. Each node only needed three or four links to survive any attack.

Next Baran had to figure out how to send information across the network. This led to his second idea, which was to break up the data into standard-size little packets. A message would be broken into many of these packets, each of which would scurry along different paths through the network’s nodes and be reassembled when they got to their destination. This way there'd be no "dropped calls" and communication would always stay open. Baran published his ideas into detailed technical specs and made sure everyone, especially the Soviets, could copy his work.

Baran then walked into a nest of villians. When Baran's employer RAND recommended his "node-packet data network" idea to the Air Force (in control of America's nuclear missles) they wanted to build it. But when the Department of Defense got itself and the Defense Communications Agency involved Baran soon found out working with so many bureaucrats was hopeless.

So Baran tried to convince AT&T, in control of America's telephone network, to supplement their system with his node-packet data network. “They fought it tooth and nail,” he recalled. “They tried all sorts of things to stop it.” They would not even let RAND use the maps of its circuits, so Baran had to use a leaked set. He made several trips to AT&T headquarters in lower Manhattan. On one of them, a senior executive who was an old engineer looked stunned when Baran explained that his system would mean that data could go back and forth without a dedicated link remaining open. “He looked at his colleagues in the room while his eyeballs rolled up sending a signal of his utter disbelief,” according to Baran. After a pause, the executive said, “Son, here’s how a telephone works,” and explained a patronizing and simplistic description.

The Sith's metaphorical rule book Death Star became real. It was against the rules to make a reliable communication network. The rules made Earth's destruction more likely. Good thing Jedi's don't give up. Baran continued to push. AT&T finally had him and other outsiders to a series of seminars explaining how its telephone system really worked. “It took ninety-four separate speakers to describe the entire system,” Baran marveled. When it was over, the AT&T executives asked Baran, “Now do you see why packet switching wouldn’t work?” To their great disappointment, Baran simply replied, “No.”

To heck with Darth Telephone!

A decade later Baran's network was built when the US government's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) saw the wisdom in distrbuted communications network. In 1969 ARPA used Baran's technical specs to build ARPAnet, the first version of the our internet, and so did the Soviets. Except the Soviet Union only made it for its military. The people never even knew about it. No surprise the Soviet Union fell in 1991.

Baran's network is why our internet, smartphones, apps always empower individuals. In the DNA of the interent is a distributed node network that nobody can control or shutdown. An individual has the exact same access as any corporation or government.

That's why the internet is majical. It empowers people by default. It's why Darth Blockbuster never had a chance. And never will. Now please tell me, why Darth Blockbuster is so moral and just, the he deserves to hold back this invention?

Techvolution is to be the first explicit philosophy of the internet and other new tools. It's a phiilosophy to distribute the power of new tools, because our new tools were made to distribute power. So let Obi-Wan go!
