# Magic Connections Make Stories

First dates are amazing. Even the generic dinner and movie ones are wondrous. Sitting there in your nice sweater, eating a medium steak, sipping water, and across from you is a stem-cell. What the fuck? Yep. Stem-cell. She, (or he), could be your Juliette. This moment might start a story where in a few days, you might pay your soul to prevent even a frown on this stranger's heavenly face. Such is the power of romances.

Or this moment might end with a five year divorce with true accusations of infidelity where you eat beans for breakfast, bitters for lunch and dinner, and see your kids once a week. Your own offspring thinking you're a stranger because of this demon. Such is the power of tragedies.

In truth, most stories are somewhere in between two extremes; but that's beside the point. The point is every story starts with a connection. If human life is a tapestry of stories, both grand and small, we have to understand how we make and keep people connected to their stories.

It's question of reason. A connection is made when a story is on the borderline. One that is unexpected enough to be interesting, yet reasonable enough to be understood. People, viewers, readers, don't have to be conscious of every element. A good story takes a person over. That's why we often loose ourselves to the romance or the tragies.

So to get someone connected to a story, we must make them happy. Easy enough. Everyone likes happiness.

That's easy to know, hard to achieve. Your Juliette could think your a loser. Your Romeo might be ignoring your text messages. The point is we can't make happiness, we can't force a connection. Happiness is a magical connection between you, and a person, product, achievement, leader, or society, that forces a person to stay inside a story.

Happy stories are magical. So the question is, are you happy with yours?

## It's Not Changing

You read about King Charles I. The king who died rather than apologize. We're using King Charles to showcase how nobles couldn't understand any objections to their rule because they didn't understand their role in the story of life has a natural conclusion.

Meaning, once peace and security returned to western Europe, the nobility's storyline ended. Thus, the nobility should have proactively done what Rousseau said, and return to being equal members of society. They didn't of course. And history used many violent revolutions to right that wrong.

Charles had a speech impediment. Often called a stammer or studder. No one then, or even now, understands what causes it. It's like a gremlin holding an electrical cord connecting your thoughts and your tongue; sometimes the electricity flows, and sometimes it doesn't. In practice this means some words are easy to say, some are hard, and some decide which at the last millisecond. Smooth talking requires agility as the speaker has to manuever around this path of uncertainty.

Hello, my ~~name~~ I go by John-ne. I wa-want to help ~~master~~ destroy revolutions. I've been ~~writ~~ trying to write this book for ~~about~~ a ~~year~~ six months...

The prospect of talking, accept to yourself and your dog, causes huge anxiety as you can imagine.

I know this because luckily enough (kidding) I have the same affliction as King Charles. Ironically it was the reason I got a job in a car insurance claim department. After a Vice President at an old company secretly told my supervisor I wasn't allowed to talk to customers, for fear of embarrasing the company, I was like shit I guess I don't have this damn thing under control.

I wasn't even that mad about it (although I was that they were not upfront). I never told anyone I had the impediment, so it obviously was an problem.

So fuck it. Jump into the deep end and sick or swim. Car insurance claim call-centre was like the Olympic trails for a stutterer, so I jumped in. Huge emotions, all day phone calls, customer service expectations, no "outs" like swear words or wonky behavior to hide behind.

And it was far worse then I thought. The company would ring a "bell" all day because... I don't know, to de-sensitize us to customers pleas for more money, or to bully us. Either way, DING-DING-DING-DING all day. No apps. No machine learning. No ideas but a motherfucking bell that gave people who weren't stutteres huge anxiety, breakdowns, and sick leaves. We were bullied in other ways, but the worst was only being given given fax machines, email, and voicemail to coordinate 200 plus car accident files at the same time.

Shock speech therapy!  After about a year I didn't have to massage my jaw at night, to release it from all the jaw-clenches I did to divert vocal stuttering. I was cured!

The point is this. That's what I took for me to mostly now, never really stutter. It's like night and day. A hidden personality was fostered and frankly is fun to be. Yet Charles never had this lesson. He was famoulsy shy, quiet, and anxious because that's the personality _it_ superimposes onto you. Even when fighting 10 years of war Charles still probably had to massage his strained jaws after work every night.

Yet, when on trial for his life, Charles did not stutter. Oliver Cromwell, a Napoleon like figure except he was a religious puritan, led the trial against Charles for "crimes against the English people". Cromwell said the nobles didn't have a "divine right to rule". Charles wasn't pretending to not understand. He wasn't proud, or stubborn. He pyschologically couldn't understand. He was so sure of himself, he bypassed the gremlin spoke in such elegant words many people were impressed.

Charles spoke clearly because he believed in something. He was wrong, dead wrong. Pun intended. His and his peers ignorance caused so much destruction we'll be studying it for centuries. Yet he still believed in making a better society. He died believing in it.

## It's Your Story, What Do You Think

And now we get to you. The reader. The person inside the woven tapestry of technological creation. The grand story of our ancestors was taming security by making nobility divine; ours has been taming poverty by making private property divine, and your individual life is somewhere inside there. Remember while it's okay to be little confused by a story while you're watching it, we also must understand its reason when looking back at it.

Looking back at your day, year, life, do you see the reason inside the story of your life? To have a techvolution means we have to understand the ruling philosophy, and the technological development that will someday discredit that philosophy. Defining our ruling philsophy is easy enough. Knowing when our woven tapestry of technological development discredits our ruling philosophy is easy in retrospect. Yet what about when we are inside the story right now.

Good thing we can feel the answer. It's the same feel that the people had when they sang:

>When the beating of your heart
Echo’s the beating of the drums
There is a life about to start
When tomorrow comes!

Our ancestors felt their ruling philosophy had to go. They felt it in their lives because they could not see the reason inside their own stories anymore. The could fell they had to jump to a new story. A new chapter in the story of humanity where people live free, but work together to conquer poverty. We know now that technology had disabled the need for political nobility. Yet for them, they could just feel the lure of freedom and could do nothing but fight for it.

What about you now, in your life. Is it obvious to you, as a character in the story, why you live the life you do. Let's find out how can you might tell.

Your spend most of your life going to, sitting at your place of work. When you're there, do you feel like you're helping society?  Do you see the reason for spending your life at work?  Or do you see chains keeping you from a better life. That question started the French Revolution. And now you need to answer it before we have our own.

## Think Carefully

When you're asked are you happy, please don't think things will change or get better. No matter what happens, today's nobility will not change themselves. You can try to sell modern technology to a old bureaucracy or corporation to see it. But here's a easier, and more drastic way to tell just how convinced we all get into our stories.

You read about King Charles I. The king who died rather than apologize. We're using King Charles to showcase how nobles couldn't understand any objections to their rule because they didn't understand their role in the story of life had a natural conclusion. 

Meaning, once peace and security returned to western Europe, the nobility's storyline ended. Thus, the nobility should have proactively done what Rousseau said, and return to being equal members of society. They didn't of course. And history used many violent revolutions to right that wrong.

The prospect of talking, accept to yourself and a dog, causes huge anxiety as you can imagine. _The King's Speech_ show it all well enough.

I know this because luckily enough (kidding) I have the same affliction as King Charles. Ironically it was the reason I got a job in a car insurance claim department. After a Vice President at an old company secretly told my supervisor I wasn't allowed to talk to customers, for fear of embarrasing the company, I was like shit I guess I don't have this damn thing under control. I wasn't even that mad about it (although I was that they were not upfront). I never told anyone I had the impediment, so it obviously was an problem.

The point is this. That's what I took for me to mostly now, never really stutter. It's like night and day. A hidden personality was fostered and frankly is fun to be. Yet Charles never had this lesson. He was famoulsy shy, quiet, and anxious his whole life because that's the personality _it_ superimposes onto you. Even when fighting 10 years of war Charles still probably had to massage his strained jaws after work every night.

Yet, when on trial for his life, Charles did not stutter. Oliver Cromwell, a Napoleon like figure except he was a religious puritan, led the trial against Charles for "crimes against the English people". Cromwell said the nobles didn't have a "divine right to rule". Charles wasn't pretending to not understand. He wasn't proud, or stubborn. He pyschologically couldn't understand. He was so sure of himself, he bypassed the gremlin spoke in such elegant words many people, even those who hated him, were impressed.

Charles spoke clearly because he believed in something. He was wrong, dead wrong. Pun intended. His and his peers ignorance caused so much destruction we'll be studying it for centuries. Yet he still believed in making a better society. He died believing in it while speaking his last words without a hint of a stutter.

So when you answer the question, are you happy today, imagine yourself, and your kids, living like today for the rest of their lives. Otherwise, the ruling philosophy will never change until one day, we hit a revolution.

This liberal philosophy of individuality is promoted and defended in all our institutions. Classrooms teach an individual's human and property rights are hallowed. Boardrooms figure out how to indulge our wants with products like faster cars or bigger homes. News broadcasters tell us how good the economy is when we all indulge. They even have benchmarks like Gross Domestic Product and stock prices. Progressives vigoursly fight for individual rights like marriage or minority rights. Conservatives do the same thing for property and gun rights. And many of the stories we watch promote all this individuality. When was the last time you saw a story about political compromise, or what would happen if America restarted the military draft, or the self-sacrifice of a gay man staying in the closet to keep his family together.

I like to think Western Rome, after starting it's story in 8th Century BC, was just tired. It had gone through so many different ruling philosophies, first with kings, then republics with consuls, senates, and tribues, then back to viritual kings called emperors. Rome warred constantly, with themselves in dozens of civil wars, and with countless tribes and empires. They integrated countless people's and beliefs into their ruling philosophy. Rome went from their own pagan religion, to adopting the Greek mythology, to changing their founding story to be the Trojans, before adopting a pacifist cult called Christianity as a state religion.

They did all this while building a civilization we still envy today. Rome's cities, agriculture, commerce, aquaducts, buildings, literature, military, and politics still give us many lessons. Alas, it was a series of grand stories from Romulus, Pompey Magnus, Julius Caesar, Cleopatra, and Jesus Christ, to so many more.

Maybe Rome just wanted a conclusion. After nearly 1,500 years of working at it, there was no more ways to adapt its ruling philosophy again, and motivate its characters to act inside yet another grand story. I personal get the sense that if they'd discovered more of the world, they might have been excited by the adventure of exploring it. But as it was, Rome's story had been in the same setting for thousands of years. What other story was there to live? And so the Roman people/characters slowly didn't bother, and let backward barbarians take over. This is only an impression of mine. Rome needed the New World, like we need Mars.

Our real life stories are very confusing. We're often like Sophie not sure which what is right or wrong. Is humanity naturally good, but corrupted by society. Or is humanity naturally corrupted and saved by society. That question, in many variations, consumes lots of thinking

I think the answer is how we solve problems. We only ever solve a problem with technology. A story about being lost, oppressed, and hungry, is only solved with technologies like compasses, reading, and farming. I use technology as a catchall term for any tool, be it material like a bucket, structural like a building, or biological like a hand, or mental like reading, that life uses to solve a problem.

Life makes us solve problems as it fights off death. And to solve problems we invent technology. Everytime we overcome a problem with technology, life wins. My problem is how do we learn to master revolutions. and for that i want to tell you a story.

And this is the story of humanity, and of this book. How do we spread technology, and learn...

Need to factor in revolutions...

That's the power of stories. No matter their size, they can change the world by giving us information in a easy to understand way. A story is a person solving a problem through a series of events that are ordered into a beginning, middle, and end. We always know what's happening and why. That's why we kids to seniors love stories. It's a way to get, and give, knowledge.

Naturally good if free from calamity. Or bad, as the husband showed. Ruling philosophy doesn't help.

First let's look at the lessons. Unless we're facing starvation, or some calamity, many people will be good like Sophie was. Life wants us to help each other, because that only helps life survive. Yet, freedom can't alway be good. The husband was free and he used it to enslave others.

The ruling philosophy is no help either. Most people will follow the rules with the rest of the crowd. While dissenters will often dissent for the sack of it. Thus, during a person's life, there's still no way to know if following or dissenting, is good or evil.

Plots don't help. If you told this story in the Southern States, in 1842, Sophie would have been a bad person turned good. If you told it in England, she'd be a good person turned bad.

Inside the stories of our lives, we thus can't always trust our personal instincts, the instincts of society, or the events of our lives, to tell us what's good or evil. This confusion makes it easy to believe good and evil doesn't even exist. Or to constantly be surprised.

Image yourself Sophie, following Frederick as grew to worldwide fame. She went from being good and evil, several times as America kept changing it's definitions. What was she, as a honest person trying to be good, to do? People are often left adrift looking for answers.

Gladly, life is a grand story with certainty. Life knows what's good and evil. Life is good, death is evil. To fight against death, life can't rely on characters, or plots, because both have no inherent goodness. So how does life free us to our natural goodness, without the assholes messing it up?

Sophie may not have always been good. She didn't dissent when she should have. But she still _did_ good when she taught Frederick to read. And that's life answer to the uncertainty of good and bad inside characters and plots.

Technology is always good.

Many people were made slaves because of words. Many people make themselves slaves with the words they read.
Nobody was ever made free with ignorance. Technology is the manifestation of life inside a lifeform, or object used to help life survive death.

And this is the story of humanity, and of this book. How do we spread technology, and learn...

Need to factor in revolutions...

Douglass relatively liked living in Sophie's house. He didn't want to go back to the Maryland farm. And he feared going to the huge plantations in the Deep South. Why? He was owned under contract of property in all three areas. Why did slavery have levels of evil? Proximity. Living with people, working in small farms, and slaving away in huge plantations meant owner and slave experience each other differently. Proximity to evil, meant more interactions to force out the good. Thus, even though the ruling story of every area allowed slavery, life broke through the closer two people actually touched. This is why uneducated outsiders like Sophie, and young kids, taught Frederick to read.

Now who do you think the people who farmed your coffee, made your fancy car would think is the protagonist and antagonist? Do you appreciate the extra effort making another disposal cup, or adding leather to a steering wheel as if the person was right beside you?

Fine, it's not your fault the global supply chain is fucked up. You probably own stock in some of the large companies, but I'll concede most people don't want to be Darth Vader. That's why we buy fair trade coffee, and drive electric cars.

What about your workplace. Do you think the future you, reading this in Star Trek, will envy your 9-5, with an hour drive in good weather, dealing with asshole customers, paying for a house you can't afford, working for one of our many Blockbusters with unknown bosses who can't even play a DVD. Try and better yourself like Douglass did, make an app, and see how the bosses at Blockbuster respond.

You can't say the past is evil, while being like Sophie and accepting the present ruling philosophy is good. The ruling philosophy, the definitions of good and evil inside our society, are not dependable. They change inside every microstory. Some are better then others for sure. But life doesn't work it's magic there. Life always needs to fight evil. So this is how it always does.

## Catch and Release

One day, many workers from another department were asked to visit a hotel. Hundreds of people filtered in, and were directed to the conference room. Actually two conference rooms; either #101 or #102. Each room had water bottles and snacks. Yet why two rooms? Friends in each were texting back and forth, comparing, trying to spot the differences that might reveal the reason for their divide.

About 45 minutes later, Human Resources representatives appear. One group in each room. One says "you all have jobs", while the other says "as we all know, technology is advancing greatly, and this inevitably means automating lots of jobs. Like Netflix, we all love Netflix don't we, well unfortunately...". A mass firing of front-line workers.

It hit so hard, we adjusters felt it. Especially since it kept happening. The supervisors felt the bern. The SNAP-SNAP-SNAP-SNAP got a little faster. Everyone got extra hooked on being sure they'd pay the rent.

===

## Skywalker Prologuee

Seriously. Let me explain. Life needs us to fight off death by solving problems like disease, hunger, ignorance, and barbarism. Life gets what it needs, by making us live stories; because stories are about a hero character (you) solving a problem through a series of events inside of a plot. Each story has a protagonist, and antagoninst, Luke Skywalker, and Darth Vader, battling for their version of good, against the other side's evil.

When _we_ write the story, it's easy to know which side is which; that Skywalker is the hero, and Darth Vader and his Death Star space station are evil. Imagine if _Star Wars_ showed the families of the "bad guys" on the Death Star that Luke Skywalker blows up. Millions of families suffered so many hooks, yet the audience celebrates because a few thousand rebel "heroes" were saved. Because we humans wrote the story, we can slant it that way.

Yet in real life, we are not writers. We can't control anything but our characters. We can define evil within our own micro-stories. But to answer the general question "what is evil" is impossible because in the grand story of life, all of it, we're always just a character living micro-stories.

With so many lifeforms, living so many stories, who's to say what's best for life? Maybe we can collect many stories into a decent definition of "good and evil", yet no human written story like a religion or ideology will capture all of life's good and evils. There's too many contractions. It would be like Luke Skywalker commenting on a romantic comedy, mystery murder, and a coming of age movie, and expecting to be the hero in all stories. Skywalker is only the hero in _Star Wars_. Maybe he's a jerk boyfriend, or bad witness, cheated on his school exams, or just an extra.

===

## Hooks

Writers call your first impression on a story, "the hook". If it's memorable it's called the hook. If it sucks it's called forgotten. When I got a new job answering phone calls and processing car insurance claims for people, it sucked. But a job's a job, and I was hooked on paying the rent.

People has a double meaning. People, as in the people who paid thousands of dollars in case they needed much more after a car crash. And people, as in the corporation that took the people's money, promising to return it if needed. My job was claims adjuster, a sort of guardian of the people's money. You talk with customers, get their accident details, verify their account is active, get repair estimates, and send the check. The job was kinda like a bank teller, or Blockbuster rep; mostly talking with customers, doing paperwork, managing long queues, and working business hours. The job of adjusting hadn't changed much since the 1980's.

One constant hiccup was getting the details. People don't call claim departments with happy stories; it's often ones filled with hooks about crashes, robberies, and broken bodies. One day a coworker answered a call; car crash, followed by a car fire. The customer was stuck inside. Double hook.

His wife Jane Doe called in, with no idea what... what... what does anything mean anymore. Unlike 911 calls, people aren't frantic. They've had time to consider everything. They need guidance to understand so many hooks. Often adjusters were just shoulders. Adjusters quickly learn to throw away the mandatory talking points and just talk like a real person.

With 40 phone calls a day, dozens of faxes and emails, we processed hundreds of claims a week. You get used to the complaints about long hold times, or high insurance rates, but evil stories hook you too. So when our coworker was done with the call, we all looked at her with empathy. Now she needed someone else to take the hook off her shoulders, and...

BEEP!... BEEP!... BEEP!... BEEP!... BEEP!... The supervisor was ringing his bell, what he used to tell us "get back to work, answer more phone calls!". Lots of customers were waiting. The insurance company sells a contract. It's the front-line workers, adjusters, job to be the ones to honour that contract, and deal with whatever hooks we get. We just had to hurry up about it, and answer more phone calls, send more faxes. Like Blockbuster, we had to be sure customers could access their DVD's when we wanted them to.

## Wikipedia

Wikipedia lets anyone start and edit an article. You know about Galileo using his telescope to change the world, contribute what you know. Because Wikipedia's software tracks every change, graffiti is erased faster than vandals can make it. The result is an ever growing "the sum of all human knowledge." In a common trend of the internet, technology now lets millions of the people contribute small bits of work, to make a massive whole. Linux, Andriod, Firefox, Ruby on Rails, Deno, Wikipedia, and so much other cool stuff is made by faceless people, avilable for free, because so many people are hooked on being a protagonists contributing to a good cause.

Of course this is in contrast to Blockbuster. The DVD is a one way street. It makes people extras, having to pay, and be regulated, by the gatekeepers we called Blockbuster. Wikipedia is a two street. It fosters collaboration.

But who should be allowed to make a Wikipedia entry? I think everyone but short people. They usually have chips on their shoulders. Which is ironic because they're so close to the ground. If you defend them, remember Wikipedia is the "sum of all human knowledge", how much can short people really add?

This may seem ridicules, but a generation ago, contributing what you knew wasn't done in a click. It was years of trials before esteemed judges with long names like Distinguished Chair of Knowledge, Professor Emeritus George Doe of The University of Loans. The sum of all human knowledge was held behind walls at Blockbuster, called Enclyopia Britannica, or Oxford Dictionary. Only university graduates would be approved to work there. The poor, minorities, unlucky, sick, or maybe even short people could be easily excluded. After all, the institutions made their own rules. They had their own BEEP! with due dates, required readings, and fierce competition to rise into the hierarchy of esteem.

Wikipedia's first version was supposed to mobilize these experts. It was called Nupedia and had all the features of Wikipedia. In it's first year Wikipedia had forty thousand articles. Nupedia 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11...12.

Thousands of universities, professors, students, spending hundreds of millions dollars had the opportunity to give the world their knowledge, and they didn't. I was at an "elite university" then, studying the history and political philosophy of technological changes. The greatest lesson I got was seeing Wikipedia openly mocked for not being elitist. Professors were like the priests who rejected Galileo _because_ his telescope made knowledge easier to understand.

Blockbuster vs. Netflix. Universities vs Wikipedia. Taxis vs Uber. Hotels vs AirBnB. Insurance companies vs. Somebody Soon. There is something else going on. Every new transformative technology has a antagonist. Why are new and better technologies getting attacked. Professors, business owners, priests, managers, are hooked to using old technology, yet masked it with prestige built up from being gatekeepers. Protagonists, antagonists, battling for control of the grandstory of our civilizations.

And the extras stuck in the middle trying to pick a side.

## Who Are The People

Wikipedia isn't perfect. But when a person wants to learn something, Wikipedia, or Khan Academy, Udemy, or YouTube, is very likely good enough. They're usually almost free. We can pick what we need to know. And our success depends on learning the solution to the problem that had us looking for help. No grades, no admissions test.

In contrasts, universities, while still doing some really good work, are so much like Blockbuster. Needed and used until better technology like Wikipedia or Netflix comes along.

The point is, have we learned that lesson. I mean, if you write, edit, curate 20 Wikipedia articles, that are read by millions of people, is there even a word for that like "university gradute"? Will you get a job because of your contribution?

Anonymous contributions worked good enough Wikiepdia. It's worked in other places in society. Anyone can upload a YouTube video, make something for sale on Etsy, upload computer software to GitHub. Services like Uber, and AirBnB now help people get paid for using their own property differently. We're empowering anyone to be protagonist with modern technology and contribute what they can. Or are we?

Because whilst at work, I got sick of all those hooks, and all those BEEPS!. So I had an edit to make, and how many people know about car claims adjusting. So why not contribute an upgrade.

So, what if we didn't pretend it was 1980's anymore? Maybe we could make the claims department work faster, and thereby help everyone. My contribution was suggesting we stopped using fax machines. Because thousands of times a week we faxed documents to other insurance companies. Why not go online?

The answer from the experts was the same as Nupedia, Blockbuster, a definitive no. Actually it wasn't a no. It was a review process that never ended. An unconscious allergy to new technology, hidden behind the prestige of old technology.

## Your Hook Into Wikipedia

And this is where you and I, as members of the same society, have a hook inside the same story. What happens next? I have this helpful contribution, that maybe a thousand adjusters would use. But it would help hundreds of thousands of drivers after a crash.

Yet that edit could't be made. It was refused by the experts. I'm not here to argue about my job. You ever use a fax machine 10 times a day? That says enough. The outrage is realixing how often this shit is  happening.

Inside our economy we're called customers and workers. We're told to be extras each time, there to service the. But really we're collaboraters. I, the adjuster, and talking with Jane Doe after her husband died. She needs to access her own (insurance) money, and needs my help to get it. What the fuck are the experts there for if we can just look up answers on Wikipedia, or stream the movie from Netflix.

No big deal? My little app idea, extremely simple, dead simple using code freely available on GitHub, in one year would save 2.25 million phone calls, 12 million minutes of waiting on hold, 100,000 of unpaid adjuster overtime hours, and 100 million insurance dollars. Even better, we'd start making a database of all insurance claims. So we could start learning, and therefore preventing, why crashes, and car fires, happen. Amazingly something so simple isn't already done. It would help so much. Instead I heard silence, and of course BEEP-BEEP-BEEP.

I always had a hobby of writing politcal philosophy since leaving university. Specifically, the politics of the share economy. I was gonna release it in short bursts I hoped a few hundred might read. Fuck it. People are literally dying in car crashes every day, getting burned alive inside their own property, and I'm getting BEEP-BEEP-BEEP by experts who want to pretend it's 1980. The Blockbuster economy refuses, like the religious priests of old who refused to look through Galileo's telescope, to update to new technology. Their ignorance inspires revolutions.

This book is my contribution to that bullshit. I'm hooked to it.

## Happy Netflix Customers, Happy Blockbuster Employees

The divide between closed access DVD technology, to open access internet technology defines the divide between happy and unhappy. Because for the vast majority of our economy, we still work at, and use the Blockbuster way of life. Although increasingly the masses know the Netflix way of life is possible.

To be fair everyone resists upgrading _their_ job. There's a phenomenom of "I want to work at Blockbuster, and I want to use Netflix" in our society. Lots of people want to keep getting paid for the Blockbuster fees, while having to pay the Netflix costs. This happens because there is no official plan to transition to the Digital Age, Netflix economy. Thus people working at the Blockbuster's throughout our economy are scared.

Practically speaking what can the average person do. Most people don't, and will never work at "Netflix". Netflix is so cheap and efficient because it doesn't need much manual labour like stocking shelves, managers to open and close stores, HR reps to do the intake forms for new employees, and executives doing deals with their piers over whatever. No lobbyists to lower minimum wage, no unions to fight against it, activists to protest the smog from deliver trucks. Still, how does the middle class, who likely works for the  ruling nobility, pay their bills while building the Netflix economy of the future?

Good thing we don't have too. The player god doesn't wait for anyone. He keeps playing the game. Thus, just like Netflix, the Netflix economy already exists. We just need a new Digital Age philosophy card to click we'll democratization of our functions like insurance, news, and politics.

### Romeo and Juliette Triangle

![Romeo and Juliette](img\ch1\triangle-baking.png)
**Romeo and Juliette:** Two great families really don't like each other. The feud is like boozing to an alcoholic, no purpose but it feels great anyway. The feud goes on until two youngsters catch each other's eyes across the battle line. The setting is wealthy Renaissance Italy. The passions are hatred contrasted by love. Dialogue reinforces the us versus them dynamic, and especially the love story. The antagonist is both family's tradition of hatred. Thought is mindless hatred juxtaposed by soulful love. Two kid protagonists rise above and risk everything for their passion. Love winds up killing them but also the feud that kept them apart.

## THE STORY OF GEO AND HELIO

So that is story. We live stories whenever encountering, dealing with, and solving problems. Since the middle class live problems everyday, we often live inside a story. Thus by understanding stories we can understand our reality. We don't have proof of that yet. I'm saying stories are a lens into human reality, that's quite a statement, but there's no technology to show you. No telescope. It's like when Friar Bruno told people the truth about the solar system, he just had reasoning; the rationality of irrationality. So let's make the telescope into our reality. A piece of technology that shows us the moons of Jupiter. Let's use a story we already know. The one between geocentrism and heliocentrism.

Let's set the stage. The Renaissance.

The Renaissance was a cultural movement that profoundly affected European intellectual life in the early modern period. Beginning in Italy, and spreading to the rest of Europe by the 16th century, its influence was felt in literature, philosophy, art, music, politics, science, religion, and other aspects of intellectual inquiry. Renaissance scholars employed the humanist method in study, and searched for realism and human emotion in art.

Renaissance humanists sought out in Europe's texts of Antiquity, while the Fall of Constantinople (1453) generated a wave of émigré Greek scholars bringing precious manuscripts in ancient Greek, many of which had fallen into obscurity in the West.

Renassaince artists strove to portray the human form realistically, developing techniques to render perspective and light more naturally. Political philosophers, most famously Niccolò Machiavelli, sought to describe political life as it really was, that is to understand it rationally. A critical contribution to Italian Renaissance humanism Giovanni Pico della Mirandola wrote the famous text "De hominis dignitate" (Oration on the Dignity of Man, 1486), which consists of a series of theses on philosophy, natural thought, faith and magic defended against any opponent on the grounds of reason. In addition to studying classical Latin and Greek, Renaissance authors also began increasingly to use vernacular languages; combined with the introduction of printing, this would allow many more people access to books, especially the Bible.

We need a protagonist. Let's use Bruno. Copernicus and Galileo are famous enough. Bruno's life could fill volumes. He was a protagonist in every sense of the word. He rose above the predominiate thought; Aristotialn and Christian theology. Born in 1548 he became a priest in 1572, studied theology in a monastary, getting his doctrate in 1575. He was investigated for his controversial views, and was soon frustrated enough to fle his monastic order in 1576. He was excommunicated and spent the next 16 years travelling western Europe.

Bruno was poor. He worked at a printer, he taught Latin, and did what he needed to make ends meet. He wanted to teach philosophy at a University. He did for a few years before Protestants kicked him out. He was a known rebel anyway which probably didn't help getting hired. He was smart and caring, but had a hard time getting passed the interview. He wouldn't wear the mask of professionalism others could with ease. That's probably why all three major  western religions, Catholics, Calvinsits, and Lutherans, all excommunicated him. That's like the USA, the Soviet Union, and Iran all hating you. Can you think of anyone today with that achievement?

If you met Bruno you'd know why he's so distinguished. He wasn't easy to deal with. Ever talk to a homeless man? Not the one having a good time on drugs or the one drifting from place to place until he grows up. The quiet guy who walks around a lot, probably keeps a pet, could use a shower and haircut if he could stop to look at himself. But he doesn't care about what he looks like. He's too busy thinking about his own world. Thus, he's a perfectly nice person, means harm to no one. Content with himself. Never wanted to interview anyone. Never wanted to be interviewed. That fake world of masks, pretension, and manners is boring. It's not real. And whatever you bribe him with won't be enough because the homeless man won't even look at your material rewards. Fake is fake, and his unique reality is more interesting. So walk around he does, thinking of reality that only he knows. He loves when you agree with him, but he can't get many people to understand because can't describe it to you exactly. His reality just fits him so well he doesn't know how to explain it. So he doesn't. A perfectly nice person.

Until you take him out of that reality. Until you tell him that reality isn't real. That in fact he's living the lie. That he should change. Then you'll see the nice man become a guardian and defend his reality like a parent defending a child. All he has in the world shall not be taken away. No moderation is possible. Stubborn, asshole, foolish, crazy, many names label that man. It's best to leave the man alone, let him be, and let him live.

If you've ever talked to someone like that, if that sounds familiar, then you've talked to Friar Bruno. The difference is Bruno didn't have a unique reality in his head he was happy to live within. He had a reality in his head he demanded others live in. That's why Bruno's life wasn't spent walking around Naples, minding his own business. It was spent writing, lecturing, debating everyone and everything in all of western civilization. He pissed off everyone. Bruno was kind of right, but we remember him more because he was the tip of the spear.

Here's why.

He had constant realizations of a new reality in his head. He struggled to make the reality in his head real for everyone else. He suffered during his journey. He was rewarded with publications and fame, and punished with scorn and infamy. His life was a drama. He never gave up. Many people were his antagonists. Occasionally regular people with their stubborn beliefs, but usually it was high ranking clergy and political leaders who attacked him, usually with dialogue in spoken threats or written condemnations.

He used dialogue to fight for his reality. Writing many books, having many debates, giving many lectures, and finally a trial for his life. He had great passions, and he used tools of pen and paper, writing and speech to interface with the world he wanted to change.

Bruno's life had a plot, a beginning, middle, and end. An end point that controlled everything else inside. Convince the world of something he could never prove. Bruno wanted to create, or destroy, a Death Star that didn't exist yet. Bruno needed the telescope to prove himself. The absence of a telescope make his personal story a tragedy. He could never have won. He never stood a chance. Yet his mental story was a full blown victory. He is a protagonist of history.

Bruno's life was a functional story. He too wondered about reality like Neo in _The Matrix_. He received variations from the infinite Universe and compiled them in his head. He saw an error in the typical thought in his day.

The lessons is many. Bruno didn't have one story, one antagonist, one realization, or one suffering. He's life was complex, varied. Life isn't a single story, but hundreds of simultaneous stories. Yet each is still just a story. Some are art, spectacle, and functional.

Even more fun is the size of story. Or the length. Some stories can be told in real-time, some are about days, weeks, or years. And some can be about generations and even epochs. So to do the stories of real life. Because our stories are inside these varied time frames. Some conclusions impactful, some almost meaingless. Sometimes we learnt the lesson, sometimes we can't find meaning in our lives like so many audiences of art films.

## STORIES GLUE THE LEVIATHAN TOGETHER

The above are Aristotle's story elements. They make up stories like atoms make up elements. Now we have to use these tools, to understand our real lives. Let's start if off when

You might have noticed something interesting.

Each step has more meaning behind it. The first steps are somewhat superficial. For example it's easy to take a picture of an item or someone using an item. Now try taking a picture for rules, antagonist, thought, protagonist, plot and it gets progressively harder. The story elements get less material and more meaningful. The reader must be conscious of the story for each level's picture to make sense.

![Consciousness](img\ch1\story-triangle-consciouness.png)

So stories are compacted consciousness. Thus if a story is well told, and especially if it's an archetypal story, as we experience stories, we share consciousness. That's why stories are the way in which society's community about their ruling philosophy.

You really need to be consciouness of the story to understand higher levels. So lower levels are material, and get more immaterial with each step. That's why plot is vital, the sequence of events gives higher purpose to items and people who themselves don't mean much.

[![Characters with plot vs no plot](http://img.youtube.com/vi/https://youtu.be/FxKtZmQgxrI?t=406/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/FxKtZmQgxrI?t=406)
_Star Wars (1977-1983) contrasted with Star Wars (1999-2005). The original movies were well told. The characters lived inside a healthy plot. The new movies are not well told. Characters don't have a plot to give them life. They have less consciousness. You can see the difference in this nice breakdown._

So, what's above plot? What's more immaterial then plot? Look again to consciousness.

Here we come back to the archetypal stories. In each archetypal story there's a higher purpose. Like Cinderella fighting to go from rags to riches, Frodo's journey to destroy the evil ring in the _Lord of the Rings_, or the moral rebirth of Scrooge in _The Christmas Carol_. Archetypal stories exist because they're so like our real lives. Life inspires fiction and fiction inspires life. There's a reinforcing cycle. You've been the hero of your own movie many times. You've been the hero of other people's lives too. We are often motivated by archetypal stories. The thing that inspires fiction and real life is, life. Life is the thing about plot in every story.

## Conclusions are black holes

Conclusions are our black holes. A back hole is so powerful both physical worlds of gravity and quantum mechanics co-exist. Since functional plots are a reasonable course of events they are like gravity; reasonable and predictable. Functional characters act with reasonably understood emotions, so are comparable to the somewhat understood world of quantum mechanics. This analogy helps understand conclusions are like black holes. A place so powerful both reason/plot, and emotion/character co-exist with shared importance. Inside our black holes we have the creation of new realities, but only when Aristotle's story elements are aligned inside a functional story.

Why do protagonists care so much? Luke Skywalker was one kid on a farm, what are the chances he'd make a difference fighting an evil galactic empire? Romeo and Juliette were like 15, and they died for each other? Was Neo's life of solitude and poverty inside the Matrix worth it to find out he's a slave? The answer is yes, it's why we remember their names.

We love these protagonists because they're archetypes. Fiction inspires real life protagonists, and real life inspires fictional protagonists. Both real and fake archetypes want to make the world a better place. That means overcoming problems inside a functional story.

Functional stories come from our eternal need solve problems. That's why spectacle and art stories never reach archetypal status. Spectalce and art are inspired by humanity to serve their passions. Only function serves a higher purpose of questioning our reality to make the world a better place. We venerate archetypes to inspire us to do the right thing. We need to connect with the consciousness of those who solved our problems before us. A time when the items, passions, dialogue, antagonists, and thoughts were different, but the plot was the same. Solve problems, defeat the bad guys on the way to a better life.

![Super-plot](img\ch1\story-protagonist-higher-calling.png)
_A person moves from item to a protagonist when they ignore all existing story elements and get inspired by a higher calling._

I like to think our soul drives us forward, but you can fill in any other kind of higher calling you like. Whatever it is, a higher calling inspires protagonists to make reality a better place to live.

We love these protagonists because they're heroes. Fiction inspires real life protagonists, and real life inspires fictional protagonists. Both real and fake heroes want to make the world a better place. That means overcoming problems inside a functional story.

Functional stories come from our eternal need solve problems. That's why spectacle and art stories never make history status. Spectalce and art are inspired by humanity to serve their passions. Only function serves a higher purpose of questioning our reality to make the world a better place. We venerate heroes to inspire us to do the right thing. We need to connect with the consciousness of those who solved our problems before us. A time when the items, passions, dialogue, antagonists, and thoughts were different, but the plot was the same. Solve problems, defeat the bad guys on the way to a better life.

## Camels in the Amazon

Now let's put humanity inside life's evolution. You might have noticed some similators. We mimick life's evolution with our technology. And our dreams are visions of the adaptions we need to make real, through our own microstories.

Now I were to show you a desert fox in the Artic, a dolphin in a pond, or a camel in the Amaxon you'd automatically see something wrong. Not with the lifeform, we take our kids to visit all of them in the zoo, but you'd see something wrong with the mixing of a lifeform into a foreign ecosystem.

Now I were to show you daily newspapers in England, gasoline cars in China, or McMansions in America, what would you think? Nothing, despite England have few paper mills, China no oil fields, or Americans having no desire build and clean mansions. You wouldn't see the same mix match between lifeform/adaptation and it's ecosystem. You wouldn't see foriegn lifeforms because you wouldn't see different ecosystems.

That's because right now, our society is still stuck in the immediate growth part of economics. The grasses, weeds, and ferns that life rushes in, so it'll secure itself against entropy. The stiff competition, and ownership of property rights are exactly what happened in politics and economics. With politics it happened after Clovis (453) I to Charlemagne (800) secured Western Europe after Rome's collapse. To create the grasses, weeds, and ferns, humanity was forced into strict roles of feudal king, priest, knight, gentry, and peasant. Feudalism fostered the beginnings of political life. The nobilities descendants then passed on their political control right via inheritance, despite the fact the political situation was much different by 1500. Europe actually had enough political freedom, enough political "carrying capacity". Humanity had to enter the political ecosystems via revolutions.

After we did, we have enough carrying capacity left over to make economic grasses, weeds, and ferns. We let economics being owned by the first lifeforms to find prosperity. We encouraged their growth via economic property ownership, which was to be passed on via inheritance. And like in nature, and politics, once we had enough carrying capacity, we will start making economic ecosystems.

But for now we are camels trying to live in the Amazon.

## Insurance Money

Let's find out. It's not a simple question. Who was I working for? Picture yourself at the side of the road, car's smashed, you've paid $15,000 in insurance money, and you need it back. So how should this work?

Today after a car carsh, you need to get (insurance) money. That means calling a 1-800 number during business hours, waiting on hold, and eventually talking to an adjuster. The adjuster gets the accident details, check's your account, and eventually send's a check. The entire process takes a few weeks.

Adjusters process dozens of phone calls, emails, voicemails, and faxes a day. It was hilarious learning how to fax something. Did you know the fax machine (1865) was invented before the telephone (1876), and we’re using both to process claims for people who just had a real-life NASCAR experience-gone-wrong in the 21st century.

This doesn't tell us who owns insurance money. But it does tell us who doesn't want to give it back too quickly. Among the approximately 10,000 calls I answered over the years, one call stands out the most. A car crash, and the young driver died on impact. Slide on ice. No one to blame, just a lifetime of unanswerable questions for the father. The father was geniunely lost. So was I. Unlike 911 calls, the people aren’t frantic when talking to an adjuster. They’ve had time to consider everything. They need guidance. Adjusters quickly learn to throw away the mandatory talking points and just talk like a real person. Often adjusters were just shoulders.

I talked to this gentlemen about life, families, my future, his, God and…

DING!… DING!… DING!… DING!… DING!… The supervisor was ringing his bell, what he used to tell us “get back to work, answer more phone calls!”. In the age of super computers and high speed interent in everyone’s hands, this asshole is ringing a bell, so I’ll… Send faxes faster?

So the question of asking who owns insurance money, led me to ask, who do I work for? The person who needs their insurance money to repair their life, or the company tasked with protecting it? Is this bell, fax machines, and 1-800 number the best this gentleman’s annual $2,000 insurance payment gets him. Why is modern technology like WhatsApp and Skype nearly free, while thousands of dollars gets faxes and telephones.

## Prologue intro

Writers call your first impression of a story, “the hook”. Hooked means exactly what it sounds like. Being controlled, in this case by a good story, but in reality, you can be hooked by anything in your life. Like being in love with Juliette, or working to cure cancer. Most people are hooked on paying their bills, and thus are hooked on having a job.

I'm one of them. I've been a movie usher, a projectionist, a officer clerk, a drywaller, a claims adjuster. And I'm probably going to have a bunch more before my story ends. Now I want to scream about these jobs. Even though I enjoyed most of them, I can't help but remember their stupidities. Like how movie ushers spend 90% of their time picking up garbage, but can't ask customers to stop dropping it. Or how claims adjusters talk about car accidents days or weeks after they've happened, with people who had a smartphone at the accident! I want to talk about how much of my story I've wasted on these stupidities.

But I know all workers have the same problem. Work is often stupid. We laugh at it when watching shows like _The Office_, because having a job is confusing, because who do you work for? The person who needs help to watch a movie, or process a claim, or the company paying you? The customer and the company are not the same person. And the worker is stuck in between trying to make both happy.

The truth is every worker isn't working for either. They're a specialist in a technology, be it a projector, or a drywall knife. Every movie theatres has customers, watching a movie from a projector. Every insurance company has drivers, processing claims at a call-centre. Technology is the greatest hook of all. And we're all controlled by our chosen technologies success and failure.

I'll show you. Did you know Wikipedia had a sister called Nupedia. With Nupedia only “expert” professors could make articles, while Wikipedia let anyone contribute, but tracked every change to help erase any errors or vandalism.

Conventional thinking said people would go to the experts. They after all had a history of being in control of society's books of knowledge. Well the first problem was the experts didn't like to share. In their first year, Wikipedia had 40,000 articles. Nupedia had 12. The second problem was it turned out "expert" answers, and answers, are actually the same, Mount Everest is 8,848 metres high nobody who says it. And Wikipedia was far better at finding and sharing answers. Now Nupedia is long dead, Wikipedia has millions of articles, and books of knowledge have turned into Wikipedia searches.

This isn't a simple lesson. I was at an “elite university” when Wikipedia was spreading, learning about the philosophy of technological innovations. The best education I got was seeing the experts antagonize their own futures. Few professors could undertand regular people were experts of something, and were happy to contribute, share, and trust their knowledge. With the right technology, the people could educate themselves.

Yet even professors were threatened. Even though Wikipedia was just a better encylopedia, it doesn't do advanced research, they still couldn't admit Wikipedia's technology is better. Heck, hundreds of thousands of students write term papers every year, that are graded and thrown away. Some could just as easily write or improve Wikipedia articles.

But no. Instead Wikipedia is still mocked, even through it's simple better than books. It was like watching Blockbuster laugh at Netflix because the DVD was the future of movies (which Blockbuster did), or Xerox give Apple the designs for the personal computer because the photocopier was the future of office work (which Xerox did). Now 15 years after Wikipedia started, it's joined by even more technologies, like YouTube, Khan Academy, Udemy, all of which are slowly replacing lecture halls, libraries, and even universities.

So we are all slave to the technology we use. What does this story look like? Because workers still need to pay their rent. So they resist modern technology, while needing it to improve their lives. Otherwise we'd still be buying enclopida's that get old within a few years, renting DVD's, or calling an insurance company to make a claim. The Blockbuster's of the world, universities, printing companies, claim departments, refuses to update to new technology. Their ignorance inspires revolutions.

## Prologue - Notice How Much Darth Blockbuster Likes to Party

Why wouldn't professors, who exist and are paid to research, like to share knowledge. Why wouldn't AT&T want more communication running over its network. Why wouldn't Xerox want personal computers. Why wouldn't Yahoo want to search the internet. Why wouldn't Blockbuster like to help people watch movies faster.

Because these institutions, once on the cutting edge of technology, slowly became filled with Darth Blockbusters. Darth Blockbuster is not a worker on the front-line trying to do a better job. He's a self-entitled piece of shit.

At least that what it seems like. In reality, he likes to party, because he can't foresee a new society, One based on the new technology. Thus Darth Blockbuster defines success by their climb up established institutions hierarchies, as being esteemed princes and executives. They antagonize the grandstory of civilzation's invention of new technology to maintain their status. They use prestige of past heroes to hide their self-entitlement. Supposed divinity, exclusivie parties, stuck-up language, and fake titles are his defense.

Protagonists doubledown. People like Galileo who foresaw a world of science, Alan Kay who foresaw a world of personal computers, and Paul Baran who foresaw a decentralized internet of computers, keep fighting for a better civilization despite so many antagonists.

Thus, my parents aren't protagonists because they fight on top of skycrapers. They're simple curious, smart, hard working, and most important selfless. They showed me middle class extras become protagonists when they embrace new technology. While so many professors, managers, and executives at my jobs would insist university, DVD's, and call centres were the future, despite all the evidence otherwise, my parents, like so many middle class people, would just shut up and learn new technology.

New technology brings new capabilties and thus questions who should hold the power over it. Workers always have a job to do, and thus care about being a better builder, cleaner, or adjuster. While "managers" and "executives" sub-consciously know, nobody has ever had a problem and said "does anyone know any good executives?".

Every organization needs management. But excessive management is a sign of bad technology inside a company, country, or civilization. It means the jig-saw puzzle making of technological creation has stopped to keep the antagoinsts party at full throttle. Thus, new technology constantly empowers individuals to become protagonists and do away with Darth Blockbuster.

Wikipedia is an obvious example. It costs basically nothing compared to our college system. Yet with no official support from anyone in power, and very little management, it's built a knowledge-base that's amazing. And this "Wikinomics" is transforming our civlization by empowering extras, who need far less managerial oversight, because protagonists regulate themselves when freed to live their own mission.

GitHub is like a Wikipedia for computer programs. It lets anyone download and update software. Before GitHub programmers were mostly wage labourer extras. Now their supercharged protagonists who program Wikipedia, Linux, Firefox, and other extremely powerful software, that's free for anyone to use. Before Netflix came along, it was internet "thieves" that introduced online streaming to the world. Community made content on Khan Academy, YouTube, and Udemy, educate for virtually free.

These examples are a few pieces of the jig-saw puzzle the future needs us to build. New technology upturning old industries is a recurring story throughout human history. It happened with politics. The key to victory was always to empower the extras to become protagonists on the side of new technology. To do that requires a new idea to attract the extras. The new idea is for extras to see their leaders as antagoinsts, holding everyone back from moving forward in the grandstory.

New ideas are the job of philosophers. People who go back to basics, and make a new storyline with a new philosophy. If their words are magic enough, they make the extras realize they should stop watching the story, and instead become a protagoinsts by picking up a weapon, and start fighting. One of the best examples was the American and French Revolutions which empowered individuals to wiki their politics, and they were inspired by the magical writing of Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

## Prologue Douglass

Think of Douglass' story. When it happened in 1841, hero and villian switched depending on geography. In the agrarian American South, Sophia would have been a comedic extra for trying to teach a slave to read. Hugh would be a hero for defending slavery. The northern abolitionists would be Darth Vader trying to destabilize the entire economy. And everyone would scream as Douglass got on the ship "he's getting away!".

At the same time, in the industrialized North, people disliked slavery. But not out of morality. Their dislike was because slavery was competition for their own paid work and the machines they loved to build. Hugh was thus maybe a jerk, but not a villian, Sophia should have learned the Southern way, and Douglass should stay away from Northern jobs. In fact trying to keep slavery out, or in, of new American states like Kansas was what sparked the American Civil War (1861-1865).

However, at the same time, the British hated slavery. Hugh was a villian, Sophia was a coward, and Douglass was a glorious protagonist. Douglass actually helped make sure Britain didn't recognize the American South as a country, depriving a powerfulally to the slavers. Also, it it was Irishmen who gave Douglass the money to buy his freedom. Thus, if you lived in the American South, North, and British Empire, all places with similar cultures, you'd see Douglass story three different ways.

And this is how we Today our microstories still have this uncertainty. We simply don't have the perspective to all agree on the same protagonists and antagoinsts. Think of all the things we've fought over since Douglass. Segregation, affirmative action, diveristy training, gay marriage, gun rights, global warming, health insurance, union rights, abortion, migrants, foriegn factories, refugees, capitalism, communism, fascism, environmental regulations, conservatives versus progressives, neo-conservatives vs conservatives, progressives versus socialists, and so many more issues. We keep battling each other, everyone fueled by visions of being Luke Skywalker striking down Darth Vader.

- With institutions by asking why wouldn't professors like to share knowledge. Why wouldn't AT&T want more communication running over its network. Why wouldn't Xerox want personal computers. Why wouldn't Blockbuster want people watching more movies.

It's often called the innovator's dilemma. The more successful a tool gets, the larger the institution needed to support it. It's like buying a bigger house and watching the expenses pile up. But with companies expenses are product lines, buildings, employee contracts, management levels, and other "weight". Many people inside will scream how weight makes solving the tools original problem of "telecommunications", "knowledge", and "storytelling" lost in red tape. Large institutions have bills to pay and using increasingly old technology to pay them is an inconvenient truth. Foresight is a luxry. New technology is a threat.

Some people are natural Darth Blockbuster's. They selfishly want success but are too stupid or risk averse to invent new tools to earn it. Yet, large institutions breed many more antagonists because of the innovator's dilemma. Think of all those Blockuster regional store managers, or better yet, all those PhD students of Film Studies, and Geography. Can these experts upload their knowledge on Wikipedia. Maybe, but they definitely want their money back. And that means promoting a prestigous university to the next generation. Old tools become a hot potato nobody wants to be left holding.

This is actually good news. Conquering large institutons is easier than conquering human selfishness. We just need to keep inventing new technology, like Wikipedia, to undercut bygone institutions. While this may suck for those invested in the past, it helps anyone who plans on living in the future.

## Frederick Douglass

he story gets even better. Frederick quickly found friends in the north free states. A radical Christian minority called abolitionists who took the Declaration of Independence literally when it said "all men are created equal".

It wasn't long before Frederick was at a hall of these freedom lovers. People, like his once upon a time angel Sophia, who treated him as a man. These people ignored the clicking of society's rules and wanted to hear him speak. In a time with no pictures, no movies, no telephones, Douglass was the source of knowledge they couldn't get. What was slavery really like? Are blacks really dangerous? Are slaveowners cruel? What is the truth?

Frederick rose and spoke. His oratory matched his bravery. He spoke again, and again and again. Douglass told everyone what Hugh said to Sophia to make her follow the rules; "if a slave learned to read, he would learn about the world, and the slave would become unhappy with his condition and desire freedom." Douglass said this was the first anti-slavery speech he had ever heard. Sophia thought she could be a good citizen to Maryland, a good wife to Hugh, and a good person to Douglass, by keeping him ignorant.

Frederick Douglass took the lesson well. He spread his brilliant oratory beyond the sound of his voice, in the best way. With words. He wrote many books, and he wrote them so well, it clicked millions of people into a new set of rules. Slavery is evil, _all_ people are equal. You can read it now in many books. It would make Douglass happy you educated yourself, and understood why these are the good rules.

Another is how poor the rebel armies were. A reflection of the society, they were always hungry, short of supplies, and even shoeless. The war's decisive battle at Gettysburg (1863) was fought because the town had a shoe factory the south wanted to raid.

If you see war as a battle of tools, the south had slavery, the north had machines. One needs ignorance and oppression, the other education and innovation. Frederick

## Personal blah

The key to empowering the extras is giving them the tools. It wont be easy. I studied the question for a while while working a host of front-line job. I made a new tool that saved about 100 million in operating costs for an industry. I didn't want any fame or fortune, I just wanted to empower co-workers to have better workdays, and some time to write a boring philospophy book.

Getting it approved by the power-brokers was like talking to Darth Vader. They never even asked the extras on the frontline. Instead always found a reason why the new tool was wrong, and the old tool was right. I was supposed to sing and dance for them. Instead I wrote my philosophy book like a rallying call for the extras. And made a new app that will save tens of billion in operating costs and return it to the middle class, so we can all sing and dance to our own music.

For example, the movie theater is a nearly dead storytelling tool in our society. That's not an opinion, I worked inside empty auditoriums for years. However, mass media and studios ignore this, among other ways, by bragging about high "box-office grosses". A movie's gross includes currency inflation, ticket price and population increases. It's meaningless to gauge popularity year over year. Ticket sales are far better, but those are kept secret.

Frontline insights like show how contemporary philosophies don't matter. Although actors are often proud progressives, and corporate businessman often staunch capitalists, they work together to keep a dying tool alive. The difference between good and bad guys is simple proximity. When you count empty theatre seats because you feel the pain of less shifts, while at the same time, you feel the pain of full theaters overflowing with garbage, you wish for a better way, and thus want a better tool. The further you are from the frontline, the more you filter out the truth with things like movie grosses, gender equality, or some other philosophical.

## Movie Theatres Vertival Integration

The movie industry should be solving this problem. It tried throwing money at it with 3D movies, but 3D tell bad stories. The short answer is theatres and studios are separate industries who hate each other. They should unify like Apple Stores, and start working together to give people an affordable night of entertainment. But they can't without questioning who should be in control. So the higher ups in both dying industries hide inside movie grosses.

The lesson is, only the people who count empty theatre seats because they feel the pain of less shifts have a good reason to make changes and invent new tools. In this case live entertainment, cheaper prices, story quality control, double features, affordable food all work well. The further you are from the frontline, the more you filter out real problems.

And here you can see the cast of characters. People on the frontline with the incentive to make new tools, with people in positions of power around the old tool, who don't. This happens on most every new tool. Frontline workers like game developers, taxi drivers, or hosts love Steam, Uber, and AirBnB, while the higher up you go in retail game stores, taxi companies, and hotel corporations, always find reasons to stop it.

## Fight with the recap of chapter, too long

Let's reflect a little bit on our civilization's story. Humanity has a stream of problems like cold, hunger, and disease. We solve them with tools. To solve them better, we need new tools.

Protagonists respond. Of course they do, they're heroes. They use new technology to invent new tools to ease the pain on the frontline. Their continued self-sacrifice slowly empowers people so we all solve our problems with better knowledge, efficiency, and dependability.

Then we have antagonists. Tools develop a power structure, and we reward people for rising in it. Thus, when protagonist's new tools undercut the power structure, antagonists selfishly respond to defend their wealth, power, and prestige.

Antagonists often manage companies or institutions based on dated tools. They look down, but unknowingly fear, working on the frontline because feeling its pain invalidates their old tools.

Lastly we have the extras, everybody in the middle of a battle between two tools. Because they have no direct interest they can pick winners and losers. Usually extras are in the middle class; not so poor as to be desperate, but not so powerful they want to keep the world the same. Sadly, extras don't realize their power.

This is a archetypal human story. Galileo fought a religious establisment with a telescope, George Washington fought a political establishment with a musket, and Steve Jobs fought a economic establishment with an iPod. Nikola Tesla, Marc Andressen, Elon Musk are other heroic examples. Each protagonist was lucky enough to win over the extras.

And that's why you need to stop watching and start fighting. It is important to remember the story is about supporting new tools, not fighting a group of people. Dated philosophies are the bullies against "bankers" and "lawyers", "rich" and "poor". We fight problems, and thus fight _for_ tools, not against groups of people who may or may not be antagonists.

After all, our lives cut across many poblems and tools. We can be a protagonist for a new tool, an extra for many, and even an antagonist for a few. For example, while professors were antagonists to a better encyclopedia, many of Wikipedia's facts were discovered by professors, so they're hardly pure villians. Fight for better tax laws, road traffic, health care, the same way we fought for a better enclyclopedia, by supporting better tools.

To empower the extras in real time, they'll need to see antagonists in real-time. AT&T, Xerox, Blockbuster, would all like a trip into a time machine instead of being cautionary tales. Without one we have to wait for historical perspective to tell us who the antagonists are.

Until now. We need to empower extras to either support the good guys either as extras or protagonists. So in _Techvolution_, we'll have to learn how to tell the difference between good and bad tools. Thus, we'll spot antagonists in real-time. Real villians in need of a proper fight. Ones I call Darth Blockbuster.

## Professors no like Wikipedia for coursework

Typical of the story, Wikipedia was a small and unskilled hero, mocked by the established experts who refused to support "publish now" being open to the masses. I was at university when Wikipedia was taking off. It was amazing seeing self-described experts antagonize their own futures. I saw it most when asking why students couldn't be assigned Wikipedia articles to write or update.

They laughed at the idea. I wondered why. Academia is paid tons of money to find and document knowledge. They love to compete to publish obsure bits like "Is Film Noir a Movie Genre" to publications only their friends read. So why did the professors need to delegate millions of assigments, labs, and term papers, read them once, and throw the knowledge away; only to re-delegate the same work the next semester.

Wikipedia's mission statement is "Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge". In retrospect, but only after paying my tuition, I think I figured out why universities did not want to join Wikipedia's community. Another lesson from the frontline.

## Definitions

Protagonists: they selflessly invent, spread, and use new technology to make new tools. Usually close to the frontline, they individually struggle, but their continued self-sacrifice slowly improves life on Earth.

Antagonists: selfishly resist new tools to defend their wealth, power, and prestige. Antagonists often manage companies or institutions based on dated technologies and think working on the frontline is beneath them.

Extras: everybody in the middle of a battle between two tools. Because they have no direct interest in either side, they can pick winners and losers. Usually extras are in the middle class; not so poor as to be desperate, but not so powerful they want to keep the world the same. Sadly, extras don't realize their power.

## movie theatres

For example lets use movie theatres. They're a dying storytelling tool in our society. That's not an opinion, I worked inside empty auditoriums for years. However, mass media, theatres, and studios total ignore this, among other ways, by bragging about high "box-office grosses". A movie's gross includes currency inflation, ticket price jumps, and population increases. It's meaningless to gauge popularity year over year. Tickets sold are far better, but those are kept secret.

Frontline workers can't hide behind economic stats. Empty seats automatically mean less shifts. Changing the tool, movie theatres, makes sense to a frontline work. As does faster checkout lines, cleaner theatres, and better movies. However, entertainment reporters, movie marketers, industry spokesman, government regulators, can hide behind "rising movie grosses", thus defend their control over the tool, and thus antagonise change. Why rock the boat if you feel no pain?

## tribal politics

They did during industrialization when tools were mass produced because everyone worked in a highly interdependant economy geared towards mass production of tools. Businesses, bankers, workers, regulators,shared the same interests, and thus needed tribal politics.

Yet, tool making in the digital age is so easy and powerful, we don't need to huddle into massive groups of red vs blue, rich vs poor, owner vs worker. Everyone can be the hero of their own story because we can make custom tools for each individual problem. We can understand your travel requirements so you avoid traffic. Know what exact food will optimize your health. Specifically educate you on what you need to know. Customizable tools is a fundametntally different political and economic story.

## johnny's story

I was raised by parents who fled the communists of Eastern Europe. Their loveable mentality was people should work only when there's free time. Kidding aside (not really), they showed me how important tools are. Building a house, installing an air conditioner, cleaning a job-site, is simply using, many tools. The more the better.

I tried to keep this work ethic alive in my jobs. I was a newspaper boy, a movie theater usher, a projectionist, a bunch of factories and warehouses, an office clerk, an account manager, a claims adjuster. I was happily one of those co-workers you sometimes forget about because they just do their job.

That's why I'm (grudingly) grateful a nagging stutter made me too shy to leave the frontline. In retrospect, it's a great place to see where protagonists and antagonists come from. Frontline workers need tools because they do - either the house is there, or its not. Thus, they're natural protagonists

## How I Got Here

I'm nobody special. I was raised by parents who fled the communists of Eastern Europe. Their loveable mentality was people should work only when there's free time. Kidding aside (not really), I worked construction, cleaning, been a movie theater usher, a projectionist, a bunch of factories and warehouses, an account manager, a claims adjuster. A nagging stutter made me too shy to leave the frontline. I was happily one of those co-workers you sometimes forget about because they just do their job.

For a while I was a face painted ideologue but stopped when I realized I was still taking the bus regardless who won. I formally and informally studied the history and philosophy of technology for years. When I thought I knew my stuff, I made a new tool for an old industry. My little app was cheap, effective, and saved tens of millions of dollars. I was rightfully proud of it, and wanted to share my wisdom. But I didn't know shit. I was an extra up against gatekeepers.

I won't go into details. There's no need. If you've used Napster, Netflix, Lyft, Skype, Kickstarter, GitHub, AirBnB, or Firefox, you already know how empowering our new digital tools are. Many protagonists have worked hard to create the new tools of a wonderful new reality, but antagonists keep stomping on it. I'm happy I got bruised up. It taught me a new philosophy.

Now I feel like Galileo looking through his telescope and seeing the Earth revolve around the Sun. I took my small political wisdom, mixed in limited tech experience, added the bruises, and out of the oven came Techvoluion.

Stories sometimes need new languages for their new worlds. Ours needs a new philosophy. I made one for you. It was hard, but still way easier than dealing with those damn antagonists.

## IDK

Until we master making new tools, each new one will be made by a small group of protagonists obsessed with solving a problem in a better way. Many stronger, richer, and prestigious antagonists will suppress it build up prop up its existing tools. For example, Blockbuster used email, teleconferencing, and had a website, but wanted people to drive back and forth to its stores instead of pressing "watch now".

We will master our the creation of new tools when the extras realize their power. Because unlike an audience, extras are in the story, and thus if you realize your power, you can pick winners just be choosing the tool you want to use. Happily the extras fought for Wikipedia, online streaming, Telsa, and the rest already mentioned.

But there are millions of tools today not so lucky. So many of our problems, like rampant unpaid overtime, not sleeping enough, incomprehensible tax codes, expensive formal education, endless road traffic, glass ceilings, exist because the tools that'll solve them are repressed. The extras who care think "fiscal conservatism" or "democractic socialism" will help, the ones who don't binge Netflix. In truth all the extras have the same power to turn make lightsabers. Just by joining the battle over new tools.

## We Need A New Philosophy

Right now regular people are either obsessed with red vs blue politics, watching professional sports, another Marvel movie, or binging on Netflix.

It's no ones fault. Really it isn't. No one is to blame. We're extras because our society uses old philosophies. Until someone invents a new one, we're stuck with ones like conservatism (1781), progressivism (1868), marxism (1856), and free-market economics (1776).

We're using philosophies founded to help the world industrialize. Before rubber shoes, indoor plumbing, and electricity; when humanity could only mass produce a few tools like wood barrels, steam engines, and pencils. Businesses, bankers, workers, regulators, rightly needed highly interdependent philosophies.

Yet, tool making in the digital age is so easy and powerful, everyone can be the hero of their own story. We can understand your travel requirements so you avoid traffic. Know what exact food will optimize your health. Specifically educate you on what you need to know. 3D print your new hammer. Customizable tools is a fundametntally different political and economic story.

Using philosophies born when the moon was our nightlight is holding everyone in our society back. Even main characters in politics and business are suffering. Especially them actually. After all they have to try and motivate voters and employees to care using philosophies that can't.

Just look at the the recent shake ups. The Tea Party, Move On, Brexit, Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, Proud Boys, Antifa, Yellow Jackets. These aren't an accident. They're the result of our old philosophies not solving everday problems like road traffic, climate change, and shaky employment. Leaders think we're breaking the rules. But we're looking for new philosophy to improve our lives.

While I hope our leaders and political junkies likes it, if you're sick red vs blue politics, sick of being an extra, I wrote this book for you. Keep in mind, a new philosophy is a big deal. It's like writing a story for all society to act in. We'll go step by step.

## Personal Note

If you liked _Skin in the Game_, _Rework_, _Zero to One_, _The Great Degeneration_, and _The Innovators_, you'll probably like this book. These books are amazing and helped me make this one. And by the way, I never forgot about my little app. It got bigger and it'll be the lightsaber for the middle class. But more about that later.

And to Darth Blockbuster. You're not evil. But you can't work at Blockbuster and get to use Netflix. Because if everyone thinks like that, our entire civilization stays filled with Blockbusters, and that's fucking horrible. Nobody wins.

Moreoever, will all benefit inside a society that works for, not against, new digital tools. Politicians will govern more and fundraise less. Executives will lead us to the future and stop grinding out quarterly earnings. Marketers will brainstorm about cool new tools more instead of doing the ten millionith car commercial. Activists will empower the poweless with tools instead of marching and yelling.

Our wondrous digital technology will give us this bright future if we embrace it. Saying that, if you still want to scream at political rallies about Marxist ideology, or sit in a corner office and delegate work like Charles Montgomery Burns, that's on you. The digital age is one of individual empowerment with new tools. Help update our society, or be everyone's villian.

## misc from prologue

Teach or study at an expensive university lecture hall and you'll fight to keep it alive by saying government should pay; and thus be a old school socialist. Work in at Blockbuster with vanquishing DVD sales, you'll lobby both political parties to attack online streaming, increase tax-credits, and lower minimum wages. Make candy apples, and you'll tell everyone to eat candy apples.

## Preface

I'm nobody special. I've been a political ideologue, a movie theater usher, a projectionist, a bunch of factories and warehouses, an account manager, a claims adjuster. I had nagging stutter, which made me too shy to leave the frontline. I was happily one of those co-workers you sometimes forget about because they just do their job.

I formally and informally studied the history and philosophy of technology for years. When I thought I knew my stuff, I made a new tool for an old industry. My little app was cheap, effective, and saved tens of millions of dollars. I was proud of it, and wanted to share my wisdom. But I didn't know shit. All I did was run into gatekeepers.

I won't go into details. Instead I wrote this book. It was hard, but still way easier than dealing with those damn antagonists.

## New Prologue

Here's why. Politics is a story, and an election is the climax. And if we can't tell the difference, there's something wrong.

We care so much in _Romeo and Juliet_ and _Star Wars_, because either young love is embraced, or it dies. Either the rebellion is saved, or the rebels all die. These stories will live forever, because everyone appreciates what's at stake. There's nothing at stake in blue vs red, because they're not differenct enough.

## Frontline

Our world's in a bad state. And it wont get better until we fight back. The view from the frontline is the same. That's why I'm (grudingly) grateful a nagging stutter made me too shy to leave the frontline. In retrospect, it's a great place to see pain from so many different places.

The people are disadvantaged. We deal with problems, from small pots on our roads, to waiting on hold with our health insurance. Workers expect to get outsourced by bosses so busy looking up to the prince, they don't even know what the job at the bottom is.

So, although we work for companies, we are actually tool users. I mean, say you're a newspaper printer at the New York Times. You could go to the New York Post and do the same job. So although newspapers compete with each other, they're tied to the same technology.

You can see this divide yourself. Tell your co-workers and company you're leaving for a new industry. They'll give you well wishes and a good bye cake. Tell them you're going to a competitor. They'll make fun of you, and probably give you a good bye cake. Now tell them you invented digital newspapers. You've questioned their livelihoods, and they'll be scared.

But not everyone. Some people will be curious, some happy, and some will even fight back. And this battle over technologies is where the protagoinsts, antagonists, and extras of the playout the grandstory of humanity.

Good thing some protagonsits already have. Let's go to the war room and see the battle scared and the path to victory.

## Majic

While Darth Blockbuster can claim to be a innovator, he can't claim to be a majician.

## Listerine

You ever use Listerine? It's a good idea too. It kills 99.9% of bacteria. Actually I'm not a dentist or doctor, so maybe it's a good idea, I can't say for sure. It's definitely a good idea to santize your wounds by killing all the bacteria.

There's a link. The mouthwash is named after Joseph Lister. He was born a Quaker in 1827 England, trained to be a surgeon, and entered the Royal College of Surgeons in 1853. On his honeymoon, the new doctor visted medical research facilties, and fell in love with medical research, as did is wife Agnes, who was his life long lab partner.

From the beginning of time, to mid-1800's, doctors didn't wash their hands. Even when removing a limb, doctors would show up with blood stained gowns, surgical tools, and go to work in a small stadium. Surguries were so spectular people off the street would watch. No sanitation anywhere.

Nobody knew about microbiology. The general assumption was infections were caused by "bad air", so hospitals would be aired out, but never disinfected. The horror.

Lister read about Louis Pasteur's experiments with fermenting milk. Pasteur discovered the start of microbiology, and how to prevent food spoilage as a result (that's why we call milk "pasteurized").

Lister, and several others, connected the dots, and found a chemical solution to kill bacteria on human wounds. He experimented by cleaning surgical instruments and wounds and no surprise to us, his patients didn't get infections nearly as much. After some more research surgery became antiseptic. Today we don't watch it off the street, but behind television screens.

Except it took years to get the surgeons on board. Lister was mocked. The idea of "microorganisms" was incredible. Few people bought it and continued to air out hospitals instead. Even when President Garfield was shot, his surgeons worked on him for months

## Nobles divinity stories

All because society couldn't proactively change their ruling philosophy. The nobles divine right to rule was set to go on forever. When the anarchy of Rome's collapse was solved with a return to civilization, the "noble" rulers were divine without reason.

Like any story, our ruling philosophy should have a goal. With goals come a natural conclusion. Protagonists are heroes because they set to overcome's the stories problem, and achieve it's goal. It's only while the hero fights the villians, is she rightfully considered divine.

However, in stories when the problem is overcome, the hero returns to being a regular person, and loses his divinity. Unfortunately, people took the nobles divine right to rule literally. It wasn't a story of overcoming a problem, who thereafter had a No story.there wasn't a clause in the nobles divine right to rule to explain why these protagoinsts were divine (returning law and order), and thus there was no conclusion to the nobles divinity. Stuck inside their ruling philosophy, the nobles were protagonsits in their eyes, while being "Darth Kings" to history.

Similarly, on ruling philosophy as no conclusion built in. Ask any Darth Blockbuster you want, managing partnet at a consultanting firm, high priced lawyer, music executive, Professor of Distinguished Chair of Media Studies, when the problem that makes them an protagoinsts is overcome,so they can return to being a regular person. They won't even know what the fuck you're talking about. They're divine.

Thus, Skywalker we're doomed to the same fate. That's why we have to master the human story, to help the extras participate in Techvolution, and pick the real protagonists in the open source community.

## Sid Meier's Civilization

## APPLICATIONS

Let's see what the full triangle looks like.

![The Matrix](\../img\thewriter\triangle-the-matrix.png)
**The Matrix:** The story is about machines that enslave humanity inside a virtual prison that looks like 1990's America. Humans are connected with a connection into our skulls. The real world is a dystopia and people are power generators for the machines.

The antagonist machine leader likes the matrix, and defends the ruling philosophy of slavery. The protagonist Neo slowly realizes ways to master The Matrix's philosophy and overpowers the ignorant antagonists. The plot is about cutting the cord that lets the machines control human prisoners.

![Star War](\../img\thewriter\triangle-star-wars.png)
**Star Wars:** An entire galaxy is controlled by a evil Empire. Evildoers keep control with their superweapon Death Star. Meagre resistance fighters stole its schematics and might find a weakness. The antagonist is Darth Vader who needs to save the Death Star to keep the Dark Side on top of the eternal philosophy battle between Light and Dark Sides. The protagonist Luke slowly realizes how to master the Light Side and become strong enough to defeat Darth Vader. The plot depends of if Luke's missle will destroy the Death Star.

## Checks and Balances in the entertainment industry

When we hit the Digital Age in the 1970's, iTunes, Netflix, Steam and other digital distribution methods became possible. Still far off, but possible to start having a society that empowers individuals with open access, distributed, democratized technology. Tax forms, insurance claims, wedding invitations, doctor questions and answers, university lectures, textbooks, online voting, and so many other things were possible. The quick victory of Netflix shows how ready the masses are to upgrade to the digital age. The happy ruling nobility are happy antagonising the future instead.

While the people were being "pirates". The entertainment had endless banquets and balls. Movie premieres, talk shows, award shows, and launch parties. The Oscars, Correspondence Dinners, Emmy's, Golden Globes, Cannes Film Festival, Sundance Film Festival, Toronto International Film Festival, and so many others, all modern version of banquets and balls, with gates to keep you out, and rules put in place to make the good times going.

By the way, while the entertainment industry was calling regular people thieves from the party box, they were lobbying the people's government to give them tax credits. Between 2000-2009, California went from having 2/3 of production, to 1/3 because they didn't give in. The entertainment industry went from state to state, country to country, moving to whichever charged the least tax. It's so low now, they basically pay no taxes.

Also, you know the string of company names before a movie. Lile Acme Entertainment, those are tax shelters. Companies studios setup to make this one movie. Acme pays the studio a fee for the licensing rights of the story. Through a huge array of creative accounting, Acme always loses money, avoid taxes, and the studio keeps it fee.

Creative accounting, keeping wages low, and increasing prices on regular people is what defines a succesful movie executive. Old executives, like Harry Cohn, David O. Selznick, and Irving Thalberg were master storytellers. No surprised, since the 1970's, movie executives can't tell good stories. They use special effects, mass marketing, remakes, sequals, celebrities, and gore porn, to hide that fact. I'll let John Wayne explain it.

  > All the real motion picture people have always made family pictures. But the downbeats and the so-called intelligentsia got in when the government stupidly split up the production companies and the theaters. The old giants like Mayer, Thalberg, even Harry Cohn, despite the fact that personally I couldn't stand him—were good for this industry. Now the goddamned stock manipulators have taken over. They don't know a goddamned thing about making movies. They make something dirty, and it makes money, and they say, 'Jesus, let's make one a little dirtier, maybe it'll make more money.' And now even the bankers are getting their noses into it

Online downloading was merely a check and balance against antagonists. Once a company came along made a new tool that distributed the power to the people, the people happily formed a majic bond with it. And if they get abused again, the people know where to go to check the excess.

## Social Capital

Social capital - USA
<iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/trust-attitudes-in-the-us?time=1972..2014" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"></iframe>
Social capital is the trust people have in each other. The more people socialize, the more trust they'll have with each other. It's often called "Bowling Alone".

## Aristarchus Birthdays

For example, every birthday party used to be a celebration the Sun revolved around you. Think of how silly it is the Earth being  stationary, and the stars, galaxies, and Universe revolve around us. But the truth that was, when we could probe the Universe with our eyes.

We thought of the truth. Ancent Greek astronomer and mathematician Aristarchus of Samos (310-230 BC) said the Earth moved. He correctly figured out the relative sizes of the Moon, Sun, and Earth. He did it by testing a well in Egypt that once a year had no shadow. He reasoned the Sun is directly above it. On the same day he measured the shadow of the great Tower of Alexandria. He measured the distances and heights of everything, used the pythgorean theorem, and voila, the Sun is 80 times the size of Earth, and the Moon is one forth. Aristarchus thereafter said why would the Sun move if it's so much bigger.

Aristarchus was right, but his argument still lost because we didn't have the tools yet to see the truth. Aristotle said if the Earth moved so much, why don't the stars move in the sky. Aristarchus said the truth was the stars are extemely far away. But the truth was unbelieveable to people who measured things in feet so Aristotle won. The rule was thus the Sun revolved us on our birthdays.

Geocentrism was a big rule. It was rooted in the Bible, which was the basis of the ruling nobility's power too. When Copernicus used mathematics to question geo-centrism, it wasn't enough. When Galileo used the telescope it helped alot. However, it was only when telescopes got powerful and cheap enough the people could see the truth themselves, that we accepted we revolved around the Earth on our birthdays. Thereafter the rulebook coldn't be corrupted with human interpratations of the truth. Science took over to explain illness, disease, gravity, and the stars. Darth King's days were set the day kids started to get telescopes for their birthdays.

## Life Star

That damn Obi-Wan. He probably turned into a ghost like in the movie and went on vacation or wherever. But no worries. For I am Skywalker, destined to save the galaxy and bring balance to human evolution. So here we go. Let's build the Life Star.

We don't know exactly what it is. Yet we have a great starting point. It's opposite. Light is the opposite of dark the same way full is the opposite of empty. Knowing one, defines the other. The Death Star is a rule book written humans. The Life Star is the opposite of the Death Star.

So what is it? The Life Star is a rule book no human can write. Rules can't be added, fudged, or abused, only uncovered. Happily, we already use this rule book. It's  helped us truly understand our world in so many ways, in areas like chemistry, biology and physics. Of course I'm speaking about Nature.

Nature doesn't change. Gravity, thermodynamics, mitosis, are all rules. But no one can scratch them out and put in there own. Today a person can't say objects on Earth fall at 20 meters squared. The answer is 9.8 m2, and anyone can test it. The powerful are those who master the Truth, not those who write it.

It use to be the opposite. Before the telescope, microscope, and scientific method the powerful could tell everyone what the rules of Nature were. In Renaissance Europe, Friar Bruno (1548-1600) went from country to country telling everyone the human rules were wrong. The Earth revolved the Sun, and worst, there was other solar systems with other planets out there. God's Creation is a limitless Universe. He got burned alive for heresy against human made rules.

We know better today. Not because we're smarter, or wiser, or have better morals and ethics. We know better because we have better cyborgology. Like a ecosystem with more lifeforms, our tools can sense Nature better, and thereby probe it for answers.

We learned Nature with tools. It was microscopes, telescopes, and all the other scientific tools that merged with our natural senses, to probe Nature, and let us uncover its rules in every more detail.

Unlocking Nature's rules slowly undercut Darth Kings divinity. Soon they were the ones facing death for breaking Nature's rules.

Now it is digital tools the empower us to sense and probe Nature. Free of Darth Blockbuster's interference, the extras can spread sensory input with digital tools throughout our society. Since only the people on the frontline will decide good from bad, we'll start to understand what solves traffic, heart attacks, and climate change.

This economic enlightenment will under cut not only Darth Blockbuster's, but also the Sith's ability to corrupt society's man made rule book. Economic policies and political ideologies will cease to be human mande rules. The rules of that bring sustainable human life on Earth will

 Death Stars. Because once we build the Life Star, there's no room left for human made rules. The only rule will be natural selection of our own tools with unhindered Techvolution.

I'll explain the Life Star by asking you a question you can't answer. How old are you?

## Ruling Philosophy Rousseau

Rousseau said the nobility were con artists. They hid behind divinity to rule society for their self interest. Yet noble families ruled every European country. There had to be some reason for it, and there was. At first these families were declared holy by the people, because they were holy.

I'll tell a quick story to explain. It starts with the fall of Western Rome. Rome started as a republic in 753 BC and became a Empire in 27 BC. After several centuries of great prosperity, around 180, the Roman Empire started to suffer a general decline caused by frequent civil wars, declining population, bloated civil administration, greedy military, lazy civilians, stupid emperors, relentless barbarian invasions, and the pacificying effects of Christianty. Finally in 476 western Rome fell apart. The water didn't run. The judges didn't rule. The military didn't defend. It was chaos. Almost like a zombie apocolypse movie.

No kidding. Vikings raided, Arabs invaded, Vandals roamed. This is when the Dark Ages (500 - 1000) started. We call it the Dark Ages, because there is literally almost no record of anything. Few people wrote records, histories, manuscripts, laws; Western Europe went "dark". In times of such anarchy, the people needed security above all else. Whoever stopped the zombies must surely be holy.

The former Roman province of Gaul was at the centre of chaos. Native Celts were pushed out to Wales, Scotland, and Ireland by invading Germanic tribes. These tribes added to the chaos by warring with each other. Eventually however, the Franks won when their leader Clovis I (466-511), established a new kingdom. His dynasty ruled for centuries. Each new generation returned more law and order, and military protection, to the Kingdom of France.

The kingdom was backed by the one remaining Roman institution, the Roman Catholic Church. The churhes priests told the people to cherish their nobility. Sermons told the people the Bible says kings are God's chosen representatives. The people couldn't read the Bible themselves, or even understand the Latin of sermons, but it didn't take much convincing anyway. Raids, invasions, and attacks were less and less. With peace came better farming, trade, and growth. The nobles divine right to rule had the people's support. They could see the defeated invaders, and feel the full stomachs for themselves. Divinity was a logical reality.

The problem with the story of the nobles divine right to rule, wasn't the divinity of the original nobles. France's Kings after Clovis I, like Charles Martel (688-741) and Charlemagne (742-814), all fought on many battlefields to protect their people while making rules to help them prosper. Of course they were protecting their power and taxpayers too. But that's the point. The leaders and the people had a symbiotic relationship.

They worked well together. Soon after Charlemagne, Europe left the Dark Ages and entered the High Middle Ages (1000 - 1300). This time wasn't all the bad to live in, with relative peace, security, and wealth not seen since Rome's peak. We still celebrate it with "Medieval Times" and "Game of Thrones" romanticized stories.

The problem with the nobles's divine story, is the nobles divine right to rule didn't have a conclusion. As Europe kept improving through the High Middle Ages, Late Middle Ages, Renaissance, Enlightenment, it got more peaceful and richer.

But all the wealth was going to the divine nobility. Now long removed from fighting Vikings or Vandals, these nobles told themselves they were divine because of their "noble blood". The nobility that Rousseau knew didn't live in castles wearing dirty body armour of war heroes. They lived in opulant palaces and enjoyed endless banquets and balls. Cinderella wasn't even allowed in!

Here's a few paintings to showcase the change. One's of Charles Martel, and his people. The other of Louis XVI (1754-1793), and his people. You can see the difference in their clothing, and homes.

![Martel to Louis](/img\diagrams/techvolution-martel-louis.png)

Opulance and wealth. They're like signs of a ruling philosophy gone on too long. Early nobles wrote rules to encourage new tools forming majically connections with regular people and improving society for everyone. In the Middle Ages, peasant farmers were supposed to make tills to harvest more food, use screws to dig good wells, work iron to make lots of barrels.

However, as new tools kept getting more powerful, the nobles wrote rules to keep them away from the extras. Books, muskets, scientific instruments were all very empowering. They were kept away from the people by dark majic like fancier cathedrals and royal palaces. Tricks to prevent the people from connecting with new tools, to upgrade their cyborgology.

Here's an example of the divide. Louis XIV made a program to let French peasants visit the Palace at Versailles. Tours were free, and only required a hat and coat (spares were available for rent). Louis wanted "his people" to see how glorious his kingdom was. He thought once the people saw entire rooms made of gold, and hallways of mirrors, they'd see how lucky they were to live in his kingdom.

Ironcially, most peasants didn't have a mirror, and rarely saw their own face. When they saw the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles they saw all the needed in the splendid art and spectacle. The fact the royalty didn't pay taxes, and they did, meant something was wrong with the rules.

The large divide between ruling philosophy, and frontline problems, marked the impending end of the nobles divine right to rule. It was a change seen in the change of early nobles castles and armour, used to defend their people, into palaces and dresses, used to enjoy a fun time at society's expense. Banquets and balls marked the impending end of Darth King. We need to understand exactly why to help forecast our problems. And our answer is in mastering stories.

## Office Space

![Argh](\../img\stories\triangle-office-space.png)
**Office Space:**  Hits close to home, the story about the boring drugery of modern suburban life and office work. The ruling philosophy is commercialism that gives workers repetitive tasks and keeps them in line with absurd office culture and just enough money to pay their bills. The antagonist is the boss who gets a disproportionate amount of money, prestige, and power.

The protagonist is the guy who values his freedom more then money. The plot rests on whether the protagonist will control the tool, money, to free himself from having to work anymore.

## Charting Stories

What does a healthy story, its events, philosophies, characters, and items, work together.

Here's a legend.

![Legend](\../img\breakdowns\story-legend.png)

**Old Society** - The society before the story starts.
**Beginning** - When the protagonist breaks from society.
**Protagonist philosophy** - The good guy acts out his philosophy.
**Antagonist philosophy** -  The bad guy acts out his philosophy.
**Realizations** -  Moments when a character realizes something.
**Suffering of the Protagonist** - Long periods when the protagonists suffers.
**Reversal of Situations** - When the plot changes big time.
**Free will** - The time character's have to act. Small spread is grave danger, big is nothing matters.
**Conclusion** - The final battle.
**New Society** - The result of the battle.

This is the how story's look like. We'll map out the fight over new tools soon. First we have to see the three difference kinds of stories we'll encounter.

## Majic vs Dark Majic

Good movies are often called movie magic. Among the other reasons, I used the name majic for this reason. We know a person needs a story to continually surprise with reasonable revelations to connect with it. It turns out the same thing applies for anyone to majically bond with a tool. Understanding one, helps understand the other.

When someone bonds with a new tool, it's not because they know what's going to happen next, but because they reasonable believe they'll find surprising new uses and benefits.

Bad stories, and old tools are similarly related. Without memorable twists, turns, and good lines, bad movies have to take advantage of old memories, fancy effects, or mass marketing to attract attention. And this is degenerative like an addiction. That's why blockbuster movies keeping piling on the effects.

Likewise, old tools use these same techniques to distract from their dysfunction. Thus, we like good stories because they make sense, and lead us to new emotions, ideas, and memories, and we have to be tricked into liking bad ones because they exploit our old memories.

Thus, later kings were like a boring party guest. They told stories about their divinity and used dark majic techniques to distract from the fact that the people increasingly heard as bad stories. And that's the difference between the kings we loved, to the ones we hated. We'll see it better when we peel away the layers of stories.

## storytelling and majic

Trapped inside divinity, the nobles missed the opportunity to be the protagonists of the next great story in humanity. Starting in the Renaissance amazing new tools like mass printed books, guns, and scientific instruments, were ready and waiting to upgrade the people's cyborology. Society had millions of people like Frederick Douglas, waiting to learn the learn the majic of new tools. The nobles could have been the heroes of our history, and proactively changed society.

Instead, they used the ruling philosophy to make rules to block majic, and became our history's villians. Gun ownership was not allowed. Books had to be approved. Science was suspect. Left out of the naturally good story, the pompeous nobles tried to entertain their audience of extras with bad stories.

While the original nobles lived a functional story, the perfumed ones didn't. Starting in the renassaince they made spectacle for the masses with brilliant cathedrals and stuff, while increasingly living artful lives unbound from having to solve any problems. The majic of new tools was thus hidden from the people.

You can see this change from good to bad movies inside Star Wars. The original was a budget film. But it didn't matter. It was a good story that rung true with society who made it "divine" in their culture. Lines like "May the Force be with you", Jedi mind tricks, star destroyers, the opening text crawl, lightsabre duals, everything was believed in because Star Wars was a good story.

Fast forward to today and Star Wars movies aren't good. Like most blockbusters, they're effects filled, mass marketed, stories that don't make people scream, yell, cry, or rave anymore.

For simple proof, what's your favorite line or moment from a recent Star Wars movie? Even if you didn't see it 40 years ago, you'd still have an answer because fans didn't shut up about it.

Yet movies officially remain celebrated inside festivals, premieres, and award shows, all versions of "banquets and balls". Movies today take the people for granted. They stay alive using childhood memories.

As the luster wears off for Star Wars, it reveals how the people lost their attachment to the nobles. They simply found emotions and memories with new heroes. Leaders like George Washington and Rousseau who said, "Follow me and we'll improve your life with better tools."

And this same change also happened in movies. Today's sequels, remakes, are spectacle movies, and the award shows, performance work is art film. Both keep our interest t with dark majic techniques like effects, celebrities, awards, and mass-marketing. Not surpising this started in the 1970's, which John Wayne described thusly:

>Now the goddamned stock manipulators have taken over. They don't know a goddamned thing about making movies. They make something dirty, and it makes money, and they say, 'Jesus, let's make one a little dirtier, maybe it'll make more money.' And now even the bankers are getting their noses into it.

## Estates General

By 1778, France was in so much in debt, Louis XVI called the "Estate General". A ancient meeting of the "people of the realm". Finally the people cried our voices and pain will be heard. There were three castes. The nobility (400 representatives, 1% of population), the clergy (300 representatives, 1% of population, and the people (800 representatives, 98% of the population).

At question was money. The French government had none. The nobles wanted to raise taxes. The people said what if the nobles and clergy stopped being tax exempt. That's right the rich and powerful didn't pay taxes. The nobles, and (richer) clergy, said why don't we vote on it.

The people said okay, we have more representives, us plus the many priests who lived on the frontline who supported them. The nobles and clergy said

## Charting Storiesss

Here's a legend for the story charts.

![Legend](\../img\breakdowns\story-legend.png)

**Story Organization**
_Old Society_ - The society before the story starts.
_Beginning_ - When the protagonist breaks from society.
_Conclusion_ - The final battle.
_New Society_ - The society after battle.

**Surprises**
_Protagonist philosophy_ - Where the good guy gets his ideas. Where surprising choices come from.
_Antagonist philosophy_ -  Where the bad guy gets his ideas. Where surprising choices come from.
_Free will_ - The time character's have to intrepret his philosophy and do something to win. Small spread is grave danger, big spread is nothing matters, moderate spread is time to think, and a requirement to act.

**Logic/plot**
_The plot_ - The sequence of events. More area means more "logical surprises" are available.
_Build up_ - Long periods when the protagonists suffers, or makes a plan.
_Twist and Turn_ -  When the plot suddenly surprises us and we realize something new.

![Spectacle Story](\../img\breakdowns\story-spectacle.png)
![Functional Story](\../img\breakdowns\story-functional.png)

All stories share the same layers. They just emphasize some over others. Here they are, in their order of importance.

1. Plot: the sequence of reasonable, yet surprising, events between hero and villian. Since whoever controls the tools wins, the plot is usually centered on a tool like the glass slipper in Cinderella, or the One Ring in Lord of the Rings.
2. Protagonist: the person who sees above the ruling philosophy and wants to change the world with a new ruling philosophy. Like Romeo and Juliette bring their families to peace.
3. Ruling philosphy: the antagonist's belief system. The hatred between Capulet's and Montegue's.
4. Antagonist: the person writing the rule book to keep reality the same. Cinderella's step family.
5. Rule book: what people are "officially" allowed to say. Expressed as dialogue in a movie, "Juliette, stay away from Romeo!"; "I love him and I don't care what you say!", but written into laws, regulations, and books in life.
6. Passion: the items people are passionate about, like guitars to a guitarist, or flowers to a romantic.
7. Spectacle: the most visible layer. It's everything we see like clothes, ships, food, explosions, nudity, swords, weapons. Whether props or special effects, these make up the story's typical lifestyle.

Let's see all these layers in a few movies.

## Battle Inside Stories

Let's take a break from Star Wars comparisons for a short while and use another geek story. The Matrix. This story depicts a dystopian future in which most of humanity is unknowingly trapped inside a simulated reality, the Matrix, created by AI machines to distract humans while using their bodies as an energy source. Ne" is recruited to help the few untapped humans rebel against the machines by making the masses inside the Matrix realize their reality is fake.

If you were to look at a good story, here's what you'd see.

![The Matrix](\../img\breakdowns\techvolution-the-matrix-layers.png)

Although increasingly unhappy, the people kept watching the sequels of divine nobility until Rousseau told reminded them everyone starts off equally, thus perpetual heirarchy is bullshit. Until him, the people were too distracted by the spectacle and art of nobles' bad storytelling.

We can sympathize. Become a projectionist and you'll notice most movies today are bad. That's not an opinion, audiences simply don't laugh, cry, and rave much anymore. Yet we still celebrate movie actors as hallowed artists, watch them win awards they give themselves, and pay them millions for their celebrity. Yet, all they do is pretend. It's not that hard. Let them try working insurance.

It's not always their fault. Actors are expected to be award attendees, spokesman, marketers to serve the dark majic of others. Explaining why people like bad stories tells us why the nobles lost their audience and stopped being society's heroes.

## The Road to Techvolution, and the Death of Revolutions

Rousseau changed history by making the people realize they suffered on the frontline because of an old ruling philosophy. Even though French and Americans could read pamplets, newspapers, and books they still couldn't vote. Even though they could use guns to fight for the king's personal glory in wars like The War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714), and The War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748), they weren't allowed to use guns to defend themselve against the king. Even though science starting revealing the truth about Nature, they were told to follow society's religious rules instead. The people's cyborgolgy was held back by Darth King's rules.

The people's demand for change started a revolution, a sudden questioning of a civilization’s ruling philosophy. The American, French and all the other revolutions in the 19th centuries were violent, because the divide between ruling philosophy and frontline society was very wide.

It's a lesson for us. We have to hurry up. Because the longer we wait to update our ruling philosophy to digital tools, the more out of touch the frontline and ruling philosophy gets. The result is needless revolution. All the more reason for a Techvolution now.

Good stories versus bad stories. When I was a projectionist I (and any other) could tell the difference without ever seeing the movie. We just watched the audience's reactions. If they scream, cry, laugh, yell, it's a good story. Even more telling was listening to moviegoers walk out. If they marvelled about twists, turns, and cool lines, you know the story was really good because it turned fiction into reality.

The audience is never wrong. They can't be. Laughing, being surprised, remembering cool lines is not audience's job. They're jobs is only to watch. It's the storytellers job to give its audience emotions and memories.

A story is a sequence of events where a protagonist fights an antagonist to overcome a problem. The fight to change reality happens in three parts. The first is an introduction of problem and characters. The second is the back and forth battle between heroes and villians. The third part is the conclusion, where we find out which side wins.

Stories are thus simply the essential progression of incidents that happen to the hero in pursuit of his one goal. Action scenes, or character performances, are merely spices, only to be added in moderation. Like two boxers adjusting to each other's tactics. Mixing the logic of problem solving, with the surprises of conflict, is how good stories become "logically surprising", and thus fun to watch.

The kind of story doesn't matter. Comedies, dramas, tragedies. As long as the sequence of events is logically surprising, an audience will believe in aliens and space operas, machines and virtual realities, or kings and kingdoms.

Telling the difference between good and bad stories is actually hard. Bad stories can seem legitimate because everything happens in a sequence of events. Since we're living inside a bad story, we need to learn the difference between the bad stories with too much logic, too many surprises, and the good ones with the right mixture of both.

He said the nobility were con artists who hid behind divinity. And equality was natural. He was right, let's really understand why. Equality, and divinity, come and do based no good stories. And survive based on bad stories.

Since we're living inside a bad story, we need to learn the difference between the bad stories with too much logic, too many surprises, and the good ones with the right mixture of both.

**Art:** not about any specific problem. Art films are more about the protagonist, not what problem they overcame or antagonist they defeated. This makes them more like personal journals of "a weirdo growing up " or "suffering through high school". Free from overcoming a problem, and revealing new sides to themselves, art heroes act as they want. The result is very surprising idiosyncractic behavior and storylines with little logic to tie events together. The result is surprising, but illogical, stories.

To maintain interest art stories get weirder and weirder. To fend off critcism, they surround themselves with ever more awards, granduer, and claims of being cultured or being divine. This culture survives by creating superficial social rules for behavior and fashion. Gossip survives as people invariably break these rules and create endless controversy. In Rousseau's time it was liking Beethoven's scandalous music, or not having enough servants.

In our time, you can just watch any entertainment show and count how many time "scandal" or "in fashion" is said.

**Spectacle:** about a obvious problem. Spectacle movies are very logical because the problem is very simple; ie. Godzilla is here, so run like hell and keep running until the movie is over. Since the antagonist is so evil, and the action is so instinctual, there's no room for the protagoinst to reveal new sides of himself and change how the story progresses. The result is logical, but unsuprising, stories.

source of distractions, housing prices....

To maintain interest, spectacle movies keep ramping up props, items, special effects, gore, and rauchiness. They fend off critcism by (falsely) claiming each ramp-up is more popular in mass marketing campaigns. Ex. Most franchise movies, sequels, and remakes.

In our time, you can just watch any infotainment show and count how many time "breaking news" is said.

**Functional:** about a questional problem that divides a rational protagonist and antagonist. Eachs acts to defeat the other, but have time to figure out how. The back and forth storyline give the audience logical surprises, until the conclusion, were we find out if reality will change or not.

Source of equality

There's no way to know which functional stories will reasonate with audiences, but only functional stories can truly reasonate with audiences and become classics. Ex. Cinderella, Romeo and Juliette, The Matrix, Star Wars.

Logic and surprises counter-balance each other. Withholding one makes art films that are often too weird, and withholding the other makes spectacle movies that are often too simple. Functional stories work so well because they mix the two and create "logical surprises". It's why the art/spectacle don't have "spoilers", while we want to "go in fresh" for functional stories. For Techvolusion, and our mission of distributing the power of new tools to the masses, the key difference between stories is their conclusions.


## The Extra's Choice

Now, here's how we apply this Techvolution. Remember we need to empower extras to jump up and decide winners. From their perspective there isn't one story going on, but two people claiming to be society's leaders.

But now, we can help the extras see through bullshit better. Not only can extras use majic to decide which person to support, but she will also know that art and spectacle is a bad sign, while function and equality is a good sign.

Here's how the extras should see their choice. I'll use Sophia as an example again. The fact that Douglass wants to read, while Hugh wanted him not too, means Hugh was Darth Slavery, while Douglass was a Jedi. While Sophia did use majic to tell her to teach Douglass, she fell to the rules of a old ruling philosophy. In addition to majic, the Hugh vs Douglass story had other qualities showcases hero and villian.

Hugh loves never ending hierarchy (represented as a triangle). While, Douglass equality and distributing power (represented as a circle). Hugh lives in a high-society with its own banquet and ball lifestyle, that survives by keeping manual labour in use despite the existence of machinery, education, to do a better job.

And yes, that's the problem we have now, with Darth Blockbuster.

![Sophia's Choice](\../img\diagrams\techvolution-antagonists-protagonists-extras-close-up-douglass.png)

## Our Story

ALl this applies to us too. It's important to note, while Rousseau's followers may have been political free, they were economically poor. Hunger, disease, unemployment, illiteracy, were all rampant. The time was basically "economic anarchy".

Like how society loved the original kings for winning the "King's peace", the original economic kings were heroes for winning massive economic growth. They said follow me, recognize my property rights, let me run the economy, my company's will keep you employed and improve your life with new tools like lightbulbs, and toaster ovens.

Slowly but surely, they did. They told a good story during the Industrial Revolutions. The people were again an audience who watched fiction become reality as we overcame economic anarchy. And we did that with many of the primitive tools of today. Schools, colleges, and universities educated the masses. Gas trucks and cars moved resources and products much faster. Oil and coal powered everything.

Darth Blockbuster's forebears like Andrew Stanton, Andrew Carnegie, Vanderbilt, did what Clovis I and the rest did. And like how Darth King was only exposed when new tools empowered the extras so they didn't need to be peasants anymore, Darth Blockbuster was only revealed when digital tools were so powerful, the extras didn't need to be 9-5 working, consumers anymore.

Our problem today is Darth Blockbuser. He actively chooses to fight against new digital tools changing our way of life. Although we have amazingly powerful new technologies, using these technologies to create new tools is hard. The majic of new digital tools improving everyone's cyborgology is thus rare at home, work, and leisure.

However, prohibiting majic is not Darth Blockbuster's only weapon. He also surrounds himself with art, and distracts the extras with spectacle. Both are bad stories, which require them to ramp up their weirdness, and spectacle, to keep going. The problem solving and equality loving classic stories are put on hold, so that Darth Blockbuster's hold tools can stick around, and keep him in power.

And this same change to art and spectacle started in the 1970's, when digital tools should have been changing our way of life. Here's how John Wayne saw it at the time:

>Now the goddamned stock manipulators have taken over. They don't know a goddamned thing about making movies. They make something dirty, and it makes money, and they say, 'Jesus, let's make one a little dirtier, maybe it'll make more money.' And now even the bankers are getting their noses into it.

The movies kept using ever more spectacle, they turned good stories like Star Wars, Die Hard, Indiana Jones, Predator, Spider-Man, Batman, and so many others, into a never ending list of sequals and remakes, each with higher marketing and production budgest to produce the spectacle that keeps it alive.

The movies, also become ever more artful. When moviemakers weren't selling out to spectacle movies, they compensated for its boring stories, with ever more artful ones. Sundance, Toronto, Cannes and other film festivals celerated films, while the public only watched them walk the red carpet.

This same mixture of spectacle and art expanded through all pre-digital tools in suburbia. Detached homes got ever more spectular, bigger sizes, designer fashion. Cars got bigger, more size, more chrome, more horsepower. Televisions increase in size. All these were used to promote a "Desperate Housewives" suburban lifestyle of drinking win, holding house parties, and being a office worker who didn't do manual labour but talked alot of saving the world via red / blue politics.

All tools that existed pre 1970, grew their spectacle and art to save themselves from being surpassesd by digital tools. Houses didn't come made with solar panels. Cars were not allowed to go electric. Televisions couldn't connect to streaming services. The power of digital tools was withheld from the extras by Darth Blockbuster's majical interference, and with the use of spectualr and artful stories.

And, if we're going to change that, we need to realize all bad stories eventually end badly, so.... shit something is wrong...

## Paramount

Movie theatres struggled because of DVD. Studio's are not allowed to own or even coordinate with movie theatres. It was a rule made in 1948 called the Parmount Consent Degrees. It's the reason why a movie ticket and popcorn are so expensive. Studio's get 80% of the former and theatres live on the latter.

It's also why the studio's loved DVD sales, because they kept most of it themselves.

## Rousseau on Stories

The difference between good stories (classic) and bad stories (art and spectacle) is the difference between magic and dark magic. Good stories attract people themselves, they last forever, and span cultures, because they speak to our natural love of stories and the battle between good and evil.

To keep our interest in bad stories, people use dark magic, non-storytelling methods to keep people interested in art and spectacle stories. Awards, titles, elitist culture or art, and the re-using old icons, names, graphics surrounded by flashy production, of spectacle stories.

There only difference between magic, and majic, is that the the former happens in fictional stories, and the later happens in real life. Notice how much dark majic there is in art films that few people ever watch. Just watch any entertainment award show television coverage and how many time "scandal" or "in fashion" is said, then ask anyone if they saw the films. Few people every do, it's not why their watching.

You can also see the same thing about spectacle and news infotainment. Watch them and you'll see commercials for super-horsepower cars, or prescription drugsfancy new gadgets, and how many time "breaking news" is said with flash letters graphics, dramatic music, and scared faces to understand how these bad stories survive.

## Good and Bad Storiess

Good stories versus bad stories. When I was a projectionist I (and any other) could tell the difference without ever seeing the movie. We just watched the audience's reactions. If they scream, cry, laugh, yell, it's a good story. Even more telling was listening to moviegoers walk out. If they marvelled about twists, turns, and cool lines, you know the story was really good because it turned fiction into reality. Only classic stories every did this.

While some people learn to appreciate art films, and others love the distraction of spectacle, neither created many emotions or raving fans. And they're never wrong. They can't be. Laughing, being surprised, remembering cool lines is not by choice. It's the storytellers job to give its audience new emotions and memories with good stories.

Watching a movie theatre audience is watching the frontline. So when the people rave about art and spectacle stories you know something is wrong. Rousseau was beloved by the people, and hated by the nobility, for noticing the people were raving about spectacle, and thinking the art society was better, instead of being stuck up shitheads.

This was important because one works for equality and democracy, and the other two work to enrich the rich and distract the masses.

## Darth Compact Disc

So let's recap Darth Compact Disc with the above in mind. A new tool let customer's listen to individual songs. Music executive's business model was make two good songs, packaged with 10 fillers, and charged for 12 song CD's.

Internet came. He had no idea what it was, so it was a threat. He sued Napster and won. Internet still a threat. He tries to make a tool from it. Failes. Internet still a threat. Steve Jobs comes to him. Still a threat. Jobs wins anyway.

Darth CD was living a art story. He couldn't solve a problem, making money from the internet, but he didn't want to give up his place as a hero. Thus his story was one of self-importance and complaining about his inability to act. He used spectacle, lawsuits, media interviews, marketing compaigns to try and make CD's stay cool, to try and distract the masses from a better tool.

A hero in a classic story would have let someone else try. Which is what history did, Steve Jobs, and the other people behind iPods, iTunes, and now Spotify.

## Prologue

Yet when I wrote this book I used VS Code, Quora, Wikipedia, Betterworldbooks, and other digital tools for free or just about. When I needed some editing help and cool illustrations it was a click away on 99 Designs and Upwork. No meetings, no resumes, no office politics. I told people my problem, used chat, email, Figma and Word, and boom, like magic, world class drawings and a book that is far more readable. Best yet, I'm not their boss but collaborator.

And I literally live next to a college specializing in creative writing and illustration. Yet the digital economy is easier and cheaper then trying to work with them. They're filled with adminstrators, bureaucrats, and teachers who live to delegate work.

    As a kid I helped my family clean office buildings, warehouses, and factories. My job was to pick up garbages and blueboxes. A simple job I got done before reading PC Gamer. Blue collar people usually cleaned up after themselves. Offices not so much. They didn't like "working beneath them".

    Later on, when I was the working in warehouses, factories, and offices, I saw the same thing. In one office job the cleaners were short staffed. Layers of management spent hours in meetings and eventually emailed out this:

    >We are working through some issues with our office garbage pickup. As a result some of our bins have not been emptied. If you see that the bin is full, please refrain from adding more to the bin. Thank you for your patience. I am working on getting this resolved.

    At nine I had the problem figured out.

    Funny until you realize people who _want_ to delegate work control huge parts of our economy. They like old technology because it gives them the stream of problems they get to manage. And they know digital tools threaten their status.

    Another big motivation for me to write this was it pisses me off red/blue politics seeps into your political conversations and thoughts.

Those philosophies are very old. That's why their supporters yell so much. Ignorant about digital tools solve problems, they keep people interested by giving them drama. What the middle class needs is to become their own heroes with new tools. Ways to understand how their taxes work, analyze why there's so many regulations, and protect their data from being sold to the highest bidder.

## Star Fleet

Here's the breakdown. In the first drawing I wanted the show what happens when humans change their perception because of new tools. With the telescope we saw the Earth moves,and we digital tools we'll see our obession with self-gratification.

So for example, car insurance claim adjusters are often by lied to by bad drivers who swear "the light was green!". With only the liars word to go by, the worker is forced to appease them. But with new tools like dashboard cameras, the truth isn't a person's opinion, but something everyone can see with their own eyes. Hence why the "customer service representative" is discarding the mask and holding the cards.

I'm starting conceptualize the article now, and changed from talking about what new world we'll see with digital tools, to what new world we'll build. So the article is now called "Starting Starfleet".

In summary, I think once we're freed of rampant self-gratication, we'll supercharge people like Elon Musk to build the future, which I'm saying is how "Starfleet" actually starts, and hence what we'll see in the future is ourselves in the stars.

Everything in the image can stay the same. Luckily Star Trek  often showed people playing cards. I just need the image to be wearing a Star Trek uniform, and looking back at us saying "hurry up, the future is so much fun".

## Prologue jpm story

Here's an example of it. As a kid I helped my family clean office buildings, warehouses, and factories. My job was to pick up garbages and blueboxes. A simple job I got done before running off to read PC Gamer or Maximum PC. Blue collar people usually kept a clean workspace. Offices not so much. Salesman, supervisors, and executives insisted on lived on image, and didn't like doing anything "beneath" their position.

Later on, when I was the working in warehouses, factories, and offices, I saw the same thing. In one office job, cleaners were in short supply. Layers of management stared at full garbage bins, spent hours in meetings, and eventually emailed out this:

>We are working through some issues with our office garbage pickup. As a result some of our bins have not been emptied. If you see that the bin is full, please refrain from adding more to the bin. Thank you for your patience. We are working on getting this resolved.

# Prologue Original

I wrote this for the people on GitHub, Bitbucket, Slack, Figma, Sketch, and whatever else you Jedi are working on. Learning the ecosystem of your tools was super cool. Learning your unspoken philosophy was even cooler.

Most people don’t yet know the power of digital tools. It’s too different, like an animal inside a different ecosystem. The fact any person can visit GitHub, go to the Ruby on Rails site, and download it for free is like owning your own newspaper. Not only that, the fact you can see the people who are working on it, what every person did, and when, and even contribute your own help, is a world as different as Cinderella walking into the banquet because she wanted to, not because a fairy said so could.

Open source still can’t run the world. Read The _Innovators_ and Walker Isaacson will explain how the trifecta of academic institutions, private corporations, and the military was perfect to create the digital revolution. Likewise, it was for profit companies, academic institutions, and open-source programmers who kept it going.

But open-source the next step in human evolution. It’s so pivotal because it’s a check and balance to anyone trying to control too much. Darth Blockbuster literally couldn’t stop a few hackers from giving the world internet streaming. A upgrade that’ll we’ll see in the next book actually saved tens of millions of dollars and a few hundred lives (in short, less car accidents).

Even cooler with open-source, work is tracked, ideas are debated, results are shared. Some people are dicks for sure, but nobody thinks they’re a king. People work when and where the want, and we all get and give better results because of it. No uniform requirements. No “BEEP-BEEP” of bell. No boss trying to keep his job relevant with some bullshit marketing meaning. It’s not perfect. Shit happens. But try working elsewhere on the frontline and you’ll see a big difference.

Open-source is the new world. One that I only wanted to learn about. Now I want to liberate. There’s no difference between the soldiers who fought Darth King Charles, George III, or Louis XVI and you, the modern minuteman who doesn’t work for money, but to advance human evolution.

You all feel the “majic” of new tools, yet have a hard time explaining to regular people, because humanity still doesn’t really understand how our “cyborgology” changes us every time we pick up a radio, a smartphone, a lightsaber (one day!).

Another big motivation for me to write this was it pisses me off red / blue politics seeps into your political conversations and thoughts. Those philosophies are older then Cobol, and worth nothing to anyone building the future. They want to keep people watching the news, rather than living their own story. For anyone to become their own hero, they need tools. Way to understand how their taxes work, analyze which politician is voting for what bills, and protect their data from being sold to the highest bidder.

My hope is that with Techvolution, you can better explain why open-source is making the world a better place to extras wondering why you work so hard making Deno, Node modules, Common Voice, or the endless projects piecing together a brighter future like so many Wikipedia articles, one edit now at a time. Terms like “Darth Blockbuster”, “Death Star rule book”, “internet Jedi”, and soon to come “Life Star” put the world in a black and white way, not based on color, but which person gives the people tools to live a better life. Which person fights to let them use tools to improve their lives.

Avoid the red/blue philosophies. They march like its Woodstock in in 1969, because technologically speaking they never want us to move passed 1969. The power of digital tools is completely unseen to them. You could transfer them back in time and they wouldn’t notice. Gas cars, broadcast televisions, 9-5 work days, two car garages homes, retirement savings; their ideal way of life is a never ending The Simpsons episode. Red/blue, equally and without difference, are now self-entitled characters in an art film living a life of banquets and balls.

There are many Darth Blockbuster’s in this class of artists. They live by inheriting the control of DVD stores, accounting companies, insurance brokers, bureaucratic office jobs, and the like. They write rules to stop the hierarchy of old tools sending them back to equality. They do so with the outmost sincerity and conviction that they’re the “martyrs of the people”. The power of digital tools is as lost to them as books, guns, and telescopes was to Darth King. It’s too bad. They’re usually very well-intentioned people, but they’re just way behind the times.

The people are distracted like fans of an old sitcom to notice we don’t get tools to solve our problems. We’re so use to seeing the same political family names, cable news shows, 60 Minute interviews, gas car product logos, to notice our story isn’t a classic one with people overcoming problems anymore.

The aim is simple. When you're talking about your job to a regular person, I want you to be able to say to "I am empowering you with new tools to help you live a better life" with a well deserved confident smile" then adding "and _they_ are holding you back". And if they question who and why, just tell them to read _Techvolution_.

- crowdsourcing
- community forums

- so people keep using his old tools like CD's, DVDs, road maps, lecture halls, gas cars, paper forms, and call-centers because he owns these tools, he profits from these tools, and he has no idea what Javascript is, so he never wants his users to leave and send him back to equality.
- I'm one of them. I'm a lone politics, history, and philosophy geek who spends his days thinking about what's coming next in the story of civilization. With Firefox, Project Gutenberg, YouTube, and Wikipedia I can do my own research. With Markdown, VS Code, and Ghost I can write, design, and host my own work. With Word and Figma I can collaborate with world-class illustrators and writers to make it better. This book is a byproduct of your own ecosystem.
- Open-source isn't perfect. People are dicks, projects die off, politics gets involved. But that's humanity. Open-source works because it gives us freedom, which is the only way human virtues like accountability, ingenuity, and work-ethic flourish.

## Prologue PC Gamer

I helped clean office buildings as kid. Kind of, I just picked up the garbages and blue-bins before reading PC Gamer. Years later when working at a big office, the cleaners were short staffed. Management spent many hours meeting about the "garbage problem". It was funny, if it wasn't another example of the bad story of modern management addiction to petty problems.

Using today's software and open-source philosophy work becomes a good story. People are free to come and go, so each project has to have a clear purpose. All problems, communication, and contributions are in the open, peole can assess where their character is best needed. Free, empowered, peope work have made made tools like Firefox, Linux, and Wikipedia.

## Tesla 

<!-- include this? -->
  Darth Blockbuster is in control. He's dedicated to keeping control. And he's no protagonist. He can't be a hero, because unlike Neo, Cinderella, Romeo and Juliette he's not mentally capable of rising above the situation, and seeing a solution to what he thinks is a fact of life. Cars break down, deal with it. And when someone asks him to solve the problem, his face goes blank. He can't pass that question on the test. He can't run fast enough to make the team. He can't throw a spiral. So his dad comes over and asks the coach to do him a favor on put him on the team anyway. That favour is the rules Darth Blockbuster asks government, corporations, and culture to keep the extras using old tools.

  That's why a small company like Tesla had to bring modern cars to America. They didn't have early access to new technology, different tools, a magic wans. Tesls is run by people who _can_ see problems. They can answer that question on the test, they can run fast enough, they can throw a spiral. So they're father sits proudly in the seats. Darth Blockbuster should be beside him. Yet, he gets to be captain because he pays for it.

## Sample Intro addition

If you don’t like the choir, or you’re starting to realize the “other side” consists of workers like you and that they are a part of the same struggling middle class, you’d probably like to keep reading. Red and blue philosophies may consider you an extra , who’s supposed to read the opinions of columnists, listen to pundits, and vote every few years. But digital tools give everyone the power move from being a TV watching extra, to a hero to be reckoned with.

I want to give you an aha moment. That instead of thinking politics being something you watch, with digital tools and open-source technology and practices, it’s something you can join in and control. Because like in any story, once you’re holding a tool to fight climate change, government waste or any other cause, you’re no longer an extra watching other decide the stories outcome, but the hero making the world a better place.

To participate in politics means embracing the power of digital tools. Which also means accepting that whichever color wins an election this year or the next and re-writes the rules, regular people will still pay taxes, have a huge mortgage, waste hours in traffic, pay increasing energy bills, sleep less than they’re supposed to, buy unhealthy food, watch climate change, overpay for questionable education, get confused by their health insurance, endure customer abuse, work unpaid overtime, get micro-managed by an increasing number of managers, be told by ignorant consultants how to do their work, and hope their job (which they likely hate) isn’t downsized or outsourced.


These people have changed our reality. They are strongly bent on solving real-world problems with technology. They hate the “busy work” of aimless marketing meetings, useless PowerPoint presentations about the “garbage problem,” and confinements within outdated technology because “that’s what the boss knows.” My goal is to help rid our society of old philosophies that hold back the vision of these creators and contributors. My mission is to let you protagonists prosper.

Prosper by removing antagonists in their way, and by filling their ranks with regular middle class people like you. I want to give you an aha moment. That heroic moment like in so many movies when a person realizes only they can improve their lives by stepping up and getting involved. That moment comes when regular people realize with open-source and digital tools, their political power is not in the remote controller deciding which infotainment show to watch. It’s in the smartphone deciding which digital product you’re going to use, fund, or help make.

## Weight Cutting

My only skill that might step me apart to talk about things like ruling philosophies is being damn stubborn yet also incisive. Here’s an example. When I was learning about the sport of Mixed Martial Arts in 2005 a friend told me about “weight-cutting”. MMA fighters are separated by weight and each fighter weighs in about 36 hours before their fight. Fighters dehydrate themselves for their weigh in, and then rehydrate. Weight cutting lets fighters weigh in at 170 on Friday, but fight at 190 pounds for example. It’s sanctioned cheating that’s allowed because the practice has been around for so long it’s considered part of the sport.

But it’s not. Like diving in soccer, weight cutting at first was harmless. It slowly crept into the combat sports over decades. But after decades of using it and watching it, it’s as accepted as gloves, shorts, and spit buckets. It took me all of one second to realize weight cutting was a cancer. All from one comment I overheard my gym teacher say years earlier when the class was weighing ourselves. He said in wrestling his teammates used to make weight by dropping to their underwear. They were trying to gain every advantage, as MMA fighters did.

Most people can’t see through culture easily. The reason to weigh fighters is so they’re equal size. Fighting didn’t start with and is not about who’s the best weight-cutter. Yet it exists nonetheless because most people take what’s given. So MMA fans watch fighters nearly dead walk to “make weight” one day before a cage match. I can’t do math in my head, I can’t read music, I can’t be a professional fighter, but I can tell the bullshit from the reason pretty well.

## Summary

We've come quite a way in the story so far. So let's take a minute and recap what we need to know. I'm going do this with three stories.

The first is from a BBC Earth documentary. Most people know lions hunt together and take down large animals with teamwork while cheetahs use pure speed to run down small prey by themselves. The BBC documentary showed some cheetah's have learned to hunt in groups to take down large animals. Like the audience, their new large prey, particularly ostrich's, are surprised by the new development. The ostrich's pay with their lives because they still don't see cheetahs as a threat. The moral of the story is either the ostrich's will learn or slowly die off.

Onto the next story. Race car driving use to be extremely dangerous. In the 1940's and 50's cars were blazingly fast but incredibly dangerous because nobody knew how to keep them on the road. Centre of gravities were high and the cars would often spin out of control. For example, the 1955 Le Mans race accident killed 83 spectacators when a car engine flew into the stands.

In 1956 a race car driver and engineer named Michael May thought of a solution. He put a giant wing on top of his Porsche race car. It created huge downforce, giving his car far more grip to stay on the road. His better handling won him his first race with a car that was much safer. Seems like a win win doesn't it. Except Porche's factory team got Michael's innovation declared against the rules. It wasn't until 1963 that wings came back into racing, and by the 1970's downforce was heavily studied science in car racing mimicked today with "spoilers" on many performance cars.

Now for the last story. Humanity has many martial arts. Karate, kickboxing, wrestling, jiu-jitsu, judo, and boxing being among the most common today. Each of these disciplines use the same human body, but teach certain techniques like punching or choke-holds to defeat their opponents. When competing each discipline creates rules that say only their techniques are allowed; there's no kicking in a boxing match for example.

In the early 1990's the fight community started to ask whose system system was best: would a boxer beat a kickboxer? What would happen if a wrestler fought a karate guy? What these people were asking is what if we threw away the rule book and just fought a fight.

On reflection, it seems funny that this was an original idea, but before the 1990's people just assumed boxers or wrestlers weren't allowed to fight outside their rulebook. Fighters were supposed to be ideological loyal and pure to their discipline, even if getting their ass kicked in a real fight.

So the fight community threw out all their rulebooks held many "no rules" tournaments; the most popular being the Ultimate Fighting Championship. After several years these tournaments found their answer. No martial art was the best. Meaning the best fighters were ones who trained all disciplines and used whatever technique they thought would defeat their opponent based on the exact moment they were fighting them. A large toolbox of techniques and the open mind to adapt as fast as possible proved to be the best system. This realization was the start of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA). It's so effective its practioners will defeat any other kind of fighter.

Here's what we should take from these three stories. The middle-class has many systematic problems that keep getting worse. Today we often decide our politician based on their "red", "blue", "green" or whatever ideology. And this is why we're getting our asses kicked.

Because we believe in one ideology, we think our lives are governed by the ideological rule book. Even though all of today's ideologies centuries ago. The answer to what's best is "mixed ideological politics". Meaning not having loyalty to one ideology, but to only care about problem-solving.

That's what Techvolution is. It's a rebellion inside your mind that realizes you are a lifeform in Nature, and thus no rule apply except those that help you solve practical everyday problems. Humans evolve with tools, so your job is to solve frontline pain to evolve life on Earth. And when someone says you're not allowed you have to fight back, even if only in your mind, because they are just being assholes. 


That's why Techvolution is. Is the rebellion inside your mind that says life isn't a ideological fight anymore than a streetfight is a boxing match. The truth is all lifeforms are free to use whatever means neccesary to win in Nature. Thus no rules apply that don't help you live a better life. Since humanity evolves with tools, new tools should be protected and allowed to prospser based on how valuable the people no involved, the extras, find them. Until Techvolution is our ruling philosophy, our society will keep supressing new ideas like a spoiler on racing car, and end up being like ostrichs running away instead of evolving a solution.

## Summary 2

We've come some way in the story Stargazer. So let's take a minute and recap what we need to know. I'm going do this with three stories.

The first is from a BBC Earth documentary. Most people know lions hunt together in prides and take down large animals with teamwork while cheetahs instead use pure speed to catch small prey by themselves. Well, some cheetah's have learned to hunt in groups to take down large animals.Their new large prey, particularly ostrich's, are surprised by the adaptation. The ostrichs are paying with their lives because they still don't see cheetahs as a threat. The moral of the story is either the ostriches will learn or slowly die off.

Onto the next story. Race car driving used to be extremely dangerous. In the 1940's and 50's cars were blazingly fast but nobody knew how to keep them on the road. Centre of gravities were high and the cars would often spin out of control. For example, in the 1955 Le Mans race, 83 spectacators died when a car flew into the stands after a crash. Car racing was banned in several countries because of the disaster.

In 1956 a race car driver and engineer named Michael May thought of a solution. He put a big wing on top of his Porsche race car and pointed it down. The downforce gave his car far more grip to stay on the road. His better handling won him his first race with a car that was much safer. Seems like a "win win" doesn't it. Except Porche's factory team got Michael's innovation declared against the rules. The attack on innovation worked until 1963 when another driver bucked the rules and used the wing again. By the 1970's downforce was heavily studied science in car racing, becoming so iconic it's mimicked today with "spoilers" on performance road cars.

Now for the last story. Humanity has many martial arts: karate, kickboxing, wrestling, jiu-jitsu, judo, and boxing being among the most common today. Each of these disciplines use the same human body but teach certain techniques like punching or choke-holds to defeat their opponents. Each discipline creates rules so only their techniques are allowed in competitions; there's no kicking in a boxing match for example.

In the early 1990's the fight community started to ask whose martial art would win a real fight. On reflection, it seems funny that this was an original idea, but before the 1990's people just assumed boxers or wrestlers weren't allowed to fight outside their rulebook. Fighters were supposed to be ideologically loyal to their discipline, even if getting their ass kicked in a real fight.

After hosting many "no rules" tournaments, the most popular being the Ultimate Fighting Championship, the fight community found the best martial art. None of them. Or, all of them. Meaning the best fighters were ones who trained all disciplines and used whatever technique they thought would defeat their opponent based on the exact moment they were fighting them. A large toolbox of techniques and an open mind to adapt proved to be the best martial art. This realization was the start of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) which is so effective its practioners will defeat any other fighter.

Here's what we should remember from these three stories. The middle-class has many systematic problems. Today we think a red or blue ideology will solve them. We fight each other with arguments of "free-market" versus "government regulation" with honest intentions of improving the world. We even elect and evaluate our government representatives based on ideological purity; not how effectively they helped solve our real-world problems.

And this is why the middle class keeps getting our asses kicked. Because we care about rule books and not results. But Nature doesn't care about rule books. It cares about quick adaptions. The cheetah's learned that, the ostriches are trying to, and we learned it when realizing MMA is the best martial art.

That's what Techvolution is. It's a rebellion inside your mind that says life isn't a ideological fight anymore than a streetfight is a boxing match. That doesn't mean we burn all past knowledge. MMA fighters can still learn from kickboxers. Likewise, red/blue ideologies can teach us things the same way ancient philosophies and religions can. But none of them should be the ruling philosophy when working or electing a government.

Only results should be. And to see results we have to use digital tools to transform our entire way of life. That means Techvolution.

Human life won't be a utopia with Techvolution as a ruling philosophy. Evolution is hard work. It requires feeling frontline pain and finding a solution with a new adaptation. But once we're free to do that, in our mind and in society, we'll start to actually see results. And to boot, work will mimick open-source; being less about delegators and garbage meetings, and more about workers and contributions.

Ideologues often scream out "socialist" or "intolerant" to re-inforce their beliefs. We should still ignore this marching band, but we can still learn something from them. We've all seen antagonists not allow telecommuting, force workers to use old tools they understand, or spend hours on garbage meetings. Until we start to call out "Darth Blockbuster" problem solving innovations, even simple ones like spoilers on racing cars, will keep being suppressed by the Sith's Death Star rule book. Meaning middle-class problems will pile-up like ostrichs getting caught by cheetahs. Except it'll be our heads in the sand.

To win the war Stagazer, we have to blow the Death Star.

## The Power of Philosophies Is Either to Hold Us Back or Push Us Forward

Why must philosophies be revamped? Let me explain with a little more history. Our philosophies can only be as good as what we can prove. Of course, philosophers can debate and argue all day long about whatever they want; they aren’t on the frontline trying to make a living as a fisherman, seamstress, or welder. The people need a ruling philosophy to organize their daily lives, and for everyone to believe in a philosophy, it must make sense to everyone and help them live a better life.

Thus, when in ancient Greece Aristarchus of Samos said the Earth moved around the Sun nobody believed him. Instead they believed Aristotle who said the Earth stood still. A moving Sun made more sense to people, because for one, it looks like it moves, and two if the Earth moves, why can’t we see the stars move their position in the sky. The answer that they’re extremely far away is impossible to see with the eye, and nearly impossible to imagine. Thus, the average person sided with Aristotle because he made more sense. Especially because back then people navigated by the stars, and it’s easier to assume the Earth is stationary when doing so. Even today’s nautical maps are based on a motionless Earth.

Of course, everything changed when Galileo invented the telescope during the Renaissance. Although since rich and powerful were followers of Aristotle and refused to look threw it, the telescope let everyone else see, and therefore believe, the Earth moves. As the telescope got better and cheaper, society’s ruling philosophy switched from the “geo-centrism” of Aristotle, to the “helio-centrism” of Aristarchus.

You might scoff at people who refused to accept the Earth moves. But that’s the difference new tools have on our ruling philosophy. Whatever philosophy makes sense to most people gets their support; especially when it also improves their lives. Helio-centrism made more sense to telescope empowered people, and it improved daily life with better calendars, mathematics, and physics. Thus, the people used it as their ruling philosophy. The lesson is we update our philosophy to the capabilities of new tools.

In 2019, we have the same problem. The telescope showed us a dazzling universe. Now we’re no longer happy to just look at it. We want to explore it. But space travel isn’t just cool; it’s a vital next step in humanity’s evolution. Reaching for the stars means better satellites, worldwide internet accessibility, and ensuring intelligent life doesn’t put all its eggs in our one earthly basket. Getting off the planet requires an affordable lift-off.

It was private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin (funded by a few rich guys) who answered the call and constructed some relatively cheap rockets. To make them cheap enough to change the course of human history, these rockets also had to be reusable. This was no small feat, especially for SpaceX; their Falcon 9 rockets were seven stories high and would have to launch into space, land back on Earth, and relaunch all over again.

SpaceX tried several times and kept failing. But on December 22nd, 2015, they did it! They succeeded in the incredible achievement of landing a rocket. This was hailed as one of humanity’s greatest milestones by SpaceX’s fans who realize the importance of advancing technology. But many people, especially politicians, didn’t care.

When you’re obsessed with old philosophies, you’re also confined to its old tools and lived within its old narratives. Today the red/blue philosophy obsesses over tax cuts, government regulations, and media soundbites because those are the tools their philosophy says to fight over. New and super-powerful technologies like SpaceX are just a novelty act that fall beyond the practitioners of old philosophies comprehension and comfort zones. Like the telescope was to the followers of Aristotle.

That’s the power of a ruling philosophy. It filters out the good and bad for people in everyday life. But we need to update the ruling philosophy when new tools change how everyday people live their life. Today, we need a new philosophy that harnesses our new innovative and powerful digital tools so we can improve life on, and beyond, Earth.

## Terms of Reading

There are none. I don't know which license to use yet, but it'll be an open-source one. I don't have any trackers or website counters. My way to tell if this book is being read, is if our politics transforms to be about who contributed to fighting climate change or increasing social capital more as tracked and verified by open-source software, instead of yelling matches and sob stories about whose to blame for humanity's problems.

If I helped bring about that transformation, then I'm happy.

I would ask to read with an open mind. The future isn't going to bring along all of our current philosophies, ideals, opinions and gripes about the past. There's isn't room to pack things like "colonialization is to blame", or "those damn communists ruined everything with the New Deal". Let our descendants debate those questions if they're so important.
I'm more worried about packing our descendants a better planet to take into the future. That means people today are going to be, one way or another, shedding lots of baggage. People only think it's important to pack all our histories, languages, customs, and traditions because we don't realize our power to decide what we should bring.

If you're loyal to your way of life, that's fine, then show how it contributed more to earn your loyalty to get an outsiders respect.

All of us are too use to taking the way of life we've been given. Yet there's no monarchs, tyrants, devils to blame for our problems anymore. Digital tools gives the people the power to decide our fates. And with power comes responsibility because we can't blame the past for the world we give the future.

So there's no terms to reading. No number is high enough to compensate for the better future we threw away unless Techvolution, or something similar or better, replaces our ruling philosophy.

## Things Won't Get Better, Until

Most of our problems started in the 1970s for a reason. That’s when protagonists created digital tools, and Darth Blockbuster showed up with his Death Star to keep our Woodstock era way of life unchanged. Despite a plethora of new tools, the "American Dream" is still to live in a post-World War II baby boomer suburb.

I'm going to keep repeating this because it's so easy to forget; better tools are out there. We'd majically connect with them to solve our problems if we didn't believe in old philosophies that said their old tools like gas cars and The Oscars were our (supposed) culture, or if new tools weren't against "the rules".

Look at education. We kill ourselves to be admitted into colleges and universities. We use up years of our young lives wrapped in coursework. Our politics uses up so much attention with funding, subsidies, loan agreements, teacher strikes, school shutdowns. And yet at after graduation so many media studies, English, and yes even political science grads never look at their courework again.

All the while Wikipedia, YouTube, Khan Academy, Udemy, Skillshare, Curiosity Stream, Brilliant, Project Gutenberg, The Great Courses, do wonderful jobs while costing a tiny fraction of formal education. Yet, we don’t teach kids to read or update Wikipedia in schools. We don’t track student progress in Khan Academy’s micro-lessons. We don’t recognize "degrees" from Udemy, or YouTube, even though most computer programmers and designers learn far more there than in any college classroom. Yet we assume a stamp of university "graduate" is like getting a perpetual ticket to the ball as a member of some sort of royalty.

Those balls only last so long. Eventually the tools we use have to help us live a more efficient life. I used digital tools to write this book and never once looked back at my university lecture notes. Not out of malice, there's much knowledge there, but reading through notes scribbled on paper takes too long, so despite spending all those years writing, that knowledge is slowly fading away.

This mix match between available tools, and the ones we use in everyday life is a major problem. We aren't adapting but stagnating. Like the poor polar bears unable to foresee the Artic's ice decline, the more we wait to adapt, the more time we'll have to make up until we're basically be like polar bears trying to live in the Amazon.

Our society suffers keeping the old philosophies of the baby-boomer suburban dream alive. Despite way too much carbon in the atmosphere, gridlocked roads, housing bubble bursts, massive student debt, our politics keeps us using gas cars, mass produced homes with no solar panels, super-expensive college education, and very confusing health insurance. Our entire frickin climate is changing because our ruling philosophy is not.

Things like middle class quality of life, political cooperation, and climate change, won’t get better until the extras join the protagonists, step-up to the antagonists, and freely use digital tools to solve frontline problems. To change our cyborgology, we need Techvolution. Without it, we have a mix-match using tools with basically be polar bears trying to survive in the Amazon.

## IDK random

Digital tools were a totally new tool. One that the ruling philosophy didn't know how to handle. It was in the 1970’s Darth Blockbuster showed up and started making his Death Star.

Writing contracts nobody can understand, regulations nobody can find, and enforced politically correctness nobody likes. Despite a three million perfect increase in computer power, our society has more traffic on our roads, we drive more miles every year, we see our friends and families less and less, we have less trust in government every year, and our carbon emissions are so high the planet is actually burning.

All of this is because we can't adapt solutions to these problems because it's against the rules. Our old philosophies, who ignore the possibilies of digital tools, blame each other. Look at this graphic below and notice how the divine between red and blue started in the the 1970's, and as our problems multiply, has only gotten worse.

## Soulful Connections

I think first dates are amazing. Even the generic dinner and movie ones are wondrous. Sitting there in your nice sweater, eating a medium steak, sipping water, and across from your maybe Romeo or Juliette. In a few days, you might use your soul to prevent even a frown on this stranger's heavenly face. Such is the power of romances.

This date moment might in fact end with a five year divorce with true accusations of infidelity where you eat beans for breakfast, bitters for lunch and dinner, and see your kids once a week; your own offspring thinking you're a stranger because of this demon. Such is the power of tragedies.

In truth, most stories are somewhere in between these two extremes; but that's beside the point. The point is every story starts with a connection. If human life is a tapestry of stories, both grand and small, we have to understand how we make and keep people connected to their stories.

It's question of reason. A connection is made when a story is held in a story that's unexpected enough to be interesting, yet reasonable enough to be understood. People, viewers, readers, don't have to be conscious of every element. A good story takes a person over. That's why we often loose ourselves to a romance or a tragedy.

So to get someone connected to a story, we must make them happy. Easy enough. Everyone likes happiness.

That's easy to know, hard to achieve. Your Juliette could think your a loser. Your Romeo might be ignoring your text messages. The point is we can't make happiness, we can't force a connection. Happiness in a fictional story is a magical connection between you, and the story. Happiness in life, is a majical connection between you and your friends, family, job, products, leader, and society, that forces a person to stay inside a story.

Happy stories are wonderful, it's why people seek them out, but in fictional stories of first dates, and real ones too. So the question is, are you happy with your story Stargazer?

I don't ask because I care—I do of course—I ask because it's important. You are the audience of the today's society. If you don't like it, that only means society is edging towards not a beautiful romance, but a awful tragedy.

## A World Without Majic

Stargazer, let's recap your mission. We have to fight for Techvolution, first and foremost in your head. Techvolution says the most important political right and responsibility is to use digital tools to solve your frontline problems without anyone getting in your way. The open-source community gives us the ability to make our own products.

Because humanity isn't perfect, we need to make rules from the ruling philosophy to organize society. People with the power to make the rules, sometimes use their power to make-up rules that benefit their self-interest, for which we call them Darth Blockbuster, and we call his fake rule book the Death Star because it gets in the way of humanity's natural evolution.

For the middle-class to prosper once again, we must blow up this Death Star. To find it we learned about majic; which is the natural yearning to learn and teach new tools and add them to our cyborgology. If we feel majic, we know no rule in its way is just, and therefore must be part of the Death Star we're out to destroy.

Therefore the Death Star and your happiness are opposites. The unhappier you are, the less humanity is adapting, and therefore the more of a Death Star there must be around you. The happier you are, the less of a Death Star there is, because humanity is evolving. Your happiness isn't the flashy products, awards, or recognition, those are cool but only give temporary smiles. You happiness is the freedom to adapt. Basically life without a Death Star is a rational one, where stresses are practicl problems all lifeforms understand like finding water supplies or shelter. With the Death Star life is being forced to do stupid things like commuting two hours to work, or pretend to be interested in a five hour garbage meeting.

So that's our mission then is to destroy today's Death Star. How big do you think it is?

let's recap your mission. You have to promote human evolution, which means  using new and better tools on the frontline at home and at work. This is especially important because our politics is distracted fighting over old tools like regulations and tax codes, leaving old industries to defend against the digital revolution by making digital tools against the rules, which we call the Death Star because it holds back evolution. Majic, a cheeky way of saying the natural love to learn and spread new tools is the counterforce to the rules. We follow the rules to be safe, we follow majic to be happy. Thus to blow up the Death Star, means to increase your happiness on the frontline solving your problems as you see fit.

## Civil War Stats

And the world is worth fighting for. There's so much good going on. Our hectic lifestyles can and infotainment can make it seem like all is lost. Disregard that bullshit. The world is getting better.

For one, it's very safe to live today. The amount of us dying violent deaths has consistently decreased. In the Stone Age, about 10-20% of people died violently, most often by murder. In Rome’s peak civilization it was around 2-5%. In the Dark Ages it was above 5%. But by the 18th century, when the Industrial Revolution started, it went well under 5%. Now, less than 1% of us die violently. All those figures are worldwide and include wars. Poverty reduction is down too. In 1990 36% of the world lived in extreme poverty. In 2015 it was 9.9%. With similar trends, we're eliminating illiteracy, diseases, and hunger throughout the world.

More good news. Digital tools keep getting more powerful too. Look at microchips, the "brains" of a computer. In 1972, we could put 3,000 transistors on a microchip. In 2018 we put 10 billion. In 46 years, we’ve increase computer power by three million percent.

These are just a snippet of a mountain of great news so many hard working scientists, craftsman, volunteers fight for every day. All these positive indicators are Techvolution's Life Star, we'll get to meet later on.

Now for the bad news. Despite a three million perfect increase in computer power, our society has more traffic on our roads, we work longer hours, cost of living is up, we see our friends and families less, we have less trust in government. Overusing these old tools is emitting so much carbon emissions our planet is burning. All this started in the 1970's, when human evolution to the possibilities of new tools was held back by the antagonists.

1**GRAPHS**

Here's the worst trend. Despite all the good trends, our problems won't get better because they're caused by our politics. Our official political ideologies are stuck in a blame fest. They're like a pre-MMA boxer or wrestler, who can't understand their ideological rulebook isn't the only game in town, and thus they blame the other side for "cheating" or "being ignorant" instead of embracing the evolution mantra "admit defeat and learn", something they could do with mixed philosophy politics. Instead they dig their heels in and chance political collapse and civil war.

Blue red hatred - Congress

Since the 1970's red and blue increasingly hate each other. Note, the red and blue color code for progressives and conservaties changes in USA, Canada, Austrialia, United Kingdom, but the trend is the same.

As a quick aside, this is a fucking horrible trend. Two halves blaming each other when they're both equally at fault is edging us towards political breakdown and civil war. Perhaps a bit dramatic, but what other choices do commited ideologue's have; realize their errors and apologize for the past thirty years of mud-slinging, or dig in their heels and fight it out.

## ~~Revolution~~ Techvolution

Stargazer, you look disappointed. You think revolutions are fun. You want to follow _Les Misérables_ and march in the streets. Maybe we should. You get the bristol boards, I’ll get the paint, and we’ll change the world! Free college education! Less bank regulations! Affordable health insurance! Continuous tax cuts! We’ll save the planet _and_ the government’s credit rating!

Listen to me. When your cars breaks down, you call a mechanic for help, right? If he showed up with no tools, you’d get mad. You wouldn't ask his reasons for not bringing tools, nor would you discuss the weather with him. You needed "Mike the mechanic" to show up and solve your problem. Without the tools he's just "Mike the person", and frankly useless to you.

Middle class people have a host of problems like increasing insurance, prescription drug, and tutoring bills. You need solutions. When someone says they can help, you must ask what tool they have, or will give you, that will help. Anything else is smoke and mirrors. You don’t need to see regulations, laws, or blog posts anymore then you need to see the mechanic’s favorite car repair manual. You need tools.

Red/blue philosophies show up with no tools. Not because red/blue leaders and supporters don’t care. But because their philosophies don’t know better. Stuck on old tools, they tell the middle class to walk to the nearest gas station and hope for help, and they promptly blame the opposing political party when we complain.

That’s not horrible, until you consider that with a new digital car, like a Tesla, our broken cars can now call the mechanic, give him a diagnostic to his smartphone immediately, and he’d be able to tell what the problem is, and most importantly, tell the scared person the side of the road, what to do next.

Now consider it’s often against the rules to solve our problems so simply. Patent laws, insurance regulations, nondisclosure agreements, non-compete clauses; a mountain of rules any antagonist can search through so he can force us to keep walking to gas stations.

We must realize how much new digital tools help. Here’s an exercise to do it. Every time you want to watch a Netflix show or YouTube video, get in your car, drive five miles, wait 10 minutes, throw away six bucks, drive back home, and then press play. Watch the movie and do it again within 24 hours or get charged a late fee. Easy to forget, but that’s what renting videocassettes and DVDs was like.

Netflix was a big victory. But a rare one. Today, how we pay taxes, recognize education, repair electronics, transfer home ownership, decide our investments, sign sales contracts, get hired, fire someone, use warranties, access medical records, and so much more, works like how we rented a DVD. An unnecessary and expensive pain in the ass enforced by a Death Star of rules. It echoes the philosophy that preached to our ancestors that voting, reading science books, and owning a musket were all against the rules. Totally bullshtt, a veil made by con-artists.

Ignore red/blue's romaticism of revolutions! Use Techvolution to truly change the world. Let the people choose whichever tools best solve your problem. Digital tools and their many Jedi innovators, coders, technicians, designers, repair shops, are ready and waiting to solve real-life problems; it’s intoxicating to them. We just need a new philosophy, giving us the freedom to choose the best tools to solve our problems at home, work, and leisure. The people majically bonding with whatever tool they want, is the ultimate ~~revolution~~ Techvolution.

## The Anti-Death Star

Political philosophy is often called "visions of the just and good society". Every political philosophy imagines a world "classic stories" where the leaders are selfless and use their powers to benefit the community.

Socrates and Plato called these heroes the "philosopher kings", Aristotle called them "". Machiavelli called them a "educated prince". They each in their own way admonished selfish leaders, people who I called the Sith. None, not even my favorite Rousseau, could make a political philosophy that, when applied inside a rule book, killed the Sith forever.

The repeating story of civilization has been a society that embraces a ruling philosophy lead by true heroes using new tools to better their societies like Clovis I and George Washington. But eventually the story shifts. The leaders become self-important like Darth King Charles, and Darth Blockbuster and use spectacle to distract the masses.

Thus, even after the Jedi won, it wasn't long before the protagonists and antagonists again fought over tools, and the extras are stuck in between trying to figure out who the bad guys were.

So asking you to pick the right side? How can the people ever get it right.

That's why I never planned on writing this book. I only wrote this book to wipe all old philosophies and their rule books away. The people who don't understand the SpaceX landing a rocket is more important than any regulation reforms. That health-insurance doesn't mean a healthy population. That to advance humanity we need to let us majically advance our cyborgology any way we want.

Because the truth is, the Sith only survive because we have "visions" of a just and good society. Digital tools let's use actual see these visions and apply them to common senses.

Techvolution is the next ruling philosophy. It empowers seamless human technological evolution by ridding Darth Blockbuster of his power, by empowering extras to decide when society should upgrade our tools.

But it does so not with a rule book written by me, you, a manager, or a president. It does so with what I said at the very start every story is about. A new tool that changes the game. The only thing that can forever kill the Sith is a tool. A tool I say.

And what is this tool?

- i wrote this book to tell you what this new tool will do, and how it will be designed. It's a tool of perpetual stories, with heroes who overcome problems and return to equality without a fight.
- The political question of every time period was the same, are we going to change society to make the best use of new tools. And for use today, we're faced with the same question.
- the differetn stories, of classic, art/spectcle never understand each other. There's no common sense, sense as in the actual sense pain or smell, because their cyborgology is different. Not until the selfish rulers cause so many problems on the frontline, did enough people ignore the spectacle to demand change in the name of a new ruling philosophy designed to distribute the powers of new tools and thereby upgrade human's cyrborgology to solve back log of problems. Sometimes this huge outburts as in France, or small as in England.
- The point is, it's not possible to cross these stories. Power corrupts. Not everyone, but once it finds a host in human greed and short sightedness, getting it out is very hard, because the Death Star really exists. Its mountains of theology, or families bloodlines or inheritances and jurisprudence.
- The key then is give everyone a common sense to feel the pains of society, so the extras are not distracted by spectacle as the leaders ramp up the spectacle to mask their selfishness.

So come Stargazer, with your mind wipe clean up old philosophies and human written rule books, we can now find true answers to the human condition as we tear the mask of Nature, and stare into the face of God. While the Sith survive from their Death Star, we will kill them by a tool the Jedi can control, the Life Star.

- we've used stories to understand these ideas, and here's another, the please join us next week for the sequel, Life Star.

## A Fight Over No Tools

- stories can be big, or small, but each is structured the same....

So do you think Darth Blockbuster is dead? Do you think he'll ever die?

Do you feel the weight of the questin on your shoulders, Stargazer. Do you feel it—the weight of the world? The mantle of fate? As we create a new philosophy to rule our society's deepest definitions of right and wrong in all areas from politics to economics?

You shouldn't.

At the start of this journey, I told you characters fight over tools. In every story from The Illiad to Star Wars, the character who holds the tools is the victor who writes the rules.

So what tool have I given you to defeat the Sith?

Sure it's easy to mock Darth King Charles. It's easy to mock Darth Blockbuster. We have the cyborgology of history books and news articles to see their stupidity.

But who is the Darth in your life that'll you'll stand up to and saw "Hey listen asshole, clean out the garbage can and let someone else take command".

For Techvolution to be real, that has to happen.

The ruling philosophy hasn't been updated since America ran on dirt roads. It assumes unexplored horizons filled with wilderness that needs to be tamed in a land rush. Economic growth was paramount, hallowed in our culture protected in our rule book.

That's not the world we live in. We know America is 330,000,000 square miles. We know what resources there are. Growth has stopped. Now we need efficiency. Yet without a new ruling philosophy the salesman, the brokers, the spenders, are prioritized over the makers, the savers.

In 1973, when Gordon Moore said "We are really the revolutionaries in the world today—not the kids with long hair and beards who were wrecking the schools a few years ago." Most of the world's electronics was researched, designed, and made in America. Within twenty years that was barely the case.

That was the watershed moment in Western societies. The digital revolution didn't come with a political one. Rather than using digital tools to transform American, we exported America to keep old philosophies alive. We should have changed to obess about efficiency.

But that wasn't what corporate aristocracy knew how to do. Without a new ruling philosophy they went for the self-importance of performance art and the spectacle to distract the masses. That's why gas car brands multiplied, models were "redesigned" every year, all so the marketers, salesman and brokers had ever more ammo for their garbage meetings.

They rejected digital tools for the same reason kings rejected science books and people owning muskets. It meant there was nothing left to manage.

- success of the ruling philosophy, jumlbes the definition of success. it is serving hte heirarchy of the new tools, or making even newer tools? when does a story jump the shark?

All the while American should have been making Tesla's, and even better, started to build communities were digital tools like telecommunications over jam packed roads and mental illness inducing traffic.

When the spectacle would wear off on frontline people suffering in the "rust belt", the answer was always to bring in new people. Hence why I was cleaning office buildings as a kid. It was always easier to clean up after blue collar workers, they took pride in their workstations and stuff. Office workers had positions, so didn't like working "down".

They used a Death Star rule book to help themselves have meetings, and keep the workers away.

So how can the workers on the frontline fight back?

Techvolution in their hearts, but that still needs tool. So what's a tool to help the workers?

## Plot Twist Excess




My only insight to write Techvolution is the story of civilization. Which is that that tools are what driving force behind all human events. And that tools grow and adapt like any biological lifeform. The first step is very competitive as lifeforms spread as fast as they can in a winner takes all battle. The winners mark their territory, plants set their roots, animals roam and protect their territory, and once the lifeforms are secured, do they settle downa nd start to life a regular life. As they life, they then start to adapt to the area.

And here is when lifeforms stop competiting and start collaborating inside ecosystems. An ecosystem has borders and a strict divide between members and non-members, locals and foriegners. Locals know the game, and they settle down into a flow. This way each can harvest resources in a special way, and pass on the resources to another lifeform in the ecosystem. The constant flow keeps all lifeforms in check and balance, and makes sure they're all adapting even though there's no natural disaster to adapt to. There has to be members and non-members otherwise the lifeforms couldn't work together. That's why foreign species, like..., are so devastating. They simply don't know the rules of the ecosystem's game.

And this transition from competition, winners takes all, to the collaboration of an ecosystem, happens to human society's too. But with tools. When things are barren and desperate, our cybogology is weak, and thus we form strong hierarchies around the few people (protagonits) who control the few tools/adaptions. If the tools evolve, they get stronger, and thus more of the people can also evolve, and become their own protagonists. When enough people are protagonists, they're lifeforms, they need to switch over from the competition phase, to the collaboration phase. This is why after the Thirty Years War, humanity put up borders around their countries. They were forming an ecosystem, with members and non-members, so that they could collaborate.

Then we kept evolving, and when our tools were economic, we again spread them in the competition phase throughout the globe, and followed the early protagonists. But as economic tools evolved, more people could become protagonists, which is what happened in the 1970's and digital tools. And once enough of use were empowered by digital tools, we wanted to form ecosystems, economic this time, so we could collaborate. which is why Brexit, and Trump's election were so predictable and inevitable. The story of civilization is something we don't have a handle on, but it's the story of evolution simply with tools and humanity. Growth in a competive phase, then collaboration inside ecosystems. But humanity is like a blank canvas of lifeforms. We fill in the roles of lifeforms, and morph as required...

And this is what I'd tell a European peasant before hte Thirty Years War. They wouldn't understand it. So I'd tell them to be selfish. "What are you getting" if a protestant/catholic king wins. They'd respond with some dark majic answer about getting a better church, or going to heaven. Then I'd ask him to show me his daily life. And he'd show me his trip to the well everyday where he walks 10 litres of water to bring back to his house. He'd show me his manually labour cutting hay for his horses. And he'd show me this and that. And i'd tell him "the only thing you need to fight for, and better tools, better water systems, toilets, heating, insulation, because that's the only way God's creatures fight off the Devil, the rest is all talk."

He still wouldn't understand. He'd be like so many in the Milgram experiemtn and simply follow authority figures who think they're protagonists, but are really Lucifers. He wouldn't have the benefit of so much hindsight.

You do. All you have to do, is seek out digital tools to improve your life.Be selfish, because every animal in teh world is selfish, and that's what evolution is. That means we'll start to form economic ecosystems so we can collaborate. Some of that will be online, but most will have borders. It's the only way our social problems will get solved. Like overthrowing the antagonist kings, its going to happen.

The economic ecosystem, walls, tarrifs, nationalism, us vs them mentality, will go against the world ecosystem, hands across blahhh....

I just hope we don't live through a Thirty Years War, before we realize we were fighting the wrong fight.

## The Climax

Remember we said about that island. Humanity would have a set biology. The gullible and the stubborn would go back and forth, being loyal to the hierarchy, then rebelling to start a new one.

Where do you think you are? Well we can test for that.

Watch this video. It's a real experiment. It's about a test subject volunteering for a how does pain affect learning. The volunteer is a "teacher" who asks the "student" memory questions, for every wrong answer the teacher gives the student a shock of increasing shock. The student's really an actor, but the teacher thinks it's real.

Let's recap this. It's this entire book in a microcosm. There's an authority figure, a protagonist, who controls a tool, the teaching machine, who teaches it to an extra to better learn how people learn. The extra agrees this is a good reason and majically learns how to use this tool. As the teacher uses the tool there's a breaking point where he wants to stop. The authority figure responds with dark majic, and it works so damn well the teacher kills 50% of the time.

Notice though, most people want to stop before then. It's the authority figure that eggs them on. With Techvolution, we remove (as much as absolutely possible) the authority figure, and thus the teacher works with the student, and both agree to stop when the work is no longer contributing to a answer.

What this experiment, and so many others show, we have no idea how and why we make our decisions. And political decisions? We act on impulses we don't understand.

And those differences are way I wrote this book. Not because Techvolution is the new philosophy we need, but because it's the last ruling philosophy we'll need philosophy. It would be great to skip right to it. But we're getting it regarless and that's going to be scary. Because most people are under a dark majic belief system that wont hold up to what the tools of the future will show us. And digital tools will show us who we really are, and put is to a test, as we going to adapt or not.

## Thought Experiment - Biological Life

When does a species become foreign? The most obvious example are invasive species such as python's that ravaging Florida, or the Emerld Ash Borer that's killing North America's ash trees. There's a particular moment when a species is no longer welcome.

Imagine an island comes up from the ocean. Nothing but barren rock with no signs of life. There's nothing around it. No life means no ecosystem. It's a land rush. Any life is welcome. Whoever comes first and sets up their roots and marks their territory will adapt themselves to the barren area. As new lifeforms arrive, they have to find their place, which increasingly means finding a niche of resources no other lifeform is making use of.

There'd be waves of new lifeforms. Plants would make an ecosystem. Then insects would arrive. Then reptiles and mammals etc. Assuming there was no natural disasters killing off all lifeforms new lifeforms would keep arriving.

Eventually though, enough lifeforms would adapt they'd be no more room left. All opportunities to harvest resources would have a dedicated lifeform to harvest them, and lifeforms will exist depending on each other. Flowers will bloom expecting there to be bees, and bees will expect there to be flowers. A ecosystem will form. A system of checks and balances betweeen lifeforms who barely know each other who all exist because of their shared food web.

So when does a species become foriegn?  When an ecosystem is up and running. The exact moment is hard to know, but it exists. That's one thought experiment. The realization that life starts as a land rush, and at one point a ecosystem is established, and lifeforms are either members or non-members. Now let's do this again with technological life.

## Thought Experiment - Technological Life

Now add humanity to this imaginery island. Not modern humanity, but our ancestors from around the Stone Age. So we wouldn't be the first to arrive. The island would have had millions of years to establish a biological ecosystem. How would we integrate into this ecosystem.

We would be foreign species. We'd gather resources, but also harvest our own. We'd adapt the ecosystem to accomodate us. We'd farm the plants we want, and divert the water we needed. And we'd use the biological lifeforms as our tools. We'd use furs for warmth, wood for fuel, oxen for labour.

However, we'd soon make tools ourselves. We'd make stone axes, wood spears, and buckets and soon we'd be progressing up to the Bronze Age, Steel Age, and so forth. So we'd be technologically evolving. One day we'd have no Bronze Age tools, and generations later, we would. And the process would repeat itself over and over as new technology was developed.

And that evolution would be a recurring story of barren landscapes, becoming populated by new tools in a land rush, and eventually those tools would form an ecosystem. But that ecosystem would be a barren landscape once new and better tools were created. So the process would start all over again.

Biologically humanity would stay the same. Personalities, talents, abilities, characters, curiosities. But socially, we'd have roles in the development and distribution of new tools.

So we'd have two identies. The natural biological person we are, and the societal role we're playing during the development of new tools. And thus we have two selves. One for the person we are, and another for the job we have. It's ruling philosophies that connect us to our jobs, while its majic that makes us keep our souls alive. The trick is to make the two meet. So, our jobs let us be who we really are, taking away the conflict of doing jobs we hate.

And that comes inside ecosystem. The point of this thought experiment was to showcase that humanity is always evolving our tools. But we do it the way biology does it. We have an ecosystem in place, but as soon as a new technology is created, our civilization is a barren island again, which must populate with new products. And we're forever trying to form ecosystems, places with members and non-members, so our two selves, our personalities and jobs, can co-exist.

This divide between a self-for others, and a master-slave arrangement. It's as simple as saying we all wish we were doing a job we loved. And that is when the rules of society, and the majic in our souls, are in alignment. And that happens when were a member of a community, free to live our lives because we have value.

## Thirty Years War

The story of evolving new tools, coming together into hierachies, only to fight for distribution, is a recurring story. That means it's ongoing right now. Also, since it's how we evolve tools, it will always be there as well.

So where are we in this story of civilization. Two different points.

The first is around the Thirty Years War (1618-1648), which was after King Charles, but before Rousseau. The extras were so sick of their political system. The hunger and scared peasants running away from Vikings begging to get behind the gates of castles of arrogant but actually dutiful kings were no more. Now it was pompeous kings sent from God, to host banquets and balls. So they revolted and Europe burned from 30 years in a war equal in size and terror to World War II.

But one big problem. The people hated their ruling philosophy, but didn't have a new one to express themselves. All they had was the divine rights of kings with two flavours. Protestant kings or Catholic kings. So extras pissed off at their ruling philosophy, blamed each other's beliefs when in reality it was the shared system they hated. The carnage was so bad, both sides agreed to leave each other alone, and 1648 is when political ecosystems officially started. The borders of each country were set, respected, and officially people inside were members, and people outside were not.

Still, the people weren't happy. The next century extras in both Protestant and Catholic kingdoms, rose up to shed themselves of kingdom and declare themselves protagonists in a democracy of equals we live in today.

Today we're in the same spot. The extras are pissed up. No longer the hungry and desperate masses that crowded the employment lines of the Industrial Revolution. And as we get more pissed off, we have two options of the same ruling philosophy, red or blue. Neither has any new answers so the only thing left is war.

If I went back in time to 1618 and could tell all those Germans, French, English, Swedes, extras how to avoid killing themselves over a old ruling philosophy, I'd tell them all exactly what I've told you. Because what I've told you are the lessons we've learned from their struggle. The modern extra/consumer, what anyone would tell a extra/peasant in 1610. You don't need to fight for the king, you have to fight for yourself.

And that would be cool and would make a good movie. A race against time to see if Neo could release the religious Europeans from their bondage before 30 years of war. But it still wouldn't work. Europe would still burn and so will we. Because regardless of what I could say, nobody would believe me, back in 1618 or now.

All i've done here is take the lessons our ancestors worked to hard to collect, and went back in time to tell you, the modern extra/consumer, what anyone would tell a extra/peasant in 1610. You don't need to fight for the king, you have to fight for yourself.

I didn't write this book to tell you what the past teaches us. I wrote it to tell you what the future is going to show you. Because that is something you'll get to see for yourself.

## Ask

Hi ya'll,

I could use a favour. I've spent some time writing a book and need some feedback. I've already finished it, but it's taking more time (it's why I’ve been kinda absent lately) to polish it than I thought it would. So, before I do anymore, I'd like to know if it's worth it.

It's about technology and politics, and how the middle-class can get a better deal when dealing with government and businesses. I worked hard to make it readable, I'm just not sure if it's good enough that people will actually read it.

The sample is about 25 pages, so if you're up for it, I'd appreciate some help. DM me and I'll send a link.

Cheers!

## Thirty Years War

## Read Now or Read Later

There's a heck of a lot of political emotions in today's Western Civilization. Conservative and Progressive are worldwide ideologies in disarray. Their believers march and scream just as much after elections as before them. I'd put our situation right before the Thirty Years War (1618-1648). A time when Catholicism and Protestantism spanned the globe, and their believers back at home were so discontent they fought against evil "Catholic" or "Protestant" kings.

What the people really wanted was a new political philosphy. But there's no mental switch. It was only after Europeans questioned their kings, that they realized their all kings were assholes. Soon the people demanded freedom inside their own countries and so they fought the American (1776) and French Revolutions (1789).

Why didn't they just fight the kings? For the same reason we just just pick up the keys to a space ship today. There's research and development involved for our philosophies. It involves living a life on the frontline, experiencing all it's the problems, using the tools that could solve them, and using reason to create a readable explanation for the new rules that should govern our lives. If that happened sooner Europe may have avoided a lot of bloodshed.

Right now, each person on the Main Street has a choice. It's not support Conservative or Progressive because these are just like picking a protestant or catholic king. I never meant to or wanted to write this book. It's not written as a political philosophy or history book. I could have but didn't want to. Instead it's written for everyone on Main Street to look up and realize your smartphone, augmented reality, 4k video camera aren't just toys. They're the start of the Digital Age.

We achieved great things in the Industrial Age. It wasn't perfect, but new tools in medicine, physics, sanitation, education, agriculture empowered us to fight disease, ignorance, and hunger. But we're not in the Industrial Age anymore. Using old philosophies to solve our problems makes as much sense as using theology did to our ancestors all those years ago. We need a new philosophy, one that inspires people to think of the big picture again.

Political philosophies start with books. It was a series of books that lead Medieveal commoners to believe and undestand how they could control their own socieities. Either this is the one, or another one is. But it's not two aged, old, and bygone political beliefs go down fighting and take us all with thems.

## Open-Source Paragraph

I'm not talking about an idealist, imaginary world envisioned from storybooks. The Digital Age has already started to form. We've already seen how worker-to-worker collaboration already exists. We're living in its midst. Wikipedia, YouTube, Quora, Stack Overflow, VS Code, Firefox, Wikipedia, Common Voice, USB Implementers Forum, GitHub, Andriod, LibreOffice, and Linux are only a few examples of the wonderful world of cooperation working today. It's called the open-source community because software and ideas are "openly shared" to help create new tools. Millions of people are already working and living inside a fundamentally new way of life that's responsible for our awesome online world. There's no reason more industries can't adopt this worker-to-worker collaboration mindset.

## Property Generation and Regulation Nulled by Digital Property

Conservatism says protecting personal property keeps society rich because everyone has incentive to create new property or keep what they have in good condition. Hence conservaties don't like things like taxes or regulation that intefere with their "I know what's best" mentality. Progressives think different property really belongs to the community that worked in the mines, factories, stories and so forth, so Progressives want to regulate property to be sure selfish people (conservaties) don't control it to keep themselves rich.
  
Neither of these idea apply digital property. Digital property doesn't spoil, so there's no reason to "own" it. And it's limitless, so there's no reason to "regulate" it. Yet property protection, and property regulation, are what both conservatives and progressives know how to do, and thus they have to find phantoms to fight.

## The Majic of the Internet - Because of Cyborgolgy, If We Use the Internet, We Automatically Fight For the Digital Age

The internet has many protagonists. Paul Baran is one of the big ones. Here’s why.

The internet is a network. There are many ways of sending data through a network. The simplest is how phone systems do it with a direct circuit link between two phones. A call’s connection only stops when someone hangs up.

Alexander Graham Bell invented "direct circuit links" in 1876 and put it into action when he co-founded the American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T) in 1885. For generations direct links was how all telecommunications worked. But when the Soviets tested a hydrogen bomb in 1955, Paul Baran took it upon himself to make a new tool to help prevent a nuclear holocaust.

Baran realized to prevent nuclear war, the world needed a communications network that would survive an atomic attack. Only robust and reliable communications would ease American and Soviet trigger fingers during tense times.

Baran worked alone after work. By 1960 he came up with the two ideas he needed. The first was that his network should have no hubs or organizations (like telephone’s have) to control the flow of information. Central hubs make systems vulnerable to attack or failure. Instead data flow should be completely distributed so every node can send and receive information equally. Baran’s nodes network looks like a fishnet. When each  node has three or four links, the network can survive any attack.

Next Baran had to figure out how to send information across the network. This led to his second idea, which was to break up the data into standard-size little packets. Each message would be broken into many packets, each of which would scurry along different paths through the network’s nodes and be reassembled when they got to their destination. If one packet didn’t get there in time, it was quickly resent. This way there’d be no "dropped calls" and communication would always stay open. Baran published his ideas into very detailed technical specs and made sure everyone, especially the Soviets, could copy his work.

Baran then walked into a nest of villains in America. When Baran’s employer RAND recommended his "node-packet data network" idea to the Air Force (in control of America’s nuclear missiles) they wanted to build it. But when the Department of Defense got itself and the Defense Communications Agency involved Baran soon found out working with so many bureaucrats was hopeless.

So Baran tried to convince AT&T, in control of America’s telephone network, to supplement their system with his node-packet data network. "They fought it tooth and nail," he recalled. "They tried all sorts of things to stop it". They would not even let RAND use the maps of its circuits, so Baran had to use a pirated set. He made several trips to AT&T headquarters in lower Manhattan. On one of them, a senior executive who was an old engineer looked stunned when Baran explained that his system would mean that data could go back and forth without a dedicated link remaining open. "He looked at his colleagues in the room while his eyeballs rolled up sending a signal of his utter disbelief," according to Baran. After a pause, the executive said, "Son, here’s how a telephone works," and explained a patronizing and simplistic description.

The metaphorical Death Star rule book became real! It was against the rules to make a reliable communication network that might help prevent a nuclear holocaust. Good thing Jedi’s don’t give up. Baran continued to push. AT&T finally had him and other outsiders to a series of seminars explaining how its telephone system really worked. "It took ninety-four separate speakers to describe the entire system," Baran marveled. When it was over, the AT&T executives asked Baran, "Now do you see why packet switching wouldn’t work?" To their great disappointment, Baran simply replied, "No".

To heck with Darth Telephone!

A decade later Baran’s network was built when the US government’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) saw the wisdom in a node-packet distributed communications network. In 1969 ARPA used Baran’s technical specs to build ARPAnet, the first version of the internet. The people who made it were hellbent on empowering individuals, and the made sure the internet could not be controlled by any government or corporation.

Baran’s network is why our smartphones, websites, Wikipedia, any digital tool connected to the internet empower individuals. In the DNA of the internet is a distributed node network that nobody can control or shutdown. An individual has the exact same access as any corporation or government.

That’s why the internet is majical. Whoever uses it, is automatically empowered.

_Paul Baran's story was adapted from Walter Isaacson's awesome book_ The Innovators, _Chapter 7._

## Summary

I'm going to cut this short.

Listen to me. When your cars breaks down, you call a mechanic for help, right? If he showed up with no tools, you’d get mad. You wouldn't ask his reasons for not bringing tools, nor would you discuss the weather with him. You needed "Mike the mechanic" to show up and solve your problem. Without the tools he's just "Mike the person", and frankly useless to you.

If there were no tools, you'd have to resort to regulations and campaigning to get people to help you. But with tools, all you need is the tools and a person who can use them. Tools are political problem solvers. Tools are political power.

Middle class people have a host of problems like increasing insurance, prescription drug, and tutoring bills. You need solutions. When someone says they can help, you must ask what tool they have, or will give you, that will help. Anything else is smoke and mirrors. You don’t need to see regulations, laws, or blog posts anymore then you need to see the mechanic’s favorite car repair manual. You need tools.

Red/blue philosophies show up with no tools. Not because red/blue leaders and supporters don’t care. But because their philosophies don’t know better. They're stuck inside an old ecosystem before the Digital Age. Thus they believe in a political ecosystem with members and non-members, but an economic island still trying to grow. But digital tools make economic ecosystems possible. But since our ruling philosophy is old, it's stuck on old tools, and thus they tell the middle class to walk to the nearest gas station and hope for help, and they promptly blame the opposing political party when we complain.

That’s not horrible, until you consider that with a new digital car, like a Tesla, our broken cars can now call the mechanic, give him a diagnostic to his smartphone immediately, and he’d be able to tell what the problem is, and most importantly, tell the scared person the side of the road, what to do next.

Now consider it’s often against the rules to solve our problems so simply. Patent laws, insurance regulations, nondisclosure agreements, non-compete clauses; a mountain of rules any antagonist can search through so he can force us to keep walking to gas stations.

We must realize how much new digital tools help. Here’s an exercise to do it. Every time you want to watch a Netflix show or YouTube video, get in your car, drive five miles, wait 10 minutes, throw away six bucks, drive back home, and then press play. Watch the movie, drive back within 24 hours or get charged a late fee. Easy to forget, but that’s what watching content on demand with videocassettes and DVDs was like.

Netflix was a big victory. But a rare one. Today, how we pay taxes, recognize education, repair electronics, transfer home ownership, decide our investments, sign sales contracts, get hired, fire someone, use warranties, access medical records, and so much more, works like how we rented a DVD. An unnecessary and expensive pain in the ass enforced by a Death Star of rules. It echoes the philosophy that preached to our ancestors that voting, reading science books, and owning a musket were all against the rules. Totally bullshit, and holding us all back from the land of equality, responsibilties, freedom, and accountability  we want to live in. And we will, once we think of politics as holding tools.

## The Problem With Not Having an Ending

So do you think Darth Blockbuster is dead? Do you think he'll ever die? Do you feel the weight of the questin on your shoulders, Stargazer. Do you feel it—the weight of the world? The mantle of fate? As we create a new philosophy to rule our society's deepest definitions of right and wrong in all areas from politics to economics?

You shouldn't. For this book was merely a lesson in the history of political philosophy. Which is history of sequels.

I didn't write this book to create a new ruling philosophy that we'll use to make a new rule book. Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, St. Augustine, Francis Bacon, John Locke, even my favorite Rousseau could't make a political philosophy that, when applied inside a rule book, was agreed upon by everyone.

Protagonists and antagonists still fought over tools, and the extras were stuck in between trying to figure out who the bad guys were. Most of political philosophy is basically new version of my "one good story, and two bad stories" explanation. The point is in the 2300 years of politcal philosophy we're still here aruging over if its okay for someone to download download a movie or not.

Regardless of the political philosophy, human frailty taints its application when writing the rulebook to govern everyday life. Power corrupts man, turning once classical heroes (and especially their descendants) into self-important "art" film characters who use their money to distract the masses with spectacle. When spectacle doesn't work they use their Death Star rule book to hold on for as long as possible.

Thus, I didn't write this so Techvolution will replace red/blue politics with its own rule book. Even though it would be an improvement, it wouldn't all that digital tools make possible. I only wrote this book to wipe old rule books away.

Because digital tools are the telescope showing us the Nature in a new light. One that finally let's us finally see the "visions of the just and good society" the philosophers dreamed about.

So come Stargazer, with your mind wipe clean up old philosophies, and human written rule books, we can now find true answers to the human condition as we tear the mask of Nature, and stare into the face of God.

## Quotes on Thirty Years War

“Though they are now largely silent, the voices from the seventeenth century still speak to us from the innumerable texts and images we are fortunate to possess. They offer a warning of the dangers of entrusting power to those who feel summoned by God to war, or feel that their sense of justice and order is the only one valid.”
― Peter H. Wilson, Europe's Tragedy: A New History of the Thirty Years War

“Protestant propaganda presented the Thirty Years War as a papal crusade, with the Jesuits as the pontiff’s storm troopers.”
― Peter H. Wilson, Europe's Tragedy: A New History of the Thirty Years War

## explaining philosophy

The political ideologies we have today—Conservative, Progressive, Socialist, Marxist—are just like the Athens Democracy, Roman Republic, and Divine Monarch. They are merely options we can choose from to our society. With every technological era, comes a new philosophy to (try) and get people to see the big picture, that everyone should be the player god. This is important to remember. Our politics changes with technological development.

## Technological History of the Movies - Using what weve learned

Assuming you tried, it's funny how easy it was to find Darth Blockbuster on YouTube. Now, I need to know how movies and television technologically evolved. This would take weeks at a library. But I have Wikipedia so it'll take a few hours. Rubbish indeed professors.

So let's go.

The first thing to understand, is movies didn't invent stories. We've always, and always will, tell stories. They help us understand our lives and societies. Religious sermons, epic poetry, and stage plays have filled our need of stories throughout the years.

The movies, and later television, are merely tools that help tell stories. Each is a creation of three pieces of technology. Data transmission, data storage, and data viewing. Movies started in 1894 when Thomas Edison’s laboratory invented the kinetoscope; the first machine that moved pictures through a light source fast enough to give the impression of seamless movement. Hence the name "moving pictures", simplified as "movies".

The kinetoscope was like a vending machine for movies. Customers looked through a peep hole to see clips of boxing matches or dance routines. It was a popular novelty, kind of like GIFs on Instagram. Edison owned the patents and created the New Jersey based Motion Picture Patent Corporation (MPPC) to make sure everyone in the young movie industry paid their dues.

After a few years of MPPC’s interference and legal threats, in what amounted to shakedowns, movie companies moved to Los Angeles to get away. As new projector technology came, MPPC lost its patent monopoly anyway. The movie industry was free to grow in LA’s good weather, cheap land, and no stifling East Coast corporate hierarchies.

And best yet technology kept improving. New projectors could show movies on huge screens. Although reels weren’t long enough yet to show long movies. With the new projectors, movie theaters called Nickelodeons (because admission cost a nickel) opened up across the country. The movies were still novelties, showing exotic animals, news reels, or sports highlights, but getting better, like Instagram stories, instead of GIFs.

By the 1920’s film reels were long enough to show three act stories. Although sound still wasn’t synched with film, so movies had subtitled dialogue and theatres used live music bands to communicate emotions.

In 1927 film was finally synchronized with sound, giving movies dialogue and music. For the first time in history, full stories were not limited to a physical theatre. Any movie theatre in the world could show any story. A new storytelling tool was thus created.

Like Instagram or Netflix popularity today, the people certainly felt the magic of good storytelling, and the majic of needing the theatre. No longer a novelty, the movies attracted millions every week. American industry rushed to control the booming industry. American culture was told on the silver screen. Leading actors became cultural icons. The industry exploded with profits. Although the people controlled none of it, their interest and loyalty made it happen one movie ticket at a time.

Of course, all the technology that made the movie industry so rich and powerful was physical. Data storage, transport, and viewing was physical film, light projectors, and delivery trucks.

This didn’t change until a new tool was born in 1948. Televisions used a different mixture of technologies. Huge magnetic tape reels stored content. Radio transmitted content over the airwaves. And televisions received the transmissions, and displayed the content on tube televisions.

Broadcasts television companies like NBC, ABC, and CBS, now competed with movie theatres. TV story quality wasn’t as good, but the convenience was huge; especially as Americans slowly moved away from the cities packed with movie theatres into the suburbs packed with TV’s.

From the 1950’s to the early 1980’s nothing much changed in the entertainment industry. Movies and television got better technologies. Film reels got clearer, color, and widescreen. Likewise, televisions got bigger and bandwidth improved with cable. But no new tools were created. The people still couldn’t choose or produce their own content.

Then came new tools. The magnetic tapes databases that stored TV broadcasters’ content, got small enough to make home video cassette recorder (VCR). VCR’s cut out the broadcaster, who of course sued the manufacturer Sony for letting people break the rules and "time shift" television shows. The case ended up in the Supreme Court in 1984.

In a 5-4 vote the power to record and watch videos was distributed to the people; the extras were free to add the VCR to their cyborgology. VCRs, home cameras, and renting movies became very popular in the late 1980’s. The most successful video rental company took the name "Blockbuster", the common term for popular movies. The entertainment industry quickly forgot about its VCR objections, and gladly put its content on Blockbuster’s busy shelves.

Home entertainment tools kept getting better. In the late 1990’s came DVD’s and flat screen televisions. DVD’s were more advanced CD’s, and worked like videotapes, except they were digital. Meaning data was stored as "1 or 0". Plasma or LCD flat screens televisions were much bigger than tube televisions, and since they were digital too, they were High Definition.

Even more people rushed to upgrade their cyborgology with DVD’s and home theatres. Blockbuster rental stores were even busier, especially as people started buying hundreds of DVD’s for home libraries. The entertainment industry loved it. They didn’t even care movie theatre attendance dropped heavily and many went bankrupt. In fact, they started to use theatres as marketing hype. The money was in DVD sales.

Yet they didn’t notice, that the data transmission, data storage, and data viewing technologies of the movie industry was now almost entirely digital.

Except movie distribution. People still had to drive to pick up their DVD’s or less likely visit a movie theatre. Hence, people still needed to concentrate around movie theatres, rental stores, or TV guides (i.e. the castles with gatekeepers), to access their digital data.

Until they didn’t.

The internet, the transfer of digital information that was used for email and webpages since the 1970’s, had kept getting better and faster. And in the early 2000’s the internet got High Speed, and could finally transfer 1’s and 0’s of a DVD faster then someone driving to pick one up.

And here enters The Pirate Bay (2003). Like Napster, it introduced digital movies to people first. Although the entertainment industry used digital cameras, film projectors, email, webpages, YouTube for years, they didn’t want people using a new tool, but to keep using their profitable DVD technology; they even made two new ones called Blu-Ray (2006) and HD-DVD (2006).

The people wanted the better tool. The one that made their life more profitable. After all the countless hours needed to invent new digital tools was mostly done on their tax dollars in government labs and military funding and university institutions. Pirate Bay was the first to offer the new technology as a new tool to the people. It was a pain, it was hard to learn, but it was better than driving.

Remember the industry called this people thieves! Customers are pirates! People are evil, people are cheap, people are thieves! Really? Then explain the graph below, the one what shows how the evil people responded with protagonist Reed Hastings in 2005 made a new internet tool and gave internet movies to the people. What we call Netflix, by 2009, when Hollywood was panicking about BitTorrents, the people were finally given internet streaming. This was the same fucking time as Darth Blockbuster and the industry was complaining about human evolution.

    </script>

If middle class Americans and Canadians are pirates, why didn’t Blockbuster stores have steel bars? The same reason why we don’t steal Netflix. Blockbuster was a fair deal, until data streaming movies was possible. Then Netflix was.

The people elected to download movies from pirate bay because it was an upgrade available to their cyborgology. The only natural rule is natural selection. When people choose the best tool, they evolve into better cyborgs. It’s not the people’s job to wait for an industry to catch up to Nature. It should be the other way around.

Maybe the industry would have noticed that. Instead, they were too busy surrounding themselves with art and wanted people to being distracted with spectacle (Blu-Ray, HD-DVD). While calling their own customer’s thieves, the movie industry held countless banquets and balls on the people’s DVD dollars; movie premieres, talk shows, award shows, and launch parties. Read books like Hollywood Interrupted and the revelation of the #MeToo movement, and these parties were, never mind self-congratulatory, but often even evil.

The industry became self-obessed artists patting themselves on the back for making every weirder films, while manufacturing cheap spectacle to distract the masses. The masks of royalty appeared again. Success wasn't defined by those on the frontline, but by politicking and ingratiating oneself to the putrid politics of a aged industry.

The Oscars, Correspondence Dinners, Emmy’s, Golden Globes, Cannes Film Festival, Sundance Film Festival, Toronto International Film Festival, and so many others. All modern version of banquets and balls, with gates to keep you out, and rules put in place to make the good times of the DVD going. Party loving, profit loving, foresight lacking is a recipe for antagonism, hence Darth Blockbuster rose up.

While the spectacle of Blu-Ray and HD-DVD tricked some extras, like with Wikipedia attracting people despite the supposed experts objections, the vast majority followed the natural majic of online movie streaming instead, even when it was against the rules to improve society.

Digital tools empowered the extras to fight back, and check his self-important art story. Nevermind that the people flocked to HBO and Netflix not only for the better technology and value, but because these companies emulated early Hollywood and told classic stories like _The Sopranoes_, _Breaking Bad_, and _Game of Thrones_. The people sought out these products.

In short, the movie industry was led by people who didn't know how to tell stories. They re-used past hits to squeeze as much out of the glory days as possible. Hence, so many movies were sequals and remakes that were simply bad stories.

The artists inside the industry got back at them with a system of "one for them, one for me" and made increasingly weired, unenjoyable, and politically charged art films.

Here's the frontline difference between spectacle/art, and classic stories.

If rying to make people shake in their seats by adding a motor isn't bullshit... So the people revolvted to new leaders. Heroes that used modern tools to do a good job and tell quality stories.

Techvolution tells them its right to do it. As for it being against the rules, it was, but the rules weren't updated to digital tools so who cares.

As for me. I was naive back then and never downloaded any movies. I was the sucker buying DVD’s.

Hey, do you think Darth Blockbuster will buy back all those DVDs, Blu-Rays, and HD-DVDs he told me, and us, was better than downloading? I wonder did those go up, or down, in value?

- The Computer Age was started by traitors. It's true. History calls them, with a grin of course, the Traitorous Eight. They were eight young kids, working for Shockley Semi-conductor in the 1950s. Shockley had helped invent the transistor and commercializing it. Sadly, he'd fallen into paranoia and made his workers miserable, They weren't happy because they knew they could change the world. So these eight unknown chemists, physicits, machinists, engineers, left Shockley and started their own company. It was still the Industrial Age, and hence these workers were supposed to be extras doing what they were told. Society yelled at them "this is a shameful act".

Who cares what the Sophia's of the world say today. These kids became protagonists of the Computer Age. These eight people are directly responsible for Intel, AMD, Kleiner Perkins, National Semiconductors, and many more companies. Indirectly, they seeded Silicon Valley with Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, and so on. Every Computer Age protagonist and player god today owes these eight people a debt of gratitude.

## ME MAJIC

And who am I to tell you all this? I'm nobody special. I haven't led the country, and you haven't seen me on the news. In my youth, I was a cleaner, laborer, movie usher, projectionist, and die-hard ideologue. After dropping the latter bad habit, I studied political philosophy, history, and innovation at the University of Toronto, usually while working full-time. I have a strong dislike for garbage meetings and other excuses people make-up to avoid work. I hate people with superiority complexes, especially when they're in positions of authority and suck at their jobs. That's why I learned far more about innovation by continuing working at the frontline as a line worker, an account manager, and a claims adjuster. Making a new tool and meeting my personal Darth Blockbuster was an education unto itself.

My life's experience began to teach me Techvolution. Watching the middle-class struggle to make a living owning, maintaining, and working with outdated Industrial Age tools—and knowing that the open-source community was meanwhile showing us the way to mass collaboration—ultimately motivated me to sit at the keyboard and uncover their collaboration philosophy so more people can live in the Computer Age. The middle-class deserves to be happy.

## Calling Dark Majic

Car commercials are everywhere. And they're a great example of old industries spicing up old tools. I've processed about 10,000 car accident insurance claims. When I'd ask about the caller's vehicle color, brand, etc. I'd usually get told stuff like "it's epic midnight silver with the special edition package." Sometimes I'd play stupid and have fun by asking, "are you sure it was epic morning silver?." To which people usually responded, "no, I'm quite sure it was the midnight."

The real funny part was when I'd ask, "what was the other guy driving?" and eight times out of 10, I'd hear, "you know what, I don't know." Not like they don't know the marketing color, they didn't know anything. They didn't know if it was an SUV or a pickup truck, a sedan, or a crossover, white or red. It was a pain in the ass because my job was to get this information. My customer simply couldn't remember. But when a person hit a horse, they'd remember it was a horse. But a car? None would stand out.

Many people buy cars and see themselves as being standouts. Yet what really sets a car apart is personal relationships. How easy was the buying experience. How well does your mechanic service it. Are you going to return to the dealership. Extras like more chrome or touch display, are important. But only to you. The truth is, you're the same cyborg with almost any car. Dark majic makes you overvalue frills. Majic values technology based on how much it empowers you with better reliability, fuel mileage, and re-sellability.

I know majic is better, because when someone's car was damaged after an accident, they wanted any car rental ASAP. Fancy features and made up colors didn't matter; they just needed to get around, and get on with their lives.

_This is dark majic. A player god of the Computer Age has to learn to filter this bullshit out._


### Technological History of the Movies

It's funny how easy it was to find Darth Blockbuster on YouTube. Now, I need to know how movies and television technologically evolved. This would take weeks at a library. But I have Wikipedia so it'll take a few hours. Rubbish indeed professors.

So let's free Obi-Wan.

The first thing to understand, is movies didn't invent stories. We've always, and always will, tell stories. They help us understand our lives and societies. Religious sermons, epic poetry, and stage plays have filled our need of stories throughout the years.

The movies, and later television, are merely tools that help tell stories. Each is a creation of three pieces of technology. Data transmission, data storage, and data viewing. Movies started in 1894 when Thomas Edison's laboratory invented the kinetoscope; the first machine that moved pictures through a light source fast enough to give the impression of seamless movement. Hence the name "moving pictures", simplified as "movies".

The kinetoscope was like a vending machine for movies. Customers looked through a peep hole to see clips of boxing matches or dance routines. It was a popular noveltly, kinda like GIFs on Instagram. Edison owned the patents and created the New Jersey based Motion Picture Patent Corporation (MPPC) to make sure everyone in the young movie industry paid their dues.

After a few years of MPPC's interference and legal threats, in what amounted to shakedowns, movie companies moved to Los Angeles to get away. As new projector technology came, MPPC lost its patent monopoly anyway. The movie industry was free to grow in LA's good weather, cheap land, and no stiffling East Coast corporate hierarchies.

And best yet technology kept improving. New projectors could show movies on huge screens. Although reels weren't long enough yet to show long movies. With the new projectors, movie theaters called Nickelodeons (because admission cost a nickel) opened up across the country. The movies were still novelties, showing exotic animals, news reels, or sports highlights, but getting better, like Instagram stories, instead of GIFs.

By the 1920's film reels were long enough to show three act stories. Although sound still wasn't synched with film, so movies had subtitled dialogue and theatres used live music bands to communicate emotions.

In 1927 film was finally synchronized with sound, giving movies dialogue and music. For the first time in history, full stories were not limited to a physical theatre. Any movie theatre in the world could show any story. A new storytelling tool was thus created.

Like Instagram or Netflix popularity today, the people certainly felt the magic of good storytelling, and the majic of needing the theatre. No longer a novelty, the movies attracted millions every week. American industry rushed to control the booming industry. American culture was told on the silver screen. Leading actors became cultural icons. The industry exploded with profits. Although the people controlled none of it, their interest and loyalty made it happen one movie ticket at a time

Of course, all the technology that made the movie industry so rich and powerful was physical. Data storage, transport, and viewing was physical film, light projectors, and delivery trucks.

This didn't change until a new tool was born in 1948. Televisions used a different mixture of technologies. Huge magnetic tape reels stored content. Radio transmitted content over the airwaves. And televisions recieved the transmissions, and displayed the content on tube televisions.

Broadcasts television companies like NBC, ABC, and CBS, now competed with movie theatres. TV story quality wasn't as good, but the convenience was huge; especially as Americans slowly moved away from the cities packed with movie theatres into the suburbs packed with TV's.

From the 1950's to the early 1980's nothing much changed in the entertainment industry. Movies and television got better technologies. Film reels got clearer, color, and widescreen. Likewise, televisions got bigger and bandwidth improved with cable. But no new tools were created. The people still couldn't choose or produce their own content.

Then came new tools. The magentic tapes databases that stored TV broadcasters content, got small enough to make home video cassette recorder (VCR). VCR's cut out the broadcaster, who of course sued the manufacturer Sony for letting people break the rules and "time shift" television shows. The case ended up in the Supreme Court in 1984.

In a 5-4 vote the power to record and watch videos was distributed to the people; the extras were free to add the VCR to their cyborgology. VCRs, home cameras, and renting movies became very popular in the late 1980's. The most successful video rental company took the name "Blockbuster", the common term for popular movies. The entertainment industry quickly forgot about its VCR objections, and gladly put its content on Blockbuster's busy shelves.

Home entertainment tools kept getting better. In the late 1990's came DVD's and flatscreen televisions. DVD's were more advanced CD's, and worked similar to videotapes, except they were digital. Meaning data was stored as "1 or 0". Plasma or LCD flatscreens televisions were much bigger then tube televisions, and since they were digital too, they were High Definition.

Even more people rushed to upgrade their cyborgology with DVD's and home theatres. Blockbuster rental stores were even busier, especially as people started buying hundreds of DVD's for home libraries. The entertainment industry loved it. They didn't even care movie theatre attendence dropped heavily and many went banktrupt. In fact, they started to use theatres as marketing hype. The money was in DVD sales.

Yet they didn't notice, that the data transmission, data storage, and data viewing technologies of the movie industry was now almost entirely digital.

Except movie distribution. People still had to drive to pick up their DVD's or visit a movie theatre. Hence, people still needed to concentrate around movie theatres, rental stores, or TV guides (i.e. the castles with gatekeepers), to acccess their digital data.

Until they didn't.

The internet, the transfer of digital information that was used for email and webpages since the 1970's, had kept getting better and faster. And in the early 2000's the internet got High Speed, and could finally transfer 1's and 0's of a DVD faster then someone driving to pick one up.

And here enters The Pirate Bay (2003). Like Napster, it introduced digital movies to people first. Altough the entertainment industry used digital camera's, film projectors, email, webpages, YouTube for years, they didn't want people using a new tool, but to keep using their profitable DVD technology; they even made two new ones called Blu-Ray (2006) and HD-DVD (2006).

The people wanted the better tool. Pirate Bay was the first to offer it. It was a pain, it was hard to learn, but it was better than driving.

Pirates you might say! People are evil, people are cheap, people are thieves! Really? Then explain the graph below, the one what shows how the evil people responded with protagonist Reed Hastings made a new internet tool and gave internet movies to the people. What we call Netflix.

If middle class Americans, Canadians are pirates, why didn't Blockbuster stores have steal bars? The same reason why we don't steal Netflix. Blockbuster was a fair deal, until data streaming movies was possible. Then Netflix was.

The people elected to download movies from pirate bay because it was a upgrade available to their cyborgology. The only natural rule is natural selection. The people choose the best tool because with majic, they evole into better cyborgs. It's not the people's job to wait for an industry to catch up to nature. But the other way around.

Maybe the industry would have noticed that. But they surrounded themselves with art and wanted people to being distracted with spectacle (Blu-Ray, HD-DVD). While calling their own customer's thieves, the movie industrt held countless banquets and balls on the people's DVD dollars; movie premieres, talk shows, award shows, and launch parties. The Oscars, Correspondence Dinners, Emmy's, Golden Globes, Cannes Film Festival, Sundance Film Festival, Toronto International Film Festival, and so many others. All modern version of banquets and balls, with gates to keep you out, and rules put in place to make the good times of the DVD going. Party loving, profit loving, foresight lacking is a recipe for antagonism, hence Darth Blockbuster rose up.

While the spectacle of Blu-Ray and HD-DVD tricked some people. Like with Wikipedia, the vast majority followed the natural majic of online movie streaming instead, even when it was against the rules to improve society.

Digital tools empowered the extras to fight back, and check his self-important art story. Techvolution tells them its right to do it. As for it being against the rules, it was, and maybe it should be, I was naive back then and only ever downloaded a few movies. I was the smuck buying DVD's. Hey, do you think Darth Blockbuster will buy back all those DVDs, Blu-Rays, and HD-DVDs he told me, and us, was better then downloading? I'll take half-price.

It was protagonists who gave the people internet streaming. Called movie pirates by the industry, these unpaid programmers on bitorrents did the work to save the people from billions of miles driven, late fees, and basements full of DVDs.

Thieves you might be thinking. They broke the rules. No. Rules are supposed to facilitate civilization upgrades. The movie industry's rules were the Death Star—the fictious prop that once saved the movies, was now killing it in reality. Because when another protagonist, Reed Hastings, started Netflix. This happened.

    </script>

Of course not. That didn't happen. The industry was controlled by Industrial Age businessman. And here is the birth of Darth Blockbuster. Because instead of embracing civilization, they turned on it and became comitted antagonists. The wanted, needed, no... demanded the Industrial Age never end. The twats addicted to remakes, even remade the DVD. Twice. But the HD-DVD and Blu-Ray both bombed.

And then it happened. The people were empowered. Because wouldn't you know it, the march of technology didn't stop. The internet, around since 1969, got high speed for Main Street. Like iTunes had already shown them was possible, the movie industry jumped at the opportunity to give their customers a better product at a cheaper price. Finally, the American public could watch their stories on demand through the internet. Storytelling entered the Computer Age.

## The End

Donald Trump is the savior of Western Civilization. Not because of his policies. Not because he makes you happy or angry. Some are good and some are bad. He's correct America sold itself since the 1970s. He's right to favour American manufacturing. He's wrong to mock climate change. He should use climate change as a way to modernize American manufacturing and lifestyle and make each much more self-sufficient. He's wrong to be vicious in his attacks against the Industrial Age media. He should ignore them completely and engage with Main Street directly. But none of that, or anything else, actually matters.

## First World Problems

"First world problems" is a funny way of saying we indulge our pettiness. But we do have problems, the biggest is taking our first world civilization for granted.

## Intermission

Enter Darth Blockbuster. He wants to keep us using his mass-produced tools. When dark majic fails, he uses society's rulebook to keep the Internet Age far far away. Thus even when player gods choose to buy solar-power roofs, start a 3D printing business in the garge, install a Hydroloop water resuser, today's rulebook often gets in the way. Do you now if your home insurance policy covers hail damage to newly installed solar panels? Do you even know where to find out if it does? What are your local tree by-laws, construction codes, tax laws? Do you live under threat of making a mistake, and being hit by a code violation, lawsuit, or audit?

Enter politics. Red/blue philosophies can't help you. They're bent on promoting the mass production of the Industrial Age. Thus, while you're fighting your insurance adjuster to pay for your hail damaged solar roof, they're telling you to fight phantom communists and fascists. You can fight back with Techvolution, the new philosophy that unifies the frontline to fight for the ability to make good decisions without any middleman saying otherwise.

Thereby, Techvolution will usher in the era of mass-collaboration. 

## Techvolution and The Lifestar

Usually, you'd be free to say Techvolution didn't click and so leave me alone because I'm going back to my life and none of this player god nosense is my problem. Historically, in politics, our judges are ourselves and we can bullshit ourselves out of healthy eating, self-reflection, and definitely all the attention it takes to be a player god.

But in the future, the near future, our judge won't be ourselves or the philosophy that clicks. No. It will be Nature. And Mother Nature doesn't take bullshit.

Soon Evolution will be your rulebook. No middleman. No subsidies. No dark majic. No Death Star. No Darth Blockbuster. Would you be a player god, if the only person judging you, was the same person that judges oak trees, cheetahs, and polar bears? You would be, or Evolution will get rid of you.

And welcome to the Life Star. A rulebook based on Techvolution, governed by human technological adaption and natural selection that makes sure humanity never stalls when upgrading to the next technological age. It's better if Techvolution clicks now, but even if it doesn't, its rulebook coming, and I guarantee you, Techvolution will click in the future. Here's the reason why.

Adjusting sucks. Our only tools were a telephone, email, voicemail, checkbook, google, and a supervisor telling us to hurry up or get fired. Beyond st-st-stress ~~stressful~~, very emotionally taxing.

Until you speak with a driver who is a real person. Real person because their accident was a life changing horror. Maybe their arm was amputated, or their friend was ejected from the car, or their kid burned alive twelve hours ago.

You’re mind shuts up Darth Call Centre the moment you talk to this real person. They have a problem and your soul wants to help.

Why did this happen? That’s all drivers want to know. Was someone trying to beat a red light? Was the road not salted for ice. Was it drunk driving? What’s the reason for the sudden terror of pain? It’s soothes people to know why the accident happened; it helps knowing it won’t happen again.

## Mixed Philosophical Politics

Let me explain how Techvolution can be our ruling philosophy by discussing evolution in martial arts.

Humanity has many martial arts: karate, kickboxing, wrestling, jiu-jitsu, judo, and boxing being among the most popular. Each martial art adapts the human body to do specific techniques like punches or choke-holds. Each martial art also makes rules, so only their chosen methods are allowed during competition; there's no kicking in a boxing match, for example.

In the early 1990s, the martial arts community got curious and wondered whose martial art would win a real fight. On reflection, it seems funny that this was an original idea. But before the 1990s, people just assumed boxers or wrestlers could not fight outside their rulebook. All fighters were supposed to be ideologically loyal and sing to their choirs about their techniques being the best. If a fighter got their ass kicked in a real fight, they'd often blame themselves or say the other guy "broke the rules" and "cheated."

The martial art community evolved. They held "no rules" tournaments and were fittingly rewarded with Nature's officially best martial art. The best martial art was none of them; or all of them. Meaning, the best fighters trained all techniques and used the ones they thought would defeat their opponent based on the exact moment they were fighting them. A large toolbox of techniques and an open mind to adapt proved to be the best martial art. Fighters soon embraced adaption and natural selection.

This was the start of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA). A new sport that cherishes the evolution mantra "admit defeat and learn." And while boxers still punch the best, and kickboxers kick the best, evolution empowered MMA fighters will almost always win in a street fight.

Red/blue ideologies are like non-MMA martial arts. They teach a limited number of techniques, limit themselves to their own rulebook, and often think "the other side" is ignorant. Ideologues even accuse non-believers of cheating after losing a vote or election. However, in their area of expertise red/blue have a massive reservoir of know-how. The ideals and openness of Progressivism helps bring new peoples into Western culture, while giving a leg up to those already inside. The practicality and steady hand of Conservatives helps insure our society keeps working. Moreover, each side has immense knowledge on monetary policy, farm regulation, labor relations. This single book can't replace all that knowledge. It would be laughable to suggest it could.

But we still need a new ruling philosophy. One created from the lessons of evolution and digital tools old philosophies could not factor in. Hence why this book is about making human technological evolution, Techvolution, the most protected political right and responsibility today. There's no other way to enter into the Internet Age.

You can think of Techvolution as "mixed philosophy politics." Under Techvolution, a player god is encouraged to study and believe in old philosophies. Ideals like equality, liberty, equity, family values, social justice, are all still valid if they motivate you to improve civilization. But no one should let the rule books of old philosophies determine right and wrong when up against a person's right to evolve on the frontline. Like voting our interests in elections, we the people on the frontline today—the people in the real fight—need the freedom to decide which tool best solves a problem. The right and duty to evolve must trump all other considerations.


I made a new tool that would have helped. Not solved. Not actual magic, but it majically would have gotten us closer to solving car accidents. But Darth got in the way. He’ll never say that, or even know it. He thinks frontline pain is a thing to stand above, not ever feel and solve with new tools. Darth is nothing if not detached. He is the epitome of apathy in the face of others’ pain. Self-declared main characters think extras are expendable.

## Thomas Paine

===

  >SINCE the time that learning began to flourish there has been a common opinion maintained which affirms: "Mankind is naturally endowed and born with freedom, and at liberty to choose what form of government it please, and that the power which any one man has over others was at first bestowed according to the discretion of the people."

  But how this vulgar opinion has of late obtained a great reputation is unknown to me. It is not to be found in the ancient fathers and doctors of the true Church. It contradicts the doctrine and history of the Holy Scriptures, the practice of all ancient monarchies, and the very principles of the law of nature. It is hard to say whether it is more erroneous in divinity or dangerous in policy.

  This desperate assertion whereby kings are made subject to the judgements and deprivations of their subjects follows as a necessary consequence of foolhardy position of the supposed natural equality and freedom of mankind, and liberty to choose what form of government it please.

## Synthesis

Just to drive home the point some more. Anybody can use modern technology to fight for a cause. So what do Left/Right ideologies make? Do Conservatives empower you to fight against government waste, tax-hikes, or over regulation with a website? Do Progressives let you contribute to better environmental regulation, health-reform, or track real-time carbon levels? What levers of power does Right/Left politics put in your hand?

The idea doesn't even exist, because they think its 1969, when the levers of power weren't available to Main Street. Ideologues (if they're still reading) are right now trying to figure how to discount this point. I promise, some Conservatives look at Common Voice and see "common" and will yell out they found Communism in America! A Progressive looks at Kickstarter raising money for something, and will scream "see, the rich are getting richer!". Knee-jerk reactions like this are expected from people born and raised with red/blue filters.

Neither can understand the Internet Age and mass-collaboration is the best of both ideologies. Modern technology let's people help their civilization prosper, as Progressives dream, and also better themselves, as Conservatives demand. Mixing ideologies is how Techvolution builds on the past, and helps Main Street prosper once again. Now let's see what this means for regular person working on Main Street.

## Baran

When Baran tried to give his specs away, he walked into a nest of antagonists. The Department of Defense was a sea of very unhelpful bureaucrats. So Baran tried to convince AT&T, in control of America's telephone network, to supplement their system with his node-packet data network. "They fought it tooth and nail," he recalled. "They tried all sorts of things to stop it." One engineer "eyeballs rolled up, sending a signal of his utter disbelief" at Baran's ideas.

Good thing Jedi's don't give up. Baran continued to push. AT&T finally had him and other outsiders to a series of seminars explaining how its telephone system worked. "It took ninety-four separate speakers to describe the entire system," Baran marveled. When it was over, the AT&T executives asked Baran, "Now do you see why packet switching wouldn't work?" To their great disappointment, Baran simply replied, "No."

To heck with Darth Telephone!

The point is this. Baran's network was eventually built the US government's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) saw the wisdom upgrading America's communication system. In 1969 ARPA used Baran's technical specs to build ARPAnet, the first version of the internet. Although it's grown bigger and faster, the internet is still technically unchanged. That's why within the DNA of the internet we use everyday, is your freedom.

Extra: How about we fly to Washington D.C. Walk in a huge crowd of people, and yell into the air while holding signs up, and maybe we'll get on CNN.
Player: This isn't the WWE.

Extra: Climate change isn't even real. It's a Left-Wing conspiracy.
Player: Welcome the other side of the coin. Okay, screw the scientists. What's wrong with harvesting American energy.
Extra: Then let's us drill baby!
Player: Long-term, think beyond. Electrifying our economy. Tesla.
Extra: Hippie! I want the rumble of the engine asshole. That's a man rumble!
Player: Now that's dark majic; you communist!
Extra: Me a communist?! I watch Fox News asshole!
Player: The place where the brag about exporting American manufacturing—the factories and workforce that built made America great in the Industrial Age—and sent it all to China, a communist country. Thumbs up. Just so they could be what? What skillset do those people have?
Extra: They're experts.
Player: If Noah's Ark happens again, none of them would get a seat. If we had to evacuate Earth, none of them would get the pick. As we're planning to colonize Mars, none of those people are getting the call-up.

Player: In the 1970s, 80s, and 90s, the Industrial Age was over, our resource count was dropping. The people in charge didn't know what to do. So they started selling stuff like a yard sale. Leftists wanted to regulate, Rightists wanted an easy buck.
Extra: They had good reasons.

Player: Even kids who play a computer game know, if you don't have factories, technicians, craftsmen, engineers—but are full of marketers, lawyers, and HR reps, what you have is a Civilization on its last legs. Tesla was always going to succeed. Because they started small, attracted talent, and a mission. Upgrade civilization to the Internet Age. We have to keep doing that.

Extra: But I like the rumble of V8 power.
Player: Do play Anno 1800, Starcraft, or anything based on likes, or requirements. Well then shut the fuck up. Think about your kids.
Extra: I don't want children.
Player: What about your cyborg kids.
Extra: Huh?
Player: We're cyborgs. Our DNA doesn't just live on with our biological kids. It lives on in the cyborgs we create today, who will be picked up by other people, and evolve....

## Lever of Power

First off a lesson about the industry. Insurance is nothing but a bank account. We deposit money to use later. But instead of withdrawing it to buy something, we withdraw money after an accident, usually a crash. Thus, when a crash happens, you've activated the withdrawal and are immediately owed your money. The claim is all paperwork to confirm what's already happened.

And that's the problem. How do you access your money? With a lever you don't control. When I tried to democratize—ever so slightly—that lever of power, I got to see the Industrial Age fighting to keep it's sweetspot alive. Because while customers pay insurance with direct electronic payments on time, slowing the payments out, is good business.

Why do you think this is? Because a call-centre is a lever of power. And the pain of its long hold times, and never ending DINGS, is controlled by people who never hear them. I don't know what the stat is, but I'd guess for every adjuster collaborating with drivers to process their claim checks, there's 20 administrators, HR reps, marketers, managers, and executives taking money from the pot for themselves.

So what do you think is going to happen? After reading Techvolution, you should know, if a person doesn't hold a lever of power, they're disregarded. Because they're on the frontline, adjusters are powerless. Turnover is constant.

Drivers  have no power. Although they've paid tens of thousands in insurance every year. But, they're dependent on the copmany to give their money back. Without power, they're left waiting on hold. Just like the guy in Smitereens.

Industrial Age antagonists like standing above the frontline. Adjusters and drivers alike. Thus Main Street should stop being extras, and reach for the levers of power, and become player gods.

## The Appendices

If you stepped up, and decided to play the game, here's what you need to know about our world today. The player god is already forming against the Industrial Age powers. But it doesn't have a new philosophy to properly guide it. Like those Christian Puritans who dethroned Charles, our current political movements are extreme believers in the current ruling philosophy.

Think of today, if someone were to tell you how to vote, while looking over your shoulder, you'd be weirded out. If the criminal didn't leave, you'd call the police and society would rush to defend you. We all agree nobody should tell you, nor force you, how to vote. You yourself haven't done anything to earn that right. It's something our Rousseau inspired player god ancestors earned for us.

## Polar Bears in the Amazon

- Pick up and hold your blender, chef knife, or watch. You're holding your cyborgolgy; an extension of your biological tools. You're notice several marking on your item: trademark, copyright, patent, privacy policy, terms of service, and made in.

Ancient pottery doesn't have these markings; except Made in. The rest have their start in the Industrial Age as rules to promote the creation of more and more tools. And it's these markings that largely define our rulebook today. Our Antagonists don't want us to drop their Industrial Age tools, for Internet Age ones. They use their control of these markings to prevent it.

We've been in the Internet Age since 1970. However, we're still using the philosophy of Left/Right politics, and era of mass-production economics, both hallmarks of the Industrial Age. The powers of the Industrial Age, keep their tools as the levers of power by way of dark majic, and when that fails, they use rules from the Death Star to prevent change.

The Death Star is the list of government, legal, and corporate rules. Most were started early in the Industrial Age, intended to help civilization prosper as we started up the first machines of industry. And these rules did their job. But for us today, that means we have anti-trust, copyright, labour, and many other laws, regulations, guidelines based in a time when carrier pigeons still existed. It's funny to think about, but it's also very true.

When the Internet Age came, society was technicially transforming bit by bit. Without a new philosophy, our politics was managing the computerization of our civilization, with rules of meant for industrialization. Hence, why starting in 1970 there was huge explosion of government regulations, trademarks, copyrights, and patents. And think of this, lobbyists didn't exist in 1969—and now many people think a few thousand of them run our governments.

Because Industrial Age powers want to hold back our evolution to keep the Industrial Age alive for as long as possible. That's why they exported American industry, hyped up

We're basically polar bears in the Amazon. Seriously, think of it—our environment is different, our societies are different, and our cyborgology is different. We are a different people being forced to live as if it were 1969. There's nothing wrong with polar bears, or the Amazon, but neither is adapted for each other. Same goes for a person in 2020—who owns a laptop, hi-speed internet, VR glasses—but is driving through two hours of traffic, to work at a call-centre.

If you would see adaptions like a camel's water retaining hump near the Great Lakes, or a eagle eyes inside a cave system, you'd stop and wonder; "why are these biologies here?". When you likewise see out of place cyborgologies like textbooks, fax machines, and paper-checks in our societies, you should now know something is wrong. Likely it's that Darth Blockbuster stopped our evolution, to keep his cyborgologies in power.

PICTURE

Techvolution is the new philosophy that mimics evolution. It gives the right, and the duty, to the people feeling the pain of frontline life to evolve humanity with new and better tools. Crucially, it's the open-source community who lets the public build its own levers of power, so we don't have to wait for persmission to do what's right.

Only by embracing Techvolution will our society foster the era of mass-collaboration and catapult ouselves all into the Internet Age. Only a society of players gods can evolve humanity past our problems, and give Main Street a happy life. Hopefully we can move fast enough to celebrate saving the polar bears.

_You're happiness is the best statistic about our civlization's health. But here are some stats to show our stagnation._

## Made In America

Pick up and hold your blender, chef knife, or shoes. You're holding your cyborgolgy; an extension of your biological tools. You're notice several marking on your item: trademark, copyright, patent, privacy policy, terms of service, and made in. Except Made In, Roman or Greek pottery doesn't have these markings. They started in the Industrial Age, meant to promote the creation of more and more property. And their stamping on our tools today, showcases Main Streets battle to reach the Internet Age.

Each marking signifies control over that item. So while you bought it, in some manner someone else controls it. But why does a blender need a trademark? A book, need a 90 year copyright, a paper-clip need a patent? Maybe, I don't know about that specific item. But the lawsuits they allow certainly get many antagonists paid.

What you should really be asking is why each marking is written by an American, but the Made In has since 1970 increasingly not said "Made In America". While there is a mountaing of economic theory to rationalize exporting American factories, design houses, industry, I find it funny how trademarkets, patents, and copyrights, were never exported. It's because Made In is the one marking Main Street controlled, and thus the one marking exported as soon as we hit the Internet Age.

## Made In America

Pick up and hold your blender, chef knife, or shoes. You're holding your cyborgolgy; an extension of your biological tools. You're notice several marking on your item: trademark, copyright, patent, and made in. Each marking signifies control over that item. So while you bought it, in some manner someone else controls it.

Now, since 1970, Made In has increasingly not said "America" at the end of it. What that means today is patent lawers are getting well paid. Copyright owners are getting well paid. Marketer coming up with another boring trademark name, are getting well paid. But the welders, craftsman, technicians who actually make stuff, are not. If the endless pages of economic theory that justified exporting American industry to encourage Main Street prosperity, why is Made In, the only marking today that's not done by an American?

Because exporting American industry was about keeping Main Street away from our tools, so we wouldn't do the rational thing, and starting updating our tools to the Internet Age.

## Cognitive Dissonance

Ruling philosophies are very powerful. With their high ideals, they make strong believers of people, who often have a hard time applying their philosophy to new developments in human knowledge. One example is Lysenkoism. This was a pseudo-science in the Soviet Union that assumed our genes inherit learned traits. So if you lived in a hot climate, your genes would morph to sweat more.

Darwin said our genes are set in stone, and it's the fittest who survive. Soviets didn't want to believe that though, because it sounded like elitism, which their communist ideology said was unnatural. The result was Soviet agriculture didn't get better seeds, genetic research was suppresed, and thousands of Soviet biologists were sent to labour camps. All to protect the ruling philosophy.

The further we go into the Internet Age, the more Progressive and Conservative ideologies get more out of date. You can already see them protecting their ideologies via phantom chasing for racists and socialists behind every corner. Fat-shaming, trigger words, death taxes, Some people will go to extremes against others to protect their own identities. Watch out.

## The End1

Our unhappiness is a fire alarm. Left and Right will take us down as they fight to stay alive in the Internet Age. To reverse our fortunes, we must upgrade to the Internet Age ourselves, and embrace the era of mass-collaboration. To do that, we need Techvolution, a new philosophy that gives the right, and duty, to frontline people to use digital tools to solve their real-life problems.

## Ideological Filters Are Deadly

Ruling philosophies are very powerful. They make strong believers of people, who often have a hard time applying an abstract philosophy to a changing world. One example is Lysenkoism. This was a pseudo-science in the Soviet Union that assumed genetics can learn traits. So if you lived in a hot climate, your genes would morph to sweat more.

Charles Darwin said our genes are set in stone, and it's the fittest who survive. Soviets didn't want to believe that because it sounded like elitism, which their communist ideology said was unnatural. The result was genetic research in the Soviet Union was so filtered by the heirarchy, it was useless.

On the frontline it meant farmers didn't get better seeds, genetic therapy didn't exist, and thousands of Soviet biologists were sent to labour camps for asking honest questions. All to protect the ruling philosophy.

The further we go into the Internet Age, the more Progressive and Conservative ideologies get out of date. You can already see them protecting their ideologies via phantom chasing for racists and socialists, trigger words, gay preachers, war on drugs, green new deals, Some people will go to extremes to protect their ideological filters. All the more reason to make sure the ruling philosophy is adapted to the modern technological age.

## Epilogue

What the Internet Age allows for the first time, is what Galileo did all those years ago when he said; "we don't know until we test, so let's use instruments to test what we think we know."

Using instruments to find the truth, means the truth no longer comes from leaders opinions. This is what Industrial Age antagonists fear most of all. Because the Internet Age, lets us track and measure frontline pain, making it the definition of right and wrong. And in summary, this is the Life Star.

You can see it already budding today. One example is the Twitter feed below. It's run by the Ontario Police to tell the public about car crashes.

<a class="twitter-timeline" data-width="600" data-height="500" data-theme="light" href="https://twitter.com/OPP_GTATraffic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">Tweets by OPP_GTATraffic</a> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Notice, I have no control over this Twitter feed. I can't make up the information. Nor can I gatekeep it from you. These are simply objective facts in our society, that because of the internet, anyone can see, feel, and collaborate around. Crucially, and painfully, the people in these crashes are in some level, living through Smithereens. Solving their pain with modern tools is Techvolution. Tracking and measuring their pain, is the Life Star.

_This is what modern technology is good for. Player gods demand this kind of life saving power._


That's of course bullshit. And the Internet Age gives us the ability to prove it.

At it's heart, Smithereens is a story about an extra. The tortured man assumes the company Smithereen will care about his problem. Extras assume "they" have the people's best interest at heart. "They" in government bureaucracy. "They" in corporations. "They" someone else. "They" only have your interest at heart if you hold the levers of power, because "they" is the player god. You're either a member, or you're not.

I wept while watching Smithereens; full out tears. I knew what the plot twist was—that a loved one died in a car crash—because I'd spoken with this person too many times. It was actually the motivation for me to make my app. I wanted to showcase how the Internet Age will help us solve things like horrible, useless, and preventable car crashes with something (I now call) the Life Star. What I ended up learning, is before we get to the future, we have to defeat the antagonists with an army of player gods believing in Techvolution, and wielding the levers of power inside the era of mass-collaboration.

Antagonists stepped on my app with bullshit reasons and excuses. They didn’t care about the future of technology, and didn't know one thing about their own industry. Not one. Car accidents are as mysterious to them as how to take out the trash. Their self-entitlement, blank faces, clueless looks, arrogant smirks was like talking to Charles, or Louis.


I never intended to write this book. I wrote a similar one, "Why the 2008 Economic Crisis Was Only the Beginning" years ago (although I never showed anyone). All the points from here are there—but it's not written quite as well.

I wanted (and am), writing "Building the Life Star" and "Starting Starfleet." Which in summary say, digital tools will start enabling mass-collaboration, give us objective facts whose lives and civilizations are more efficient, and therefore let us start saving oddles of money. With all the savings, we'll start the Space Exploration Age.

So I made my app to demonstrate these simple facts. Using modern web development, it took just a few months of work. Take some free code from GitHub, an inexpensive cloud computing account, and the design skills of a novice. It was simple. Might not even get me a job in "tech."

## Protagonists Wanted

Tesla isn't a company, it's the manifestation of the general will of so many people to get on with the Internet Age. Same with places like SpaceX, Linux Foundation, OpenAI. Like movie audiences looking for good stories, everyday people on Main Street are looking for companies and protagonists to believe in.

They public is always hiring protagonists to follow. Keep that in mind when hearing antagonists overhype another franchise movie, or blame insurance fraud for their problems. Maybe they're just aren't up to the job of being a leader.

## I Want to Work at Blockbuster, I Want to Use Netflix

Everyone knows the world is changing. We hear a lot of the computerization of work, the growth of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and the end of the "one job for life" mentality. What doesn't exist is a self-realization that _your_ job is changing. There are still lots of Blockbusters in the world today, and the people inside often think they'll work there forever even though they watch Netflix every night.

While I want Techvolution to help change our future, one thing I really hope it does, it make Main Street aware, they can't get away with thinking the future isn't coming. Eventually, society gets just as sick paying for your Blockbuster, as it did the original one.

But there's a roadblock; do you know if your home insurance policy covers hail damage to newly installed solar panels? Do you even know where to find out if it does? Do you know where to find your local business by-laws, building codes, tax laws?

Even without antagonists, our society's rulebook is so large and dense, we all live under the threat of making a mistake, and being hit by a code violation, claim denial, warranty rejection, lawsuit, or audit. And what if antagonists want to attack us? It's so easy for anyone with the resources to find "a mistake" and use their Death Star to start a lawsuit, deny a claim, or shut your worksite down.

 Some of these services are on the internet, but they don't empower regular people. Like Blockbuster having a website, regular people still need to call an insurance adjuster, wait for a code inspection, or hope we can afford a good lawyer.

Technologically speaking there's absolutely no reason for this. Linux software is worth billions, it quite literally runs the internet, and even so, we can download it by pressing this button... while accessing the our home insurance policy is a complete mystery.

Only because one industry believes in making you a player god, the other an extra. The truth is, regular people can work as freely as the _Cities: Skylines_ clip above. Open-source software, GPS, smartphones, high-speed internet, AES security protocols, cloud computing, MySQL databases can literally put the power to work without gates or antagonists in your hands!

We could easily make a rulebook that's easy to use, friendly, and reasonable. It could guide you so you fully understand what you should be doing, let you ask informed questions if something doens't make sense, and especially fight back if you think something is wrong.

But this updated rulebook will only be a happy reality once Main Street uses Techvolution as their shield and motivation to bring on the era of mass-collaboration. A modern rulebook is the absolutely the best weapon against Darth Blockbuster, which is why it's worth fighting for.

## Disruption

As a special note to the tech community. Disruption isn't enough anymore. The belief new technology will eventually transform society assumes there's no staunch antagonism fighting for their survival. Disruption mainly replaced low-hanging fruit like consumer goods, but has done nothing for entire industries like legal services, government regulations, corporate employment, public education. After all, lawyers, bureaucrats, human resource reps, unionzed teachers depend on 19th century technology like paper forms, faxes, unreadable contracts, textbooks and chalkboards; they'll never disrupt themselves, why would they?

Techvolution is disruption with the added element that the person being sued, using a regulation, working for a company, raising their kids, is being sold to; not as a consumer, but as a full-blown player god whose fully informed, empowered, and accountable to make choices that change our society. Uber and Airbnb overcoming resistence showcase what I mean. But those are small in comparison to what's need to establish the Internet Age. That's why Techvolution turns extras into player gods; while distuption kept Main Street out of the fight, it's only with their support that you protagonists will defeat the antagonists in our real-life game of civilization.

Black Mirror is the future looked at through the eyes of the past.

## Good Jobs

People get and leave jobs all the time. We start our new job by being introduced to our workplaces, tasks, and co-workers. One thing is missing, we almost never speak with the person whose job we're replacing.

Does this make sense? Just out of practicality, why not get talk about tasks, shortcuts, lessons, and other expertise like if the boss is a shy, a jerk, or a sexual predator.

Something to think about. Because in the era of mass-collaboration we will all learn our jobs better and faster by opening up communication with frontline workers. And we'll also check and balance bad bosses with nothing but a conversation.

## New and Old Celebrities

We celebrate the people we look up to. In the Industrial Age society, our celebrities were often decided for us. The era of mass-production only let a few people make movies, release albums, or get their names in the newspapers.

Internet Age celebrities are different. While we can make fun of Instagram models, silly YouTubers, Twitter trolls, obscure podcasts, but at least in the Internet Age, people watch, listen, read what they want; which also means we celebrate who we want. Personally, I follow people like Sailing La Vagabonde, Adam Savage’s Tested, The Joe Rogan Experience, Dave 2D, Kirsten Dirksen, Taylor Tries, largely because they're people doing cool stuff who'd never consider themselves celebrities.

The next time you hear "celebritiy" ask yourself if they're one of yours. The Internet Age gives you that power.

## #Techvolution, #HappyLife

Techvolution requires people to become "player gods". It may sound high minded, but in reality it's just living life understanding the consequences of our actions. It's not unheard of; in fact we're always improving ourselves. We already learned how Abolitionism ended slavery, but we also did a great job cleaning up society with Environmentalism in the 1960s, and attacking drunk driving and homophobia in the 1980s and 1990s. Today the sustainability culture is helping make people more eco-aware. Each of these movements made us happy in the end.

Millions today Tweet, Post, and Hastag about home renovations, all-inclusive vacations, college graduations because other people care to know. Upgrading our society to the Internet Age requires the same communication. Just about stuff like being debt free, installing solar panels, opening a new small-business.

And we should happily let the people know, because it's their society you're improving.

## Introduction

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(36.25% + 56px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/FragrantOldEmeraldtreeskink' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

The above is a game, of course, but it represents reality pretty well. We're all in there somewhere right now, trying to figure out how to earn a living while the game is played around us. Life can be hard because there is no divine player and no magic buttons. Instead, we, the people inside the game, must collect the resources, do the research, and manually transform every part of our civilization bit by bit, with blood, sweat, and tears. We can't sit back, click, and watch. We must live it.

## Polar Bears in the Amazon

While doing some construction work, I jammed my hand behind some concrete and scratched my watch. So what do I do about it?

The Industrial Age tells me to throw it away, and go buy a new watch. This thinking goes, I should use my job to pay for a mass-production machine to make me another watch.

But, I'm in the Internet Age. So I search "repair scratched watchface", and within a few seconds find out rubbing toothpaste varnishes the scratch away (who the heck would have thought that!).

And this one small examples, shows why we're all polar bears in the Amazon. Seriously, just think of all the people who would have thrown the watch, fridge, or television away. Just look out your car window at all the fellow commuters who own a laptop, hi-speed internet, VR glasses, but are driving through hours of traffic to work in a cubicle.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(36.25% + 56px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/HonoredIndolentBabirusa' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='60%' height='60%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p> <a href="https://gfycat.com/honoredindolentbabirusa-ron-livingston-office-space-endless">via Gfycat</a></p>

If any of us would see a camel near the Great Lakes, eagles inside a cave system, or polar bears in the Amazon, we'd stop and wonder; "why are these biologies here?". Likewise, when we see out of place cyborgologies like textbooks, fax machines, and traffic jammed roads in our societies, we should know something is wrong.

Likely it's that Darth Blockbuster stopped evolution, to keep his obsolete tools in power. The era of mass-production can't let us decide to do the easy thing like repair watches, or work from home. But, until we're free to evolve our lifestyles to do exactly that, we're basically polar bears trying to live in the Amazon

## We're Causing Global Warming

Because we refuse to let go of the Woodstock lifestyle, we're causing our unhappiness to rise, and our planet to burn. Seriously, it's our refusal to adapt new and more efficient ways of life that forces us to use more resources than we should.

Look at the graph below. It displays plastic production. Of course much of this is economic growth. But if that helped America so much, why are we stuck in so much traffic, so in debt, and in general unhappy?

The truth is, to keep his products interesting, Darth Blockbuster has to keep uping the spectacle of his dark majic show.

## The Game of Civilization Life Cycle

All lifeforms—from oak trees to otters—survive by growing into new areas, and then adapting to their new environment. The never ending game of civiliation also has life-cycle of growth and adaptation. The civilization that first masters the technology of a new age, usually spreads itself at the expense of others slow to evolve. But eventually, just like in Nature, the spread of a civilization, leads to the adaption of new civilizations.

In the video below, you can see the huge rise of the British Empire during the Science Age, and then the slow adaption into different countries like the USA, Austrialia, South Africa, and Canada. It's a life-cycle our civlization will always be apart of. Which means ruling philosophies eventually end; even if their supporters love to fight the inevitable.

<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:44%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/6psF6vcajCX7y" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/evolution-maps-cartography-6psF6vcajCX7y">via GIPHY</a></p>

## Frontline Pain

If you have to buy a home, who would you ask to inspect it? A builder, carpenter, engineer? Or a consultant, reporter, executive?

I think most us ask the people who actually build homes. Day in and day out these are the persons who feel the pain of work, and live to solve that pain with better tools and expertise. Yet, at so many of our franchised coffee shops, city bus routes, hospital cleaning departments, it's the second "professional" group making all the decisions. That's a silly thing in the era of mass-collaboration, because frontline pain is a gold mine of knowledge and experience.

Once we discard old ideologies, embrace the era of mass-collaboration with the "click" of a new philosophy, Mom and Pop stores and small businesses will have a resurgence. I smile, thinking of all those bakers, tailors, designers, roofers, engineers, repairmen happily working on a new and empowered Main Street. Each using frontline pain, and Techvolution, to evolve better ways to work in the Internet Age.

## The Levers of Power Isn't More Stuff

The Industrial Age's levers of power were all physical things. Education meant schools, textbooks, teachers. Health care meant hospitals, nurses, doctors. Transportation meant vehicles, roads, and airports.

If we wanted to improve education, health, and transportation, it meant buying, building, or funding more stuff. In the era of mass-production more was always better.

Keep that in mind as we adapt ourselves to the Internet Age. More spending for school textbooks, hospital beds, or roadways are not always good things. In fact, they're often signs we're sticking with "Woodstock" 1969 lifestyle, instead of thinking up more efficient ways to live in the era of mass-collaboration.

![Frontline movies full](/img\diagrams\traffic.jpg)
_I don't have to tell you where this is, because it's everywhere. More roads doesn't solve our transportation problems. Thinking it does, only limits your options as a player god._

## Evolving Society

You get a phone call. It's a collection agency rep who says you owe $23.93 to your old phone company. You remember having a conversation three months ago with another rep who said she waived the charges because you were oversees when the bills were coming in and never made a phone call. But, now this rep is saying you owe money; what do you do?

From experience, I know extras today would have to complain, speak with the manager, and have days of angry phone calls. In the Internet Age, wouldn't it be nice to always have a record of what was said and what your obligations are? It would be, and that's what mass-collaboration requires, but we'll need grab hold of the levers of power of to get there.

## Does The World Need to Know

Darth Blockbuster fights to prevent us reaching for new levers of power. We won't often see him, he heads a heirarchy. There's lots of people inside who fight his cause. Dealing with these BMW drivers, junior execs, or MBA students is sometimes hard. They define success as rising up the ranks. If you're "beneath" them, they assume they're better than you and act like it.

- Sandamías, a village in northern Spain with 67 residents.
- Aartsenia arctica, a sea snail.

Anyone can make a Wikipedia article, so someone out there said, "the world needs to know" about this stuff. But, no one has ever thought that about your personal antagonist. You haven't, have you?

Ignore arrogant pricks. They're not even smart enough to realize their collecting and polishing participation trophies. Now and always, its contributions to win the game of civlization that makes people think; "the worlds needs to know".

## New and Old Celebrities

We celebrate the people we look up to. In the Industrial Age society, our celebrities were often decided for us. The era of mass-production only let a few people make movies, release albums, or get their names in the newspapers.

Internet Age celebrities are different. While we can make fun of Instagram models, silly YouTubers, Twitter trolls, obscure podcasts but at least we can follow who we want; which also means we celebrate who we want. Heck with no gates to overcome anyone can be a musician, artists, comedian or "celebrity." Personally, I follow people like Sailing La Vagabonde, Adam Savage’s Tested, The Joe Rogan Experience, Dave 2D, Kirsten Dirksen, Taylor Tries, Dr. Becky largely because they're real people doing cool stuff who'd never consider themselves celebrities.

The next time you hear "celebritiy" ask yourself if they're one of yours. The Internet Age gives you that power.

## Many More Levers to Make

Where are your medical records? Who has your medical records? Does anyone have your records?

Think about that the next time you're seeing a nurse, doctor, or pharmacist. No one has a complete list of your sicknesses, diseases, shots, sick days, treatments, and pills. After all, why would "they", if you don't?

In the Industrial Age carrying around your medical history was impossible—too much paperwork. In the Internet Age it's a matter of extras becoming player gods. Controlling our own medical records is one of the many levers waiting to be made and contolled by Main Street in the Internet Age.

## Mixing Ideologies

Just to drive home the point, what levers of power does Right/Left politics put in your hand? All those reporters and commentators take up hours of our time, but what real-life object do you get back from them? Do you get a tool to help lower taxes? What about one to fight against income inequality?

The idea doesn't even exist, because both sides think its 1969, when the levers of power weren't for Main Street to hold. Neither Left or Right can understand the Internet Age and mass-collaboration is the best of both ideologies. Modern technology improves social welfare; as Progressives dream, but it also puts the onus on individuals to improve themselves; as Conservatives demand. Mixing ideologies is how Techvolution builds on the past, and helps Main Street prosper once again.#

## Old Philosophy vs. New Philosophy

Techvolution is a philosophy book, but I don't directly reference past philosophies. Like any topic it takes some practice to read. However, let's have a peek and appreciate the strong beliefs of past protagonists and antagonists.

Below are two snippets from two influential philosophers. The passages will help explain how an antagonist can think themselves so right, when history proves them so wrong. I won't comment much on either passage. Just know both of these writers motivated generations of followers to fight to the death.

===

  >SINCE the time that learning began to flourish there has been a common opinion maintained which affirms: "Mankind is naturally endowed and born with freedom, and at liberty to choose what form of government it please, and that the power which any one man has over others was at first bestowed according to the discretion of the people."

  But how this vulgar opinion has of late obtained a great reputation is unknown to me. It is not to be found in the ancient fathers and doctors of the true Church. It contradicts the doctrine and history of the Holy Scriptures, the practice of all ancient monarchies, and the very principles of the law of nature. It is hard to say whether it is more erroneous in divinity or dangerous in policy.

  This desperate assertion whereby kings are made subject to the judgements and deprivations of their subjects follows as a necessary consequence of foolhardy position of the supposed natural equality and freedom of mankind, and liberty to choose what form of government it please.

Patricia, Or the Natural Power of Kings
by Robert Filmer
1680
(I made some edits for readability's sake)
https://www.constitution.org/eng/patriarcha.htm

===

  >We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. —That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, —That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.

Declaration of Independence
by Thomas Jefferson
July 4, 1776
https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript

===

The belief in nobles divine rights wasn't simple selfishness. A lot of smart people wrote philosophy to justify one person having absolute power. The royal rulebook didn't have to call itself a Death Star; it was based on a respected philosophy.

Today, our Death Star rulebook aren't arbitrary rules. They come from Industrial Age philosophy and the era of mass-production. It's important to remember as we push for the Internet Age. The antagonists feel justified using their Death Star. And they'll keep winning, until we believe in a new philosophy. Thomas Jefferson wrote America's new rules, after reading Rousseau's new philosophy.

## The Matrix

## Leaving the Spectacle of the Industrial Age Story

We're already technically in the Internet Age. A quite glance at your smartphone shows that. Our society is in trouble because we're stuck inside the outdated Right/Left, mass-production, philosophy of the Industrial Age. Antagonists don't care, because they're happy inside their stories of self-importance. Main Street doesn't notice because they live inside a story full of spectacle and habit.

Spectacle runs on dark majic. It's really hard to see through. Is the Super Bowl really a national holiday? Are luxurious cars worthy of praise? Is a Bachelors of Arts worth tens of thousands of dollars and four years of life? We can only tell by questioning our society. The best example of how to do this, is the movie The Matrix.

The Matrix shows a dystopian future in which most of humanity is unknowingly trapped inside a simulated 1990's reality called the Matrix. The dream world is created by machines to distract humans while using their bodies as an energy source. The story's hero is Neo. A regular person who asks "what is the Matrix?". His willingness to question reality, eventually gets him recruited by the few untapped humans rebeling against the machines.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(41.60% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/ImpossibleOpenHoverfly' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://gfycat.com/discover/matrix-gifs">from Matrix GIFs</a> 

The rebel Morpheus teachs Neo what the Matrix is. A world of dark majic, to distract the masses from their slavery. Neo at first freaks out. How can the entire world be fake? Soon, Neo realizes the truth, and wants the masses to realize it as well. He believes when the people wake up, they can remove the plug, and re-learn the joy of being player gods in control of their own lives. The machines antagonist, Agent Smith, chases Neo. This antagonist wants to keep people extras, who keep watching the Matrix, and feeding it with power.

Agent Smith can control much of the Matrix, but not all of it. Enforcing the rules of the ruling philosophy of slavery, makes "the agents" bound to its rules too. Neo has a new ruling philosophy of freedom. Thus, he isn't bound by the Matrix's rulebook, a freedom he uses to liberate his oppressed humans.

Neo is a lesson in majic. Because Neo knows learning is his ultimate power. Neo majically learns to jump higher, fight better, shoot straighter, and soon dodges bullets. The machines, unable to match his skills, fight back with more dark majic.

They get one of the freed humans to turn on Neo and his supporters. Not with the allure of power, but with the lure of going back into the comfortable fake world. The familiar spectacle of Rolling Stone concerts, television sitcoms, and V8 engines is all this modern Judas wants. The traitor knows its fake, but will accept it because "ignorance is bliss."

The traitor losses. Neo is too powerful. In the final battle with Agent Smith, Neo is so powerful, he can stop bullets in mid-air. Even better, Neo can see the Matrix's rulebook—the famous green computer code—and can thus rewrite the rules as he wants. A power he uses to kill Agent Smith.

At the end of the story, Neo calls the machines leaders, and tells the antagonists:

  >I know you're out there. I can feel you now. I know you're afraid. You're afraid of us. You're afraid of change. I don't know the future. I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how this is going to begin. I'm going to hang up this phone. And then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world without you. A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries A world where anything is possible. Where we go from there, is a choice I leave to you.

Neo hungs up and starts his new journey. To show the people the Matrix is a lie. A dark majic show to distract them from true political power, which is to be player gods welding levers of power. Only then can they live happier lives on the frontline. In the end, The Matrix is a lesson in liberation. Just as Rousseau's new philosophy was in the real-world.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(41.67% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/OblongGrimyHalibut' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://gfycat.com/discover/fight-gifs">from Fight GIFs</a> <a href="https://gfycat.com/oblonggrimyhalibut-the-Matrix">via Gfycat</a></p>

_Neo learned so much, he sees through the rulebook, and so can easily defeat Agent Smith._

## Lessons From The Matrix

The Matrix is a classic story. Among its lessons, it well showcases how good leaders come and go. Neo was the hero chosen from the masses. Once Neo freed the people, he and his friends return to being equal members of the community. Neo's hierarchy of support was temporary, being based on solving a frontline problem. Perhaps he'll be the hero of the next story, but maybe not. It depends on the problem and who the people decide their hero should be.

Neither art or spectacle stories solve frontline problems. Thus, their hierarchies only last for as long as their storytellers can convince people to watch them, or live inside them. These storytellers are self-important leaders. The masses are just like the people stuck inside the Matrix. Distracted from the truth with a dark majic show, and kept in line with a corrupted rulebook.

The longer the spectacle lasts, the longer the self-important artists, like Darth King, and Darth Blockbuster, can go on living inside self-obsessed stories. They're happy with the way things are. They want to be heroes atop the hierarchy forever. The longer the story goes, the more pretentious they get.

But like an aging sitcom, it never lasts. Eventually, the people's problems pile up, and they soon need a true hero again. That means a hero who can see through the spectacle of the ruling philosophy, and lead the people to become player gods in a new society ruled by a new philosophy that helps Main Street live happy lives.

The lesson is Stargazer your happiness is the best indicator of which story you're currently in. That's why how much money you have, your job title, the university you graduated from, all this is not the definition of happiness. Happiness only happens when a ruling philosophy helps people contribute to a classic story that helps humanity evolve life on Earth. True happiness is being with trusting friends, a loving spouse, healthy kids and hope for an even brighter future.

To defeat Darth Blockuser, we can use our understanding of classic and spectacle/art stories to judge our society. Only when a new philosophy clicks, will we disregard his dark majic and fight off his Death Star rulebook; and thereby usher in the Internet Age. But hold off, it's better to judge our society after reading about its history.

**Good ruling philosophy**: Embraces the modern technological age. Empowers the people with levers of power so they can be player gods who solve problems on the frontline. Civilization is lead by individuals who rise to the occasion to become protagonists. Once their specific problem is over, leaders willfully return to being an equal member of the community.

**Bad ruling philosophy**: Meant to stop humanity progressing to a new age. Led by leaders who don't want to empower the people with modern tools or ever return to equality. Instead, the leaders distract the masses from their selfish leadership, with spectacle.

## Ricky

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(36.25% + 56px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/WarmNippyCockatiel' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

_Ricky Gervais is yelling at a (entertainment) heirarchy so distanced from the frontline, they've completely lost touch with regular people. They virtue signal, as Christian nobility once did, to justify their huge wealth and prestige. There are a lot of parallels between Hollywood elite and late European royals._

## Linus

<https://youtu.be/oOOOfZWXPu4?t=8>
_These guys run a popular YouTube channel about computer hardware. They didn't like how YouTube changed and decided to make a new video service called Floatplane. They thus became Internet Age protagonists. This is real politics. Because it promotes evolution. It doesn't matter if Floatplane thrives or dies. We, as individuals, can only try new ideas and see what works. Marching against climate change, or watching infotainment television is merely being an extra. The struggle with our society is regular people don't think to act like protagonists or player gods. And even worse, it's often against the rules to because Industrial Age companies want us to keep using their obsolete products. We'll overcome these antagonists below._

## Khan

Please take a few minutes and watch this video. It's from Salman Khan, who in the early 2000s was making videos to tutor his cousins. In 2006 he uploaded them to YouTube. They got so popular he (using open-source software) started Khan Academy, a website that gives the world free education in all subjects. After Bill Gates and others funded it, it now empowers us to learn in a better way.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MTRxRO5SRA

I asked you to watch that video to emphasize how real the game of civilization is. The Industrial Age is truly over. It's vital we at the "bottom of the pyramid" learn to live and work in what (I call) the Internet Age and the era of mass-collaboration. When we do, it'll definitely be a "pretty exciting time to be alive."

But, our evolution to new ways of life is never smooth. Just look at education. For all the kids using online courses, there are so many more only using the old-school education system. The gap is enormous. One disturbing statistic is how an entire generation of young Americans now have 1.5 trillion in college debt. That's disgusting. It's far more money then America spent rebuilding Europe after World War II!

That should make your eyes open wide. The hierarchies of the past won't go away on their own. My contribution to our game is teaching everyone—even protagonists like Khan—we don't just evolve better technologies. Humanity has people who benefit from holding us back, and we need a new philosophy to overcome these antagonists before we can live in a new age.

Techvolution will show you how to become a player god. And we must, because only when we take hold of the levers of power will we win the game and live happy lives again. I mean, imagine education was more natural for everyone!

But imaginations aren't reality. To live in the beautiful Internet Age, we must fight our nemesis, Darth Blockbuster.

"_People are angry, man! Most people's lives suck...Even if like the economy is doing better, the vast majority of people aren't doing what they want to do with their lives._" Joe Rogan, November 2019.

Do you think the beloved comedian and podcaster is right? Are people angry? Are your friends and family? Are you?

Let me approach the question differently. Are you happy? I'm not asking if you're comfortable or "happy enough." Do you jump out of bed every morning, are you respected at your job, are your bills paid up. And most importantly, do you think your kids will inherit a better life.

On the surface, North Americans have luxurious homes, full employment, and stable politics. On the inside, our middle-class deals with boring jobs, growing debts, horrible commutes, and mindless bureaucracies. Our lives do often suck. It's made so much worse because, unlike our ancestors, we're also watching our society decline. Everyday bad trends get worse, like drug epidemics, crumbling infrastructure, antisocial behavior, political hatred, and climate change.

Luckily, we have free politics, so we can vote for government solutions and regulations. We've tried giving Left-wing and Right-wing the levers of power. But no matter which we choose, Main Street keeps getting unhappier.

Living happy lives isn't an unrealistic fairytale. In fact, it's a sign of a healthy society. The truth is neither Left or Right ideologies' can help us. They're based in the Industrial Age when government regulations or free-market economics were our only levers of power. Today, these levers aren't strong enough to solve our problems. If no rule allows traffic jams, how can a new one open-up our roads? Ask yourself how many corporate boardrooms want their employees to be financially independent—so how is more corporate employment the best way to secure our livelihoods?

And, now we have a worldwide pandemic. A terrible disease is actually searching the world for human hosts. And despite generations of loyally marching and voting for Left/Right politics, Main Street's only levers of power are reading the news, searching store shelves, and not much else.

We could be doing so much better. We've been in the Internet Age since 1970. With digital technology, we can create amazing tools that put power in our hands. We can eliminate nasty commutes, liberate us from boring jobs, and yes, deal with horrible pandemics with knowledge and skill instead of fear and loathing.

There is a strong Industrial Age establishment. They've been holding Internet Age upgrades back out of pure self-interest. But they aren't the biggest obstacle to a better life. Because, like when printing presses, telescopes, and muskets were invented, the biggest roadblock to our evolution is finding a new philosophy. Only a new way of thinking makes people realize their best option isn't demanding the establishment treat them better. It's the self-realization holding modern levers of power is their only salvation.

Here is our new philosophy. Its big lesson is this. The middle-class must grab hold of apps, computers, and the internet to solve our problems now. If we don't, we'll soon be suffering something much worse than unhappiness and scary pandemics. There's only so much longer we can keep running our civilization on old—ideological—fumes.

## Feedback

Below is the responses to your questions from the prior manuscript

- Comment: The third one seems to be the most “realistic” depiction – the sketch is so good someone might almost mistake it for a photograph.  (Just curious: Is the layer of detail or different style of sketching symbolic, e.g. in that the “Starfleet” is likewise advanced?)
- Reply: Yep. The Starfleet drawing is humanity as seen through the new telescope/Life Star (that's why it's a circle, as if we're looking into our future). Meaning, we'll have far more clarity about ourselves because big data and other modern tech will be like a mirror to us. The Life Star will show us the conseqences of our actions, and thus let us evaluate ourselves according to the scientic method. So we can stop arguing whose methods are the best (liberalism, socialism, antheism, Christianity, etc.) and start making decisions like a physicist would, based on the latest data from the Life Star.

- Comment: I don’t think this is necessary. You don’t have to “explain” yourself to the reader for the metaphors you choose to use. The very next sentence in the paragraph is justification enough.
- Reply: I mentioned YouTube creators, and Star Wars, Harry Potter copyright owners at the start to juxtapose Internet Age v. Industrial Age. Since the owners of the former group would likely love to be mentioned and have helped me write this book, the latter group might look to sue for self-interest. It's my comment on modern copyright, and how it's abused to inhibit creation, instead of promote it.

- Comment: Again, I prefer “opportunity” over “deal” – mostly because I can’t envision the other party on the side of the deal (it takes two to make a deal, yes?).
- Reply: It makes sense, but the "deal" we are making when making a new political community/player god (for example the United States of American in 1776), is with each other. Both terms apply though.

- Comment: I couldn’t find this quote online – can you point it out to me?
- Reply: I think there's better ones, but below is what I found. It's from "On Directing Film" which is a book you'd probably like btw. It's where I learned the most about Aristotle's Poetics.
[If your objective is to succeed in the (movie) "industry," your work, and your soul, will be exposed to these destructive influences. If you desperately crave acceptance by that industry, you will likely become those things..It's a good thing that the people in Hollywood have no souls, so that they don't have to suffer through the lives they lead.]

- Comment: Hmm. I totally see what you mean here, but I’ve been conditioned to think of “power-hungry” as a negative thing for so long (power-hungry politicians and rulers often aren’t a good omen for their country’s/people’s future…) and perhaps your readers might too. Maybe even just add something like “power-hungry and well-meaning”? Then again, maybe your point is to just redefine how we all think about “power”. Not sure. What do you think?
- Reply: I know what you mean, I changed the language a bit. Although, personal power is another word for personal freedom because you can't have one without the other. So when i say power-hungry, I also mean being freedom-loving. After all, without the power of their muskets, the descendents of Revolutionary Minutemen might still be Canadians :) The trick is to be sure, the holders of power, don't use it to deprive other people. And that's why the ruling philosophy is so important. It must work to create more personal freedom, so individuals don't have to take it from others.

- Comment: I’m not sure how relevant these images are in exemplifying people “overcoming” problems. I think they should be, because all the other visuals thus far have been very on-point. It might make more sense to show technology that’s cleaning oceans, technology that’s helping blind people see (braille), technology that’s launching us into space, technology that allows self check-out at the store, etc…
- Reply: This was great advice.

## Backpage 2

These "eight different bosses" gave us unhappy lives. We are wrong to live with it. Because it wasn't only our lives that were being hurt. Our society was being wounded too. Now, instead of using the good times to create a more productive, prepared, and antifragile way of life, we have a scared population, massive economic decline, and general uncertainty in society.

Many prople on Main Street through they were fighting for a better society. We thought marching in Tea Party parade, or watching a Bernie Sanders political speech was going our part to make things better. It wasn't, and it still isn't.

The truth is, to upgrade our lives and our society, we need to upgrade our philosophy.

A lab inspector from the state came, and wanted to know who was running this (lab) machine. And she wanted to be sure they all have high-school diplomas. Well, we had RN degrees, MD degrees. That didn't suffice. She wanted to see high-school diplomas. That's an example of mindless bureaucray. Dr. Eck.

## New Left/Right explanation/breakdown

Policies, manuals, and guidelines aren't today's levers of power. There is no law that promotes climate change, allows unpaid overtime, or encourages car accidents.

Thus, why should we use so much energy to sway government policy when we can grab hold of the new digital levers of power and become player gods who fight climate change, disallow unpaid overtime, and prevents car crashes ourselves?

If you'd rather stay an extra, you can go back to watching the pundits, columnists, and commentators telling you to fight "the enemy" until you're literally blue in the face. You can stay triggered to "hot-topics" like gay marriage, health-care reform, or death taxes.

Fighting for those policy's hasn't gotten Main Street anywhere. Nevermind the fact no matter how hard we push, the other side pushes back to our mutual stagnation. But our ability to say fight back against bad jobs, tax audits, lawsuits isn't increased one bit.

## Player Gods Reach for the Tools and Don't Chase Phantoms

Many people know what a revolution is. The difference between it and Techvolution is a revolution fights to change the rule-makers, while Techvolution fights to distribute new levers of power. Techvolution is better. Because if you still think the rules, regulations, and laws of society control our destiny you're wrong; they don't. I'll show you why.

Talk to any political junkie, no matter when, and they'll say there's a big election coming up. They'll say something like, "if the red team wins this one, then education, healthcare, infrastructure, and everything else will go to shit." What he means is elections decide the rule-makers, and that blue rules make a good society while red rules make a bad one.

If you buy it—and most of us have at some point—you watch blue cable news, read blue blogs, listen to blue talk radio. You start seeing phantom enemies everywhere because your head is filled with blue's philosophy. Soon enough, your car has blue bumper stickers, and you're waving blue bristol boards while screaming blue chants at rallies, marches, and protests. You feel like a hero! You're fighting against the evil red philosophy!... Or, if you got sucked in by the other side, evil blue philosophy!

CAMPAIGNS

Let me ask you this: if you're a regular middle-class person and you ignored the election, how much would you bet that you would know who won just by continuing to live your life?

When Team Blue wins, does traffic suddenly disappear? When Team Red succeeds, does everyone suddenly exercise? Do you breathe fresher air or see fitter neighbors? Do your real-life problems get solved when one color's philosophy writes the rules?

Nothing changes when Main Street elects Conservatism or Progressivism because the truth is; regulations and laws aren't strong enough to solve today's problems. But these are the only levers of power Left and Right know how to use, which is why both ignore the potential of these digital tools.

And it's not their fault.

Right/Left philosophies were created at the start of the Industrial Age. A time when humans only had a few tools at hand. Red/blue philosophical fathers like Adam Smith, Edmund Burke, John Stuart Mill, and Karl Marx never had running water, listened to the radio, made a phone call, opened a fridge, took penicillin, started a motor, typed on a keyboard, or learned about evolution.

![old philosophy in a new world](/img\diagrams\techvolution-mud-roads-sail-boats.jpg)
_Cutting edge technology when Left/Right was born._

Instead, our Right/Left philosophical fathers had mud roads, grandfather clocks, and abacus calculators. Being hungry and sick, cold, and ignorant was a way of life back then. That's why pure individual self-interest was so good at improving society. Rules and regulations could be limited because individuals were already determined to find new technology to help ease their pain.

In fact, Left and Right came together to help them do it. That's why Rightists defend property rights so much. They argued if property is privatized, the more productive it'll be when feeding, employing, or making things for people. Progressive's chimed in, that society needs to share the wealth. Otherwise why would non-property owners be loyal to a community that excludes them.

During the Industrial Age, Left and Right ideologies formed the ideal player god to win the game.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(36.25% + 56px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/SorrowfulPeacefulCuscus' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Right/Left motivated society to improve their primitive world with better tools. And, truth be told, they did! That's why our ancestors agreed on the same big picture; individuals need to globalize the world to industrialize society via mass-production.

Soon enough society upgraded to steam engines, sanitation systems, science labs, telephone networks, broadcast televisions, and computers the size of rooms.

During the Industrial Age, the people needed to be managed inside huge corporations and color-coded parties. Although calling exhausted farmers and overworked factory workers player gods may seem silly, it's not. Someone needed to be using primitive tools to make better ones. To their credit, blue and red philosophies gave regular people a voice in how their factories, regulations, and profits were controlled.

Today, however, we live inside the world the Industrial Age dreamed of making. We've grown a massive ecosystem of cities, factories, offices, telecommunications, and digital technology. The Industrial Age has done its job. It's time to empower the people using the digital tools they worked so hard to create.

Happily, we already are. That's the reason we're so addicted to new technology. Checking news feeds, flying drones, taking endless photos, playing hours of computer games are acts of extras mastering the tools of player gods. Our ancestors did the same when learning about printed books, telescopes, and muskets. Those were merely addictive toys until new philosophies turned them into the lightsabers that finally brought down Darth King and the Medieval Age. When regular people could read unknown history, see the universe for themselves, and revolt against royalty the game was won.

Our addicting toys are also new levers of power. They're so powerful, we can use these proverbial lightsabers to earn a happier life. We will, once we forget about Left/Right phantoms, and use Techvolution to defeat Darth Blockbuster, his Death Star, and upgrade to the Internet Age.

_Compare this person to Leftists marching for "climate justice" or Rightists for "lower energy taxes." Isn't this the person you'd want to play your game of civilization? A regular person using a modern tool to improve his energy efficiency, increase his power, and improve his society. And once we've done our daily work, we can play basketball, watch a movie, or do whatever else we want. We just shouldn't chase phantom communists or fascists. We're better off sealing or replacing our, or someone else's, drafty windows. And if you think government regulations should force people to act like this, you'll end up fighting them. It's better to think of ways to make it easier, and more profitable, to make good decisions._

Expecting Left and Right ideologies to help our evolve, would be like asking a captured animal to adapt to its native environment. A polar bear in a zoo has no idea the artic is melting. It's impossible for it to evolve to a changing environment unless it feels frontline pain.

That's why Main Street must evolve on its own. We're the ones feeling the growing unhappiness of everyday life.frontline pain. Especially during this pandemic, we're being forced to find new ways to harvest resources so far unthought of in humanity.

## Call Centre Example

For example, one time in car claims, a customer called asking, "Why did you send me to collections!". I was baffled because I didn't, nor could I; I could only approve or deny claims. It turns out the rental car company didn't send their bill, and when it wasn't paid sent our mutual customer to a collections agency. I called the rental company told them they were idiots, and sent them their 100 odd dollars check.

Even when the customer did nothing wrong, he still had to deal with three company call centres to fix a problem. Worse, he was left wondering what was going to happen to his credit rating. The rental car company, collections agency, credit rating company, and even me, faced no repercussions because the only lever of power the customer had was to complain.

## Fighting example

The game of life is like a street-fight. No rules apply. Ideologues are like boxing, judo, or akido coaches. They train to fight, but only in their discipline. Without experience in real fighting, coaches trick themselves into believing kicking, chokeholds, or cheap shots are "against the rules."

# THE APPENDICES

## Other Stuff

Hello. Thanks for sticking around. The appendices is some stuff I couldn't fit into the narrative of the book, but I thought might be cool to know.

## Bears Everywhere, Polar Bears Only In Some Places

I never wanted to write this book. Most of this book is based on combinining the lessons of evolutionary biology and political philosophy. I think they're the same field of study, so similar they suggest a supreme physical life field of some kind. I used my take on political societies earned by using Aristotle's Poetics to better understand Hegelian Dialectics. It's work I did years ago. There's a lot to it—a genuine work of science forthcoming in _How to See the Matrix_—but it's original thinking will need the objective data from the Life Star to prove.

Most people are extremely bad at understanding their political opinions. While it's kinda of easy to get people to question their ideas, they'll revert once released back into the community. Psychology, upbringing, temperment, education, life experience, and all that intermix to form our politics. Only the Life Star can help us decode this jumble.

Because it'll show us our never-ending game of civilization; another way of saying human evolution. Human life does what all lifeforms do and gathers resources, grows, and diversifies. And it's this last point that has proven to hard for me to explain.

There's no way around the game of civilization. Like evolution to lifeforms, we all are inside it. It's paint by numbers. Tracks on the road. We all live and die under it's demands. Playing a Civilization computer game is really the best way to understand it. In the game, every player starts off small, then gathers resources, invests them smartly, and grows. Playing the game teaches the importance of geography, technological upgrades, adopting modern philosophies, defeating everyone who opposes you, investing in research and development, avoiding building palaces to host jewellery laden banquets and balls.

But no computer game forces the player into diversification or "adaptive radiation." In every game a player tries to take over the world with his one civilization. Never does the player have to segment himself into different civilizations. But, in natura this life-cycle of seed, growth, then adaption and diversificationns happens to all lifeforms and thus all civilizations. Few people realize how human cyborgology is the same as biology.

Polar Bears are nearly identitical to Brown Bears. But they're polar for a good reason. If they didn't adapt to the cold, water, and food supply, they've never live in the Artic. Thus, life diversified them. Adaptation is why we can't send the suffering polar bears to the Amazon, or even Antartica. They are not adapted to the climate in one area, and the ecosystem in the other. Imagine penguins with a few antartic polar bears walking around. Happy feet indeed.

The point is this. We evolve just like any other lifeform. But we evolve with tools, and we evolve in ages. So we start off small, grow, and diversity in waves. Each new age, is like new lifeforms, new cyborgs, spreading across the world for the first time. Look at the European Powers below, who colonized the world a few generations ago during the Age of Discovery.

<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:44%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/eSItBDecz3oJy" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/maps-cartography-territories-eSItBDecz3oJy">via GIPHY</a></p>
_This same thing is happening to the world-wide economy. We just don't have the philosophy to understand why, so we fight back against forces of Nature and adaptation._

The European Powers spread advanced civilization far and wide. Brutally in some cases—has anyone invented a way to spread new civilization or new life easily? But that's the point. Evolution doesn't care about individuals. Evolution is the rulebook by which life seeks out new and better ways to prosper.

So life spreads far and wide with no consideration for the lifeforms already there. But once the victors are declared, life no longer needs to spread, but now diversify into many different ecosystems. Ecosystems is how life stays fit, ready to adapt to an dangerous world. Thus, when the Age of Discoverty ended, it started the Age of Revolutions. Revolutions was life making human ecosystems as the GIF shows above.

Life thus has a two step process. One age of growth, the other of diversification. And this explains sooooo much of our politics today. The Industrial Age was one of world-wide growth. The second step, Internet Age, is one of diversification. And we're in this diversification phase right now. But nobody knows it, because we still use the Right/Left, era of mass-production philosophy of the Industrial Age.

So Trump and Brexit were inevitable. Our society wants to diversity after the Industrial Age. This is part of the game of civilization we all play, but few see the entireity of. That's why the established powers of the Industrial Age were so suprised, and have so much hatred, for nativist politics in the West. Although nativist politics isn't the future. Like the English Civil War, they're using old philosophies to try and make fundamental change. Only Techvolution, conscious adaptation using modern tools, is the new philosophy for our new Internet Age.

I plan to write a textbook on Techvolution (How to See the Matrix), I'll love to now delve more into the game of civilization for you., and teach you how to decode the trends of history: what a civil war is, how to predict a revolution, and so forth. The game defines our lives in so many ways, because it determines the roles we play in our lives. The accident of birth to parents, geography, or time-period makes us antagonists, protagonists, extras and player gods. Few people understand their role, and a insight might help you choose Techvolution. But that'll come later. Hopefully.

## The End of One Game, and the Beginning of a New One

This section is my personal opinion, so take it for what it's worth to you.

The Western World is a made up term. Don't get me wrong, it's a good way to describe the shared culture of France, Britain, Holland, America, Austrialia and the other members of the political unit we call "The West". But if you look down at the globe, these landmasses wouldn't look united. The West is a human creation. There was no "Western Europe" in Roman times. The entire Mediterranean Sea and surrounding land was unified under the Roman Empire.

It wasn't until western Rome fell in 476, and North Africa was conquered in the 700s, that what we call Western Europe became isolated, and hence got its own identity. It was these once barbarian germanic tribes, newly converted to Christianity and loyal to the idea of Rome, who laid the seeds for Western Civilization. The first kings of Western Europe survived the Dark Ages. They slowly returned civilization in the Medieval Ages. By the time the Renaissance Age came, Western Europe was doing quite well. But it was in the Science Age and the Industrial Age that the West saw their power grow world wide.

If the world had ended in 1900, The West would have won the game of civilization. Western Europe didn't have a head start. They didn't have any sort of advantage. If it's geography, resources, genes, or whatever were the reason for the West's rise to power, why did Rome fall. Why did Western Europe suffer so greatly in the Dark Ages if they had advantages available to no one else?

Western Europe conqured the world, because it used modern technology better than any other civilization. That's because philosophy is a gift. It lets humanity invent and use new and better tools. Ancient Greece got it first, then it went to Rome, then to Middle East in the Islamic Golden Age, back to Italy in the Renaissance, where it spread to Western Civilization during the Science and Industrial Age, and thereafter to the world via European colonialization.

Updating, or "clicking", a new philosophy is pivotal when playing civilization games for a good reason. Our real-life societies have to keep upgrading. Because the game of civilization never ends. Famines, wars, prosperity, climate change; clicking new philosophies is the only way to keeping inventing new tools, harvesting more resources, and surviving the game. There are antagonists inside every society. That's no excuse to stop playing. The rest of society either defeats them, or their civilization is replaced by another player and the idle extras still lose; their biological DNA (what genes we pass on) and cyborlogical DNA (what tools we pass on) is out of the gene pool either way.

Playing Civilzation, Anno 1800, or any other game is a better education than the best schooling today. These games mimick real-life, and thus integrate so many lessons. They force players to think of the big picture that's so hard to appreciate in real-life. It's an invaluable perspective, especially to our society which is so obessed with itself, inside our spectacle, and art stories.

Our culture is very entrenched in the Industrial Age. So many people live to take credit for titles, instead of accomplisments. Professors, managers, executives, union leaders, all cherish the title of Industrial Age heirarchies. These well-intentioned people don't want to return back to equality that happens at the start of every new age. They refuse to upgrade our philosophy. Or they want someone else to do the hard work. The result is, the West is in the process of losing the game.

We are in an entirely new age. The Internet Age is just as historical and powerful as the Science Age. And nobody has earned victory over it yet. Africa, South America, East Asia, Middle East, India, Eastern Europe, any civilization in the world is no better off then the West. Actually, I'd say, the West is far behind in the race to win the era of mass-collaboration.

In all my schooling, reading, discussing, working, in all my life, the ancestors of the barbarian kings, the ones whose grand parents worked 365 days a year in horrible English factories, who suffered famines in Ireland, draughts in France, and wars throughout Europe, the ones who worked the labs in New York, who worked the mines of Pennsylvania, the lines of Michigan, who solved millions of different problems during the Science and Industrial Ages as player gods; their grandkids today simple don't want to feel frontline pain. And without pain, they fell no reason to change update to the Internet Age. As one sharp observer noted to me "it's like they've folded their cards."

It's why so many of todays Western protagonists and player gods are foreigners. Also why so many tortured souls are born with irrationality (conspiracy theories and mental illness) in western society. Society is using their curse, to be irrational against the corrupt rulebook, and start (involuntarily) discovering the just rulebook of the next age. Irrational people are the most likely to see through the Matrix and start the rebellion. Their curse is to live the rebellion of the mind all the time. The laziness of their society, dooms them to miser. It's like these poor minds been clicked to find a new path for the rest of people to follow. That's the rationality of irrationality. The longer we hold off upgrading, the most cursed minds our society is forced to make.

Fighting to delay the upgrade, is also why so many antagonists import extras (illegal immigration, migrant crisis, legal immigration) into the West, because they know desperate people are inherent extras, and only a society of extras, keeps antagonists of the Internet Age in power in the 21st Century. With so many non-members, the West will likely not be able to form a new Internet Age player god. Said differently, the West can't form a community again, because most everyone inside either thinks they individually are self-sufficient and can spend their days watching sports on TV, walking their dog, and having a few casual friends. Or people in the West have a hyphenated identity of Blank-American. A player god is a community, the era of mass-collaboration needs a community of members, and the West has little of community left.

_This the Antagonist Executive at work. No jokes, too many know how real this is. Darth Blockbuster's delusion of being the leader, despite personal incompetence, lasts until player gods rise up. I feel like I'm watching Charles trying to make battle plans. I can't help but see "the decline and fall" in this sketch._

Modern technology is so powerful, it overcomes any natural drawback like language, geography, or history some places in the world have. That means the winner of the Internet Age is up for grabs. I don't know who will win. I do suspect though, the people of the West are dead-set on celebrating away their ancestors glory, quite literally living off their inheritance, and happily going down with the ship that was Western Civilization. With so much to gain from complacency, evolution is an unreasonable risk; especially when there's often no pain felt. I can't help but see "the decline and fall". Not of a state or government, but the civilization itself.

One thing I do know, that whichever society throws away the memories, excuses, and philosphies of the past, and embraces Techvolution and the era of mass-collaboration, will be the winner of the Internet Age. It's their player god who will happily reign supreme for many years in the never ending game of civilization. I smile, thinking of all those bakers, tailors, designers, roofers, engineers, cleaners, repairmen, and maybe even a few majicians, smiling on a new and empowered Main Street.

Hopefully they'll colonize the West, and so, bring on the Internet Age to the world. At least with this book, those people in what remains of the West, can read what their grandparents could have done as they regret the choices of player gods who lost because they refused to play the game.

## Stuff I Couldn't Fit In

I tried to make Techvolution very readable. Almost all the topics and subjects are metaphors for the lessons Europe learned going from the Dark Ages, through the Medieval Ages, to the Science Age, Enlightenment Age, and finally the Industrial Age. So there was a lot of stuff to fit it. If you're a history or philosophy nerd, I hope you realize why I synthesized things the way I did. The benefit was, by keeping things simple, I was forced to better understand the content.

Without changing our path (which I mentioned above, I can only hope is coming) The West really is headed towards societal failure, a new version of the Thirty Years War. That's not supposed to sound alarmist. It's a diagnosis using our history. Every new age needs a new philosophy that unites the people into thinking of the big picture and making a new player god. Unless we create a player god in an era of mass-collaboration soon, we wont stay ahead of our problems and people will fight for a better life using the philosophy of the past; just like our ancestors fought against Catholicism and Protestantism when the real enemy was selfish, effeminate nobility.

If I could travel back to 1618 to those very unhappy Europeans on Main Street, I'd say the same thing to them I told you. But they wouldn't believe it because I'd be talking about the future. With you it's been the past. There's a better chance it'll all click.

By clicking of course I mean upgrading our philosophy. While there are always lots of lessons in all philosophy books, in the game of civilization certain cards or philosophical upgrades are much more important than others. For reference, here's some of the lessons our ancestors taught us in blood, sweat, and tears, and I used in this book.

===

**Modernity**: Inspired by the Renaissance, and started during the Age of Enlightenment. Modernity makes the point when we got modern technology and made modern philosophies. The printing-press, telescope, microscope, and so forth, let humanity develop better philosophies to explain Nature. If I were to have written this book another way, I'd have said modernity is hitting the social sciences, as it did years ago to the physical sciences. Postmodernism and its friends in Left and Right, are phantom chasing geocentrics trying to validate their bygone belief system against the rising tide of evidence a new philosophy is needed.

The point it, we can take all the lessons of the first wave of modernity, and apply it to the second, which is what I did here by referencing the works from Machiavelli to Hegel, but excluded anyone after, because none of them integrated the technological possibilities of the Internet Age. They are like the geocentrics who tried to keep everyone believing the Earth stood still, even after a new and better philosophy was being discovered.

That's why science fiction writers are much better to study then any post modern (supposed) thinker.

**Phantom Communists and Fascists**: The Renaissance, and Scienge Age, was kicked started by Nicolo Machiavelli, who was among the first to implore humanity study cause and effect, to improve our lives on Earth. He asked his contempories to ignore the  "Imagined Principalities" of religious people, who had the people ignoring their real-life pain, because of a belief they'll be rewarded in the afterlife. Any philosophy based on the way things ought to be, had people complain about the real-world, instead of accepting the facts of life, and trying to improve them. Machiavelli called heaven "Imagined Principalities".

Christian belief about an afterlife helped Medieval peasants stay loyal as their community was slowly rebuilding civlization. But by the Renaissance and afterward, only thikning of the afterlife was a needless distraction. Civilization had upgraded, and needed Main Street to start being selfish and take the lead as scientists, doctors, writers and so forth.

I'm making the same point here. That Main Street is distracted from modern philosophy, by holdovers. Just as geocentrics stayed alive by telling the population about "heretic Galileo!", so does our old philosophies stay alive by cries of "they're evil". Instead of "Imagined Principalities" we have "Phantom Communists and Fascists".

**Frontline**: is Machiavelli's "effectual truth." Machiavelli came from a relatively poor family. But he was well educated, and his father gave him many books from the recent printing press. Machiavelli was the first philosoper to get to read lots of different philosophy and history books, and he noticed trends. He told superstitious Europeans, they didn't need to put their faith in God, because we can keep looking for trends, master them, and start to overcome problems like hunger, disease, and all that.

Soon later Galileo, Francis Bacon, and lots of other people, read this insight, and invented the Scientific Method, which systemized looking for "effectual truth" by simply testing Nature with instruments, and discovering the truth, not inventing it with beliefs or reason. Hence, true truth is the "point of contact" between a tool and it's use. That's true in a scientific experiment that upgraded the physical sciences. And now, it's true in the second wave of modernity that will upgraded the social sciences. And for that, the frontline of everyday life is where we'll find the true answers; not the rules of the social or noble heirarchy.

**Player god**: Is my way of saying political community, what Plato called "politia". My version comes from Thomas Hobbes. He lived during the English Civil War, when people were again sick of the king but didn't yet have a different ruling philosophy to replace him with. Hobbes invented human equality by saying in Nature (he called it the State of Nature), all lifeforms live freely, thus why shouldn't humans. Hobbes said people should still be loyal to a king, but not because the king is divine, but because one person having absolute power is in everyone's best interest to have a stable and firm government. When that goes away—as Hobbes was personally seeing—people turn horrible.

And this is what I mean by each philosophy contributed partial upgrades. Because while we don't have kings anymore, yet we use much of Hobbes reasoning. John Locke came after Hobbes and agreed with his State of Nature, but said the people didn't need to put all their trust into a person as leader, but instead put their trust in the institution as leader. Meaning, the people should follow a president, not a king. Moreever, government should be split into different responsibilities for executive, legislature, and judicial. This way, each will "check and balance" each other, and thus government will still function, but won't be easily corrupted and become worse than the anarchy it's supposed to solve.

Rousseau later came and said a true democracy is made up of the people. Unlike Hobbes/Locke, who said humanity was not born from a chaotic Nature, but a kind one. In fact, it's society that corrupts people into being evil. Thus, it's up the way society is structured to ensure the best of humanity is brought up, instead of repressed. Rousseau made the connection that individuals make up their society, so if each individual reformed themselves, they'd all make a better society.

While Rousseau's visions lead to a lot of social engineering disasters. Modern technology and especially open-source, is so liberating, and so individually empowering, we can make a good and just player god. We can have the best of both worlds, a stable government and society, that doesn't need to, and in fact can't, oppress the people.

**The Game of Civilization**: Hegel's March of Reason. G. W. F. Hegel (1770– 1831) distinguished mere fact from history, or from what he called World History. He was the master of the philosophy of history. Rather than let fact silence reason, he tried to infuse reason into fact; he saw the “march of Reason” in the facts of World History. World History, he tried to show, developed in “dialectical” stages until the Rational State was perfected—which by good chance (so Mansfield says) turned out to be the very state of Prussia in which Hegel was living. Here was the end (in the sense of the completion) of history: a state without parties in which there is nothing fundamental left to dispute. Yet as soon as the rational state was announced, everybody—Marx and Nietzsche in the forefront—scrambled to dispute it. Even as Hegel was writing, Tocqueville reproved the sort of democratic history that subjects human events to impersonal forces over which men have no control and that levels mankind to a herd of impotent individuals.

I never read Marx or Nietzche. There was something about inspiring evil that had me stay away. Instead I read science fiction writers, they had the imagination to see the future based on our tools, not on the history of philosophy.

**The Game of Civilization vs. The Story of Civilization**: Or being a player god vs. being an extra. This is Machiavelli's "wised up". Meaning when a civilization is self-aware it takes its survival seriously and not for granted, and thus plays the game, instead of passively watching the events as if it can't determine it's own outcome.

**Your Happiness**: The best gauge on how healthy the player god is.

**Heirarchy**:: is from the friction of distance. The farther people are from the pain, the more likely they're disregard it. So for all her faults, Sofia Auld did teach an enslaved person to read. That's only because she spent time with him everyday. Natural humanity comes out with empathy. And empathy needs to be seen, heard, and felt to exist. That sad truth was, the further away a slave owner was, the more terrible their treatments of slaves. I hate talking like this, and so did Douglass, but a house slave was treated better than a farm slave, who was better off than a plantation slave, who was better off than a colonial slave whose (asshole) "owners" were in a different country. Proximity brings more humanity.

Feeling the pain is the best way to respond to it. The further one is from the frontline, the less natural morality and ethics will prompt a humane response. We use products made by slave labour because we don't feel or see it. Civlizations need heirachries, but with better technology, we don't as much. Thus as civilization needs better technology, that inevitable means dismantling heirarchies is progress.

**The Power of Stories**: Aristotle's Poetics, and especially David Mamet's On Directing Film. Learning storytelling so darn well, it's layers and components, characters and motivations, is what I used to intepret Hegelian dialectics. I'm writing "How to See the Matrix" using these tools. It's much more detailed analysis of all this stuff.

**Ruling philosophy**: comes from Aristotle's regime. Regime is the form of government or the set of rules, cultural or social norms, etc. that regulate the operation of a government or institution and its interactions with society. Aristotle noted  the forms of government are democracy, oligarchy, aristocracy, monarchy. The supreme right to judge and decide is with with either a part or the whole of one or other of these governing powers; which together make up a socieyt's regmine or ruling philosophy.

A Democracy is a form of government under which the citizens distribute the offices of state among themselves, whereas under oligarchy there is a property qualification, under aristocracy one of education. By education I mean that education which is laid down by the law; for it is those who have been loyal to the national institutions that hold office under an aristocracy. These are bound to be looked upon as 'the best men', and it is from this fact that this form of government has derived its name ('the rule of the best'). Monarchy, as the word implies, is a rule which one man has authority over all. There are two forms of monarchy: kingship, which is limited by prescribed conditions, and 'tyranny', which is not limited by anything.

We must also notice the ends which the various forms of government pursue. The end of democracy is freedom; of oligarchy, wealth; of aristocracy, the maintenance of power, education, and national institutions; of tyranny, the protection of the tyrant.

**Protagonist and antagonist**: is Hegel's Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis dialectics. After centuries of histories, looked back at the trends, and said there was a ruling philosophy, whose problems manifested into a competitor, the two would eventually fight it out, and make a new ruling philosphy that merged the two together. He also said master–slave is a relationship that recurs throughout humanity, and is the reason we looked at Frederick Douglas and Neo, who while was the physical slave, his captors were the mental ones, bound to a horrible social system as much as Frederick was. Frederick's process of self-discovery, was how slaves realize their status and break free.

**Cyborgology, majic, frontline**: are Darwinism. The evolution of lifeforms based on their tools to collect resources. Life started out as simple organisms, and as these primitive lifeforms struggled to survive, they adapted better —biological—tools to do so. Eventually the benefits of biology maxed out with us, and so we have to continue evolution with tools. We similarly started to evolve (techvolve) with primitive tools, which slowly got better and better.

**Mixed Ideological Politics**: This didn't make it into ANP. But it's based on the separation of Church and State. Except now it's the separation of ideology and economy.

**The Death Star**: working insurance :)

**Freedom to use any tool**: Comes from freedom of religion and speech. John Locke and his A Letter Concerning Toleration, gets the nod here.

**Dark majic**: come from modern psychology. All of this is hard to understand. It seems simple because it's your life, and you think your opinions matter. But there's a reason we go to the doctor when we're feeling sick. They know the human antonmy, and we don't, even though we own one.

**Techvolution**: Comes from me. It synthesizes all that we've learned, into a new philosophy for a modern age. I attributed much of it to playing computer games, reading and watching science fiction, and working lots of frontline jobs. Playing, reading, and living in the future made the old philosophies of 20th Century politics so old fashioned. Putting it all together into a book took lots of reading, thinking, and working. Some intelligence helped, but it was the stubborness to keep going, and the belief in a higher power, that deserves the most credit. I hope it was worth it.

===

So, that's where it all came from. Machiavelli taught regular people to stop hoping for a better life, and start making one. Hobbes/Locke taught us our government can be instruments for liberty. Rousseau said we, the people, could make up government if we empowered our better natures. Hegel taught us the difference between Protagonsits and Antagonists, Player Gods, and Extras. Galileo taught us to use tools to see the Truth. Darwin taught us life is nothing but the evolution of new tools. And Majic, he taught us that technology is an extension of life, that player gods can use to improve this world, once we believe in ourselves. Or he wasted far too much time writing to himself. Either way, it's confusing and fitting Faith made him keep going.

I spent my 20's wondering what the next few pages of "A Student's Guide to Political Philosophy" were going to be. Even weirder, like Newton using his own eyes for lenses, I used myself as a proxy for life under the Life Star. A life of austerity, simplicity, childish honesty, great friendships, and self induced hypersensity to all frontline pain so easily brushed aside by extras. I feel confident to say I now know the next few pages of our political philosophy because I wrote and lived it; although I'd never pay the price again.

Cheers.

## new intro idk

Talk to any political junkie, no matter when, and they'll say there's a big election coming up. They'll say something like, "if the red team wins this one, then education, healthcare, infrastructure, and everything else will go to shit." What he means is elections decide the rule-makers, and that blue rules make a good society while red rules make a bad one.

If you buy it—and most of us have at some point—you watch blue cable news, read blue blogs, listen to blue talk radio. You start seeing phantom enemies everywhere because your head is filled with blue's philosophy. Soon enough, your car has blue bumper stickers, and you're waving blue bristol boards while screaming blue chants at rallies, marches, and protests. You feel like a hero! You're fighting against the evil red philosophy!... Or, if you got sucked in by the other side, evil blue philosophy!

Let me ask you this: if you're a regular middle-class person and you ignored the election, how much would you bet that you would know who won just by continuing to live your life?

When Team Blue wins, does traffic suddenly disappear? When Team Red succeeds, does everyone suddenly exercise? Do you breathe fresher air or see fitter neighbors? Do your real-life problems get solved when one color's philosophy writes the rules?

Policies, manuals, and guidelines aren't today's levers of power. There is no law that promotes climate change, allows unpaid overtime, or encourages car accidents.

## The Pharmacist

TP PICTURE
_Regular people should be collaborating with health professionals, their co-workers, their family to find out how we can best deal with this storm._

We've had Internet Age technologies for years. We should have been evolving a more prepared and antifragile way of life. For example, most insurance companies pay claims in paper checks. Although not officially said, it's likely because the longer the insurance company delays giving out the money, the longer they make interest on it.

This one quirk is (probably) a big reason why our society doesn't have digital processing for car, property, health, and unemployment claims. And, thus, why many today can't pay their bills during this crisis.

Nevermind speeding up our lives, Internet Age technology can even proactively solve our problems. For example, watch [The Pharmicist](https://www.netflix.com/ca/title/81002576) on Netflix, and you'll see how a simple online database of prescriptions stopped oxycontin pill mills. Too bad it took bureaucrats and politicians many years to make. If done sooner, we would have found out which pushy drug salesman and corrupt doctors were responsible for the oxycontin epidemic.

In fact, with open-source software (the free technology that makes programs like Instagram possible), the public could have banded together and built a secure and straightforward prescription database that would have prevented [500,000 doctors prescribed opioid overdoses.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_epidemic_in_the_United_States)

But, the people on Main Street didn't use internet technologies to upgrade our civilization. Instead, we listened to Right and Left bicker, and "eight different" bosses drone on about paperwork, memos, and mission statements.

## To Upgrade Our Civilization We Need To Reach for the Tools

Do you love stories? I alread know you do. I think it's a safe bet to say that you do. Who doesn't? They entertain us after a hard day of work, bring us together to share our joys, and (my favorite) open our minds. Stories show us the different rules, philosophies, and technologies of foreign cities, mythical worlds, and galaxies far far away.

Stories are so compelling because they're so simple. Protagonists are good because they want to fix a problem. Antagonists are bad because they don't. Stories aren't debates. We take the protagonist's side. Thus, Romeo and Juliet's love is beautiful and worth dying for, while their families' feud is ignorant and stupid. Luke Skywalker's rebellion is righteous and worth fighting for, while Darth Vader's empire is wicked and should be destroyed.

Our moral clarity about a problem turns the protagonists into our heroes and the antagonists into our villains. We follow their story with strong emotions—which burst out at the climax as we find out who wins.

Our hero fights hard to defeat the bad guys, but his superior morality, justice, and heroism aren't enough. He's often too weak or unskilled, and the villain beats him bloody. On the verge of failure, the hero needs to find something that'll turn the tide in his favor. He seeks, sees, and reaches for his salvation: a tool or a weapon, like a gun, magic book, or lightsaber.

Will our hero reach it first, or will the enemy? We, in the audience, like extras in the story, hold our breath because the story's society is controlled not by marches, protests, or rules, but by which character holds the levers of power. The wielder is the victor. The victor writes the laws.

It's the lesson that we the people need to learn for ourselves.

Because only when we reach for and hold the levers of power, do we stop watching our civilization on television and radio, marches and parades, and start playing it. Only when we hold our levers of power will we be player gods of the Internet Age.

## Segway 

One asking regular people to step up. Because doing our job, shopping a lot, voting every four years is not enough to earn a healthy society. We can't assume Big Government or Big Business will educate our kids, make a healthy medical system, or provide a reliable livelihood.

If we make relatively small changes now, we'll save ourselves so much grief in the future.

I know this because of this one historical fact. The Industrial Age ended in 1969. The Internet Age started in 1970. Since this handoff, the middle-class has gotten better technology in our private lives. But, the Industrial Age middlemen have blocked our evolution to a digital way of life. We can't keep pushing back the upgrade.

Thankfully regular people can unpower the middlemen with our own "two-way radios." Modern apps, computers, and the internet are that mighty.

Only if the specialists on Main Street reach for the power. If they do, the doctors, mechanics, therapists, makers, sewists, technicians, plumbers, educators, everyone with a frontline skill, can hold our society's levers of power once again. Only then will the middle-class pay down our debts, eliminate nasty commutes, erase micro-management, and deal with pandemics with skill instead of makeshift plans.

To get to this new world, Main Street needs a new philosophy.

Here it is. Its big lesson is this. The middle-class must solve our problems with digital technology now. If we don't, we'll soon be suffering something much worse than unhappiness and scary pandemics. There's only so much longer we can keep running our civilization on the fumes of Left and Right ideology before our debts explode, or bureaucracies implode, and our bullshit jobs aren't worth working anymore.

## Angels and Demons On Our Shoulders

I'm not sure if you know this Stargazer, but the Devil was once an angel. The angel Lucifer was his name. He lived with God up in the clouds with the rest of the heavenly beings. These angels were tasked to educate us about virtue, morality, and ethics so we can become protagonists and player gods.

But Lucifer rejected God's teachings. He grew vain, greedy, and deceptive. Soon he even challenged God's will. In response, God threw Lucifer down from Heaven to be the Dark Lord of Hell.

Free from God, Lucifer grew his evil powers. Soon he was the Devil, who taught humanity the vanity, greed, hubris, and selfishness they'd need to become antagonists and extras.

But Lucifer kept his angelic form.

So, while anyone can be a saint, anyone can also be a demon. That is why the choice of good and evil, protagonist and antagonist, extra and player god, always rest on our shoulders and attracts us to either side.

The trick for humanity is to resist our demons and embrace our angels. That's how we can be player gods who do what's best for ourselves and help society prosper.

Angels and demons are the Christian tales of good and evil. Most religions share a similar story though. The story of Lucifer even echoes throughout human literature. Harry Potter's Lord Voldermort, The Lord of the Rings Lord Sauron, and Star War's Lord Vader were all once heroes. Each grew evil because they were unwilling to give up their power; they were corrupted by ambitions of lifelong supremacy.

The story of vanity, greed, and hubris is probably so prevalent in our religions and literature because it's so common in humanity; power often corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.

Darth King thought he was an angel.

No joke. During the Age of Enlightenment, philosophers like Voltaire, Hume, and Rousseau were writing about improving humanity with ideals of freedom and compassion. Believe it or not, the nobility liked these values.

After all, the leaders believed they were protectors of their flock. That's why monarchs with the absolute power of life and death over their subjects, such as Frederick I, Emperor Joseph II, and Catherine II, called themselves "enlighten monarchs."

The trending royal mentality was, "Everything for the people, nothing by the people."

We can see how self-serving this mentality is. Why couldn't the nobles pay taxes? Why couldn't the people have a fair judicial system? Enlightened monarchs preached one thing and did another. The point is Darth King wasn't evil for being born into nobility. He is evil for holding his people back. He wanted them to be extras watching the story of civilization, and not player gods playing the game of civilization.

When a regular person rose himself up with hard work and innovation, a royal felt justified to take ownership of his work and spend the rewards as he wanted.

The nobles thus became fallen heroes. And sadly, this story of fallen kings is repeating itself in our modern times. Our antagonists are also heroes fallen from grace.

## Telecommuting

One thing I have to get off my mind. "Working from home" doesn't mean working in your PJs. Telecommuting is more about **not** working from a set place. Being free to work might mean working from your home office. But it also might mean working at a clients house after a house fire. Or maybe at a local shared office place to collaborate with colleagues for the day.

We've already seen how custom designed software can oversee everyone's contributions better than "eight different bosses". Deciding where to work should consider the return on investment for fuel savings, insurance costs, vehicle wear and tear, and most important, saved time.

## Rome's damn fall maybe I'll add if i can verify this, although it makes sense to me

This was the start of the "noble divine right to rule." Believe it or not, divine nobility was an upgrade. The Roman Empire fell apart because its generals kept fighting each other to be Emperor. Rome had, on average, a civil war every four years. Making political power "divine" in the new European kingdoms may have excluded the ordinary people from having a say. Still, it at least stopped anyone with an army sending the country into chaos.

## What You Can Do Today

While the antagonists are fighting it, the era of mass-collaboration is already here. We've already seen examples of Uber, Airbnb, and Wikipedia. But there are many more.

These websites below let you change the world today. Right now.

User Feedback: Most apps and websites have a "Feedback" option. These buttons are not for show. In fact, designers and programmers love hearing from users. You can feel good about donating your thoughts. Because it saves tens, hundreds, to maybe millions of people from the same problem.

[Galaxy Zoo](https://www.zooniverse.org" target="_blank): Help astronomers classify stars and galaxies. You might even be the first to discover something new.

[Common Voice:](https://voice.mozilla.org/en): Help inventors give their apps audible commands by donating your voice, anonymously, of course. A free voice database lets anyone improve their software.

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com): Stack Overflow lets programmers, engineers, customer support ask a question to colleagues. The person with the best answer gets rewarded. This kind of mass-collaboration will soon connect you with other people doing your frontline job.

[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/): Give yourself, or your kids, world-class education for free. You only need to login and start doing the work. Likewise, Udemy, Skillshare, The Great Courses all teach you programming, art design, photography, or anything else you need to know.

[Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/): You can fund your own levers of power. Kickstarter connects regular people trying to solve a problem, with ordinary people waiting for a solution. It only takes a few bucks to fund a product. The software of this website, Ghost Foundation, was started on Kickstarter.

Naysayers will point out problems here. They'll say Wikipedia has errors, or Kickstarter funds weird products. Ignore people who find a reason the future won't happen. I mean, compare some errors and delayed product releases, to Industrial Age industries that get billions in bail-outs every generation.

The mass-collaboration websites above are very young and inexpensive, yet they still put levers of power in your hand. As they improve, they will only increase your control over your slice of the world, which directly increases your political power.

Holding political power is what founded America, ended slavery, gave civil rights, and soon, will make player gods of the Internet Age.

## New and Old Societies As Seen in Celebrities

New technology is already changing our society. By connecting people to the internet, we've given ourselves the power to receive and send information on demand. Like a person holding a two-way radio in a life raft, we now have a voice.

An example of this freedom is celebrities. In the Industrial Age society, our stars were often decided for us. The era of mass-production only let a few people make movies, release albums, or get their names in "the papers."

Internet Age celebrities are different. While we can make fun of Instagram models, silly YouTubers, Twitter trolls, and obscure podcasts, but at least we can follow who we want. Which also means we celebrate who we wish to.

Heck, with no gates to overcome, anyone can be a musician, artist, comedian, thinker, reviewer, or "celebrity."

Personally, I follow people like Sailing La Vagabonde, Adam Savage's Tested, Kings and Generals, Historia Civilis, BatmanRealAccount, Dave 2D, Kirsten Dirksen, Traversy Media, Taylor Tries, RealEngineering, Dr. Becky. I celebrate them because they're real people doing cool stuff who'd never consider themselves celebrities.

The next time you hear "celebrity," ask yourself if they're one of yours. Modern technology gives you that power.

## Pandemic Test

Today we're counting on our local industries to make more medical masks, hand sanitizer and [quickly design, build, and distribute enough ventilators for our sick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vLPefHYWpY).

Our response to the coronavirus didn't need to be so uncertain. When a society is playing the game well, it has the resources, expertise, and drive to respond to any crisis.

For example, let's look at American during one of its biggest crises, World War II (1939-1945).

America didn't enter the war right away. In fact, several years into the conflict, the US still had a tiny military. But when Japan attacked in late 1941, and the Nazis declared war, the two "awoke a sleeping giant." This phrase describes America because it didn't matter the American military was small. Because her industrial base was extensive, her technical expertise was precise, and most importantly, her people were happy.

Led by industrialists [William S. Knudsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_S._Knudsen), and [Henry J. Kaiser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_J._Kaiser) (both had no formal education) America's "Victory" production program quickly outproduced everyone else. Even though Germany, Japan, and Italy were prepared for war, the American worker was twice as productive as a German, and four times more than a Japanese. The Ford Motor Company alone made more war equipment than all of Italy. General Motors manufactured even more, with the help of 16,000 suppliers, all in America.

The point is, America got into the war in late 1941, and it was all over within three and a half years. A big reason is the blazing speed America designed, built, and delivered new tanks, planes, and ships. More proof that the civilization that adapts the fastest wins.

And today, we're struggling to figure out where to get more face masks, hand sanitizers, and ventilators.

On the bright side, having our backs against the wall makes us adapt. Among the technical innovations, World War II is when America updated its culture. Finally, female and black Americans got to show their full potential in battle and assembly line.

It's no surprise the equality and civil rights movements upgraded our culture soon after the war was over. We can follow suit and start to remake our society during this pandemic by adopting a modern philosophy for the Internet Age.

_This photo was taken in 1943 in Pascagoula Mississipi. While most German and Japanese women were prohibited from working, America was adapting away from old traditions. It's no surprise which philosophy won. Credit: [National Archives Catalog](https://catalog.archives.gov/id/522890)_

## Linus T

People working well together is nothing new. Early America was blessed with communal barn-raising, quilting societies, and fraternal associations. They governed themselves in a Main Street economy. Open-source software and mass-collaboration simply adopt the same incentives. Because once our basic necessities are met, most people want to improve their craft, gain the respect of their peers, and pass-on their knowledge.

Open-source hero Linus Torvalds explained it by pointing out, "Money is not the greatest of motivators. Folks do their best work when they are driven by passion. When they are having fun. This is as true for playwrights and sculptors and entrepreneurs as it is for software engineers." Torvalds concludes, "What astonishes so many people is that the open-source model actually works."

With open-source, we have the technology to create our own levers of power to understand and enforce our warranty contracts, tax-laws, education systems, employment agreements, claim systems, and so on.

So, when the school board, doctor's office, the insurance company says, "fill in these forms," we should begin to say, "No, I want to use my open-source app. It let us both see timelines, appointments, and rules. If you don't want to use it, then I'll move my business. But if you do, I look forward to working with you."

## Intro


Talk to anyone on the frontline of today's pandemic and ask them if they feel ready. Face masks and disinfectants are already running low. More ventilators are needed, but no one knows where to get them. Patients show up, and no one knows where their medical records are. Even with so many bureaucrats and historical examples, no one was planning for a disaster.

I can sympathize. Whenever there is a bad storm, our car and property insurance claim departments scramble to keep up. Even though there's a big storm every few months.

As a result, long-time and loyal insurance customers can wait hours to speak with somebody and months to get their claim checks. During my time, I'd have to (somehow) explain to customers why the insurance company takes their money digitally but insists on paying claims with paper checks sent via snail mail.

It sucked trying to explain the nonsense. These customers paid their bills, and their claim was approved. Yet, they were like a ship-wrecked man on a beach, desperately waving at passing ships because he has no levers of power to wield.

There is no good reason why my customers had to wait. But like I said above, powerful managers and executives won't give regular people a fair deal if they don't have to.

![Git-Hub Rails](/assets/img-anp/github-repo-rails2.jpg)

_This is the [GitHub "repo" for Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails/graphs/contributors), the open-source technology that runs apps like Basecamp, Airbnb, and Shopify. Visit that page, and you'll see all the thousands of people who've helped make the core technology, even though most have never met each other. Mass-collaboration is this simple and effective. And, this priceless software required almost no garbage meetings. That's why you're job will soon use mass-collaboration too._

## Rome

For historical context, in 100 AD, the Roman Empire ruled over a third of the world's population. This era of "[Roman Peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Romana)" was a time of great prosperity not seen again until about 1700. Most outsiders dreamed about becoming Roman citizens.

And the Romans did all this with only several hundred state bureaucrats.

No kidding. Local communities, businesses, families mostly regulated their own lives with personal relationships. Not a direct comparison since our worlds are much different. But that should make you think. Meeting a Roman bureaucrat was like us meeting a physicist. They're out there when needed, but aren't relied upon up to live a daily life.

## Proof of Industrial Player Gods Dismantling

Social capital is measures how healthy a society's personal relationships, and its sense of identity is. Social capital is a form of capital that produces public goods for a common good. The more social capital, the more united the player god is around the ruling philosophy.

A classic example is people used to bowl in leagues. Now we increadingly "bowl alone."

And unsurpringly, America's social capital has be decline since entering the Internet Age. While "technology" like television and internet browsing is often blamed for people being more isolated, the real reason is that computers and the internet are used to  distract us from the fact our ruling philosophy needs to change.

You can tell by the huge rise in societys dark majic.

Since entering the Internet Age here are some stats.
Obestiy has doubled.


These are all examples of the social cohesion of the industrial age community falling apart because, well, we're not in the Industrial Age anymore.

## Proof of Industrial Player Gods Dismantling2

Financial capital measures how much money a person, company, or society has.

Political capital measures how much popular support a politican or movement has.

Less commonly known is "Social capital". This measures how healthy a society's personal relationships are. Do people have a sense of identity is? Do members of the society treat each other like they want to be treated?

The more social capital, the more united the player god is.

And our society has been losing social capital for decades. A classic example is people used to bowl in leagues. Now we increadingly "bowl alone."

## 576575

We have all incredible power at our fingertips, and we're letting bozo Left/Right political pundits tell us if climate change is real? We're stuck in two hours of traffic going to bullshit jobs because Michael Scott wants to have friends to boss around?

We're letting Darth Blockbuster tell us to... what? Follow rules that are hundreds of years old?

Then comes this pandemic. Our society is wondering how to make ventilators, face masks, and hand sanitizer? Like serious what the hell, why we're our factories packed up and sent to foreign lands? Who did this benefit?

Look at the video above; we can change our own world!

Pandemics, global warming, human migrations, widespread obesity, antisocial behavior, soaring national and personal debt, high divorce rates, traffic-filled roads, rising insurance rates, hopeless kids shooting up their own schools.

Our list of problems keeps growing because ordinary people aren't using the miraculous power of modern technology to evolve our civilization.

There's nothing rational or moral about staying an extra of the Industrial Age. A ruling philosophy is only worth following if it facilitates evolution; and Left/Right philosophies, and the era of mass-production, no longer do that.

## Mass Collaboration

As mentioned above, since digital property doesn't expire, and it can be shared with anyone in the world, all of us can stop competiting to mass-produce the same old products. Instead we can continually add to a single source of truth for anything can be digitized. From car designs, educational courses, to computer programs.

## Note to the Reader

I wanted to write a academic book on the history of philosophy. But that was taking too long, and as you'll find out in the book, I didn't get the evidence I needed to finish it anyway. So, I wrote this book to help people understand what's happening with our society today.

This version uses lots of videos and story references. Using familiar stories is a more natural way to explain philosophy, and politics, and I think makes points hit-home a little more. Using fiction makes things sound dramatic, so please don't let your imagination run away too much when reading this.

Don't worry. We can finish the Internet Age upgrade. Even now, during this pandemic, we can start to upgrade our way of life. People only need to believe in a new philosophy. One that teaches us how great the world will be when we finally control the Internet Age levers of power as player gods.

## New and Old Societies As Seen in Celebrities

New technology put two-way radios in all our hands. Like a person in a life raft, we now have a voice in our fates.

An example of this freedom is celebrities. In the Industrial Age society, our stars were often decided for us. The era of mass-production only let a few people make movies, release albums, or get their names in "the papers."

Internet Age celebrities are different. While we can make fun of Instagram models, silly YouTubers, Twitter trolls, and obscure podcasts, but at least we can follow who we want. Which also means we celebrate who we wish to.

I follow people like Sailing La Vagabonde, Historia Civilis, BatmanRealAccount, Dave 2D, Traversy Media, RealEngineering, and Dr. Becky. I celebrate them because they're real people doing cool stuff who'd never consider themselves celebrities.

The next time you hear "celebrity," ask yourself if they're one of yours. It can be anyone you want. Because modern technology gives you that power.

## What You Can Do Today

Writing a book is hard. One of the things that kept me motivated was realizing how many other people are working to build the Main Street economy. Some small examples are below.

[Galaxy Zoo](https://www.zooniverse.org"): Gives anyone the chance to classify stars and galaxies. You might even be the first to discover something new.

[Common Voice](https://voice.mozilla.org/en): Lets anyone donate their voice, anonymously, of course. Now even small companies can improve their software with audible commands.

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com): People can ask any question and get a reliable answer from an expert.

[Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/): Lets the people be their own investment group and fund their own products.

These sites aren't perfect, of course. But they're young, getting better every day, and quickly put the majical power of modern tools into the hands of the middle-class.

Add these communities to all the cooks in food trucks, making exciting food. Singer song-writers creating a new culture for us to enjoy. Podcasters interviewing experts and teaching us more about knitting, shipbuilding, or the immigrant mentality. Makers fabricating quality hand-tools we'd much rather repair than ever throw away.

Add these to the many other awesome workers hustling to make an honest living doing what they love, and you get the era of mass-collaboration.

To empower all these great people, even more, we need a new and improved rulebook.

## Bears Everywhere, Polar Bears Only In Some Places

I never wanted to write this book. Most of this book is based on combinining the lessons of evolutionary biology and political philosophy "How to See the Matrix".

I think they're the same field of study, so similar they suggest a supreme physical life field of some kind. That's the book I wanted to write. I used my take on political societies earned by using Aristotle's Poetics to better understand Hegelian Dialectics. It's work I did years ago. But it's original thinking will need the objective data from the Life Star to prove.

There's no way around the game of civilization. Like evolution to lifeforms, we all are inside it. It's paint by numbers. Tracks on the road. We all live and die under it's demands. Playing a Civilization computer game is really the best way to understand it. In the game, every player starts off small, then gathers resources, invests them smartly, and grows. Playing the game teaches the importance of geography, technological upgrades, adopting modern philosophies, defeating everyone who opposes you, investing in research and development, avoiding building palaces to host jewellery laden banquets and balls.

But no computer game forces the player into diversification or "adaptive radiation." In every game a player tries to take over the world with his one civilization. Never does the player have to segment himself into different civilizations. But, in natura this life-cycle of seed, growth, then adaption and diversificationns happens to all lifeforms and thus all civilizations.

Few people realize how human cyborgology is the same as biology.

Polar Bears are nearly identitical to Brown Bears. But they're polar for a good reason. If they didn't adapt to the cold, water, and food supply, they've never live in the Artic. Thus, life diversified them. Adaptation is why we can't send the suffering polar bears to the Amazon, or even Antartica. They are not adapted to the climate in one area, and the ecosystem in the other. Imagine penguins with a few antartic polar bears walking around. Happy feet indeed.

The point is this. We evolve just like any other lifeform. But we evolve with tools, and we evolve in ages. So we start off small, grow, and diversity in waves. Each new age, is like new lifeforms, new cyborgs, spreading across the world for the first time. Look at the European Powers below, who colonized the world a few generations ago during the Age of Discovery.

<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:44%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/eSItBDecz3oJy" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/maps-cartography-territories-eSItBDecz3oJy">via GIPHY</a></p>

The European Powers spread advanced civilization far and wide. Brutally in some cases—has anyone invented a way to spread new civilization or new lifeform easily? But that's the point. Evolution doesn't care about individuals. Survival of the best adaptation is Nature's rulebook.

So Trump and Brexit were inevitable. Our society wants to diversity after the Industrial Age. This is part of the game of civilization we all play, but few see the entireity of. That's why the established powers of the Industrial Age were so suprised, and have so much hatred, for nativist politics in the West. Although nativist politics isn't the future. Like the English Civil War, they're using old philosophies to try and make fundamental change. Only Techvolution, conscious adaptation using modern tools, is the new philosophy for our new Internet Age.

I plan to write a textbook on Techvolution (How to See the Matrix), I'll love to now delve more into the game of civilization for you., and teach you how to decode the trends of history: what a civil war is, how to predict a revolution, and so forth. The game defines our lives in so many ways, because it determines the roles we play in our lives. The accident of birth to parents, geography, or time-period makes us antagonists, protagonists, extras and player gods. Few people understand these roles. Once they can see it in the Life Star mirror, they'll be far more likely to choose Techvolution. But that'll come later. Hopefully.

## The End of One Game, and the Beginning of a New One

This section is my personal opinion, so take it for what it's worth to you.

The Western World is a made up term. Don't get me wrong, it's a good way to describe the shared culture of France, Britain, Holland, America, Austrialia and the other members of the political unit we call "The West". But if you look down at the globe, these landmasses wouldn't look united. The West is a human creation. There was no "Western Europe" in Roman times. The entire Mediterranean Sea and surrounding land was unified under the Roman Empire.

If the world had ended in 1900, The West would have won the game of civilization. Western Europe didn't have a head start. They didn't have any sort of advantage. If it's geography, resources, genes, or whatever were the reason for the West's rise to power, why did Rome fall. Why did Western Europe suffer so greatly in the Dark Ages if they had advantages available to no one else?

Western Europe conqured the world, because it used modern technology better than any other civilization. Their philosophy let them do that, and philosophy is a gift. It lets humanity invent and use new and better tools. Ancient Greece got it first, then it went to Rome, then to Middle East in the Islamic Golden Age, back to Italy in the Renaissance, where it spread to Western Civilization during the Science and Industrial Age, and thereafter to the world via European colonialization.

Playing Civilzation, Anno 1800, or any other game is a better education than the best schooling today. These games mimick real-life, and thus integrate so many lessons. They force players to think of the big picture that's so hard to appreciate in real-life. It's an invaluable perspective, especially to our society which is so obessed with itself, inside our spectacle, and art stories.

Our culture is very entrenched in the Industrial Age. But, we're in an entirely new age. The Internet Age is just as historical and powerful as the Science Age. And nobody has earned victory over it yet. Africa, South America, East Asia, Middle East, India, Eastern Europe, any civilization in the world is no better off then the West. Actually, I'd say, the West is far behind in the race to win the era of mass-collaboration.

In all my schooling, reading, discussing, working, in all my life, the ancestors of the barbarian kings, the ones whose grand parents worked 365 days a year in horrible English factories, who suffered famines in Ireland, draughts in France, and wars throughout Europe, the ones who worked the labs in New York, who worked the mines of Pennsylvania, the lines of Michigan, who solved millions of different problems during the Science and Industrial Ages as player gods; their descendents today simple don't want to feel frontline pain.

And without pain, these people fell no reason to update to the Internet Age. As one sharp observer noted to me, "it's like they've folded their cards."

Whichever society throws away the memories, excuses, and philosphies of the past, and embraces Techvolution and the era of mass-collaboration, will be the winner of the Internet Age. It's their player god who will happily reign supreme for many years in the never ending game of civilization. I smile, thinking of all those bakers, tailors, designers, roofers, engineers, cleaners, repairmen, and maybe even a few majicians, smiling on a new and empowered Main Street.

## Preview

Like mixed-martial arts and modern medicine, good stories also freely to mix and match tools.

For example, think of Cinderella locked inside that attic. The prince's men are so close, and if she can just get outside and try on the glass slipper her horrible life will change forever; if her friends can get the key.

Whatif they'd failed getting the key, and instead brough back a match?

Now the oppressed girl has some soul searching to do. The philsophy behind buring the house down, even to earn her freedom, is a different philosophy then getting some friends to steal a key.

The beauty of mixed-martial arts, modern medicine, and any field that selects its techniques, tools, applications based on the problem, is they are like a hero in a good story. Always free to use any tool to solve the problem at hand.

To recognize an ideologue and echo chamber, simply to ask their storytellers to change the tool. They won't be able to do it. They sell and earn their money, prestiage, on knowing a limited set of techniques and tools; be it government run social programs or corporate welfare. To let the problem determine the best solution is to threaten their self-image of being leaders.

Regardless. You can leave an echo chamber, by simply being a hero of your own story.

Be like Cinderella, decide to fight back agaisnt an injustice and find allies to help you seize the tools you need to change the world. 

## Data

Mr Data, what do your sensors indicate?

Nothing, sir.

Nothing?

Mister Data you must mean that it's empty of matter. There's always some energy form at work.

Sir our sensors are showing this to be absence of everything. It is a void without matter or energy of any kind.

Yet, this void has a form Data. It has height, width.

Perhaps. Perhaps not, sir.

That's hardly a scientific observation commander.

Caption, the most elementary and valuable statement in science, the beginning of wisdom is, "I do not know". I do not know what this is sir.

We're already discussed how each martial art has specific techniques. Boxing has punching, wrestling man-control, jiu-jitsu has submissions, and so on. Each of these techniques adapt the human body to perform a task. And in that way martial arts turn the human body into a different tool.

As we just learned, each tool has a philosophy behind it.

Boxing is about aggresive hitting, punching combinations, and footwork. Jiu-jitsu is about patience, planning, and seizing openings. Wrestling is hard training with endless reptitions. All sports techniques of their own philosophy. Yoga has a different philosophy than weight training. Ballet different than long distance running. These are the philsophies needed to harness the respective techniques of each sport.

## Echo Chambers Are Needed, Until They're Not

- Remember we're not erasing ideologies.

Before we learn to protect ourselves from the echo chambers, it's important to always keep in mind, we're not erasing ideologies. 

It would be nice if humanity created mixed-martial arts first. Spending hundreds of years developing many martial arts techniques where only a few ultimately proved effective seems like a waste. But starting off with mixed-martial arts wasn't possible.

We had to invent lots of options in order to select the best. Only ignorant people think great results don't require lots of wasted effort. Every hit product starts off with a poor first try. Every great book has thousands of erased pages.

By the same token, to invent martial art techniques needed lots of wasted effort. So while boxing alone isn't too effective againt a trained mixed-martial artist, for humanity to learn excellent punching techniques required we create boxing. Same applies to judo and its bodythrows, jiu-jitsu and its submissions, and so on for every discipline. Being stuck inside an echo chamber enforced by a strict rulebook allowed the practioners inside a martial art to iterate and perfect their selected techniques.

The obstacle mixed-martial arts had to overcome wasn't the rulebooks of martial arts disciplines, but their proclamations about being the single source of truth.

By thinking they had the monopoly on truth, old martial arts had the solution before hearing the problem. Such ignorance is sadly the drawback of having to grow disciplines inside of echo chambers. When those disciplines are exposed to competition, it's natural for those inside to advocate for their skillset. It's also natural to resist realizing those skills are outdated; starting all over is a hard reality for anyone to accept.

The achievement of mixed-martial arts is banishing ignorance from martial arts and replacing it with enlightenment. Anyone who chooses mixed-martial arts knows there are no easy answers because real fights have endless possibilities.

Thus, it's vital to remember there is nothing wrong with all but the extremist of today's ideologies. This book is not trying to erase your preferred ideology anymore than a mixed-martial artist wants to erase boxing. Every sub-culture has something to offer. But none can consider their techniques the single source of truth. Each ideology must be mixed and matched as needed by the problem being solved.

Some may be doubting our politics can follow martial arts and embrace mixed-ideological politics, here's another example of a field adopting a similarly enlighted philosophy.

Modern medicine has many disciplines and specialists. Some are based on cutting edge research, others on old school remedies. In the past, when isolated by geography and culture, people would be bound to do what the local healer or doctor prescribed. But today, you would never go to one medical professional, expecting them to be a master of every possible health problem.

There's simply too many human health problems for any one medical discipline to master.

That's why all medical professionals today, from hemopathic healers to neural surgeons, are recognized as sub-disciplines. Each has their own techniques, cultures, and rulebooks, and none say they are the single source of truth. The skill in modern medicine is mixing disciplines to solve a patients pain. While modern medicine certainly isn't perfect (especially its administration), compared to the past medicine filled with leeches, witchcraft, and one-size fits all solutions, its nearly magical. Modern medicine and mixed-martial arts are enlightened because they free their practioners minds to assess the problem before deciding on the best technique.

That book does the same for ideology.

If a person can train using different fighting techniques from many multiple martial arts disciplines, and doctors can refer their patients to specialists from other disciplines, why can't we also be self-aware enough, and respectful enough, to mix and match ideologies according to their strengths and weaknesses in solving a specific problem?

To enlighten our politics in such a way, we only have to accept no ideology is complete. Like in medicine or Ultimate Fighting, any ideological technique must be evaluated based on evidence of their real-world results and not ideological purity.

Ideological pundits, teachers, and commentators don't want the open competition of evolution. Like the stubborn martial artists who convined their students to never watch mixed-martial arts, ideologues today want to defend there skillsets from natural selection by keeping their echo chambers engaged with great (ideological) storytelling.

To escape their spell, we must understand the magic of storytelling.

---

Mixed-martial arts and modern medicine are enlightened because each embraces conclusions. If a Ultimate fighter loses several fights in a row, he will reevaluate his training, learn new skills, and perhaps change coaches. If a sick patient isn't getting better, she will assess her doctors and look for new remedies. Not every doctor or trainer practices these ethics of course, but those who don't are going against the grain because the culture of mixed-martial arts and modern medicine encourages patients and fighters to follow the evidence to find better solutions.

Because their fields are enlightened, mixed-martial artists and doctors can say "I don't know." None has to sell themselves as being the single source of truth.  Echo chambers can never say "I don't know." Doing so breaks the illustion and fractures the echo chamber.

>Not always, Scar. One day, it’ll be my son who rules. Simba will be your king.”
_Mufasa_ 

[_The Lion King_](https://www.quoteambition.com/the-lion-king-quotes/)

Most kids grow up watching movies. Fairytales like _Cinderella_, _Toy Story_, and the _Lion King_ fill up many childhood days. These are of course fairytales but they contain some truths about ourselves. We've discussed a few here.

Stories are about a hero working hard to solve a problem. Heroes have an insight that the prevailing philosophy is wrong. When working to change it, an antagonist defends the current way of life. They two sides find allies to help them seize levers of power. The winner gets to remake, or reaffirm, the world in their image.

_The Lion King_ follows this mold. Mufasa is the head of a pride of lions. He teaches his son Simba the wisdom needed to be a leader, much to the chagrin of Scar, Mufasa's conniving brother. Scar responds by murdering Mufasa and framing Simba, who flees in shame. Scar doesn't turn out to be a wise leader. He overhunts the land and causes hunger and despair among the pride. Simba eventually lion's up and returns to reclaim his land and pride. After a climatic battle, he kills scar, and reclaims his birthright as the lion king.

The Lion King is a good story. As we learned above, humans love stories. It's how we make sense of the world and pass-on our knowledge.

Yet, that is also our problem. We can understand cause and effect so easily that stories come naturally to us. But that doesn't mean we're good at reasoning which stories are real or fake. We can just as easily believe in a false story. Because no other animal could make any sense  of the lion king.

Birthright? Being born into nobility. Holding it against a lion for trying to be head of a pride so he can procreate? Birthrights don't exist in nature. No adaption can expect to be handed anything. Everyday is a race. And everyone, except worker terminates, bees and ants, are expected to do everything possible to procreate.

So, why does the Lion King resignate on us it makes no sense to the rest of the animal kingdom?

The whole trick of evolution is finding the perfect adaptation. And no one can predict what that is. You just must respond to failure with another adaption as quickly as possible. The rest, like caring about gender, is all noise.

The Boston Symphony had a problem. There was a lot of men in their ranks. That wasn't the problem though. The problem was they didn't know why. There were plenty of talented female musicians auditioning, yet not many were making the cut.

You might be thinking, make the audition blind. But it already was, no judge could see the musicians perform. Now you might be thinking, well, I guess that's it, the males were just better.

Instead of accepting that observation, the symphony tried something else. The judges asked the musicians to take their shoes off before walking to the audition stage. Now the judges couldn't see them, nor hear their shoes.

And within a few years, the symphony was about equal men and women.

The sounds of the shoes was triggering a bias in the both male and female judges. By removing everything but the music, they heard only the music, and got a better product for their audiences.

That's a good little story. As we learned above, humans love stories. It's how we make sense of the world and pass-on our knowledge.

Yet, that is also our problem. We can understand cause and effect so easily that stories come naturally to us. But that doesn't mean we're good at reasoning which stories are real or fake. We can just as easily believe in a false story, as did the judges who heard footsteps instead of music.

The whole trick of evolution is finding the perfect adaptation. And no one can predict what that is. You just must respond to failure with another adaption as quickly as possible. The rest, like caring about gender, is all noise.

Yet, think of this. In all the world's ecosystems, no two species speaks the same language, yet everyone works together to keep Life alive. Bees and fruit trees don't talk, yet together they arrange the time to flower and harvest the pollen....

Species communicate not with words, but with tools and products. Things that each can make that help the other harness resources better. When Cinderella was locked in the attic, she didn't need to tell her friends what she needed, but her problem defined her solution; ie. the key to the door.

But, what if you can't make a helpful product? In nature, species who can't cut it are automatically erased from the list of competitors. But no so in humans. The victors of the last race aren't (yet) required to re-run it again the next time. Instead, they can turn humans ability to reason against us, but telling a story of The Lion King.

That's why we need mixed-ideological politics.

---

And we change our psychology by learning new things, which often times, means hearing and believing in a story. A few thousand people surfed in 1958. After a movie called _Gidgit_ was released, there were millions of people riding the waves. When _Jaws_ was released, most everyone started to fear shark attacks. Today millions of people buy iPhones, watch shows, change their political opinions because stories transmit information so easily we are often at a storytellers mercy.

---

The Cambrian explosion was about 538.8 million years ago when practically all major animal linakges started appearing in the fossil record. It resulted in the divergence of most modern metazoan phyla. The event was accompanied by major diversification in other groups of organisms as well.

Before early Cambrian diversification, most organisms were relatively simple, composed of individual cells, or small multicellular organisms, occasionally organized into colonies. As the rate of diversification subsequently accelerated, the variety of life became much more complex, and began to resemble that of today.

---

Biological lifeforms grow up once, and are bound to the adaptations, instincts, and environment they're given. We likewise grow up and learn the tools, culture, rules, which, like it did for Cinderella, create the role we're supposed to play in our society.

By questioning the stories that connect us to tools, we're ripping the away the mask of all we've learned, and starting over. We're debasing ourselves and thereby starting a new race of evolution with no guarantees and lots of opposition. It's not natural for lifeforms to drop their adapatations and lifestyle in the hope we can re-write our future; which is why we cherish heroes like Cinderella so much.

The abused maid could have just stayed home, as kickboxers could have avoided mixed-martial arts, or doctor's could pretend they have all the answers.

Instead, they each choose to embrace uncertainity by droppping what they know and find better tools and answers to solve their problems. The philosophy they each believe in says to choose evolution.

---

To showcase how tools determine one's philosophy, think of Cinderella locked inside the dusty and cramped attic. The Prince's men are looking for her and if she can try on the slipper, her horrible life will change forever. So, what if her friends failed getting the key, but did get her a match?

Now the oppressed girl has some soul searching to do. Lighting a fire could get the Prince's mens attention, but the philsophy of possibly buring the house down, and killing herself and others, even to earn her freedom, is a different philosophy then getting some friends to steal a key to open a door.

The effects our tools have in the world determines what we truly believe in. 

---

If you're content with the political atmosphere today and enjoy being a Conservative or Progressive (or more likely being anti-Conservative or anti-Progressive), then don't this book. You're not going to find any ammunication to use against our enemy.

We're here to rise the hate and improve our politics.

When someone is telling you a story, and the hero and villian, and their philosophies, never go into the sunset, you're being sold an echo chamber. You are being told a unnatural story because there is no conclusion; just endless pages waiting to be filled with your time and money.

Echo chambers don't like conclusions because they force an assessment on whether the hero, his philosophy, and his chosen tools changed the world or not. Only when a "mix and match" philosophy like mixed-martial arts, modern medicine, and scientss has in in force are sub-disciplines free to embrace conclusions because they aren't pretending to be the single source of truth.

Because we don't have mixed-ideological politics, today's ideologues can't embrace conclusions. Instead they must form echo chambers selling their chosen tools and techniques as perfect, while slandering the competition, because Conservatives and Progressives are locked in a winner take all battle.

Before Ultimate Fighting, all fighters were puting the horse before the cart, so to speak. They had the answers before knowing the problem because as students they were used to thinking fights are won or lost according to man-made rules governeed by teachers, pundits, and judges.

>_I think one of the things that really separates us from the high primates is that we’re tool builders. I read a study that measured the efficiency of locomotion for various species on the planet. The condor used the least energy to move a kilometer. And, humans came in with a rather unimpressive showing, about a third of the way down the list. It was not too proud a showing for the crown of creation. So, that didn’t look so good. But, then somebody at Scientific American had the insight to test the efficiency of locomotion for a man on a bicycle. And, a man on a bicycle, a human on a bicycle, blew the condor away, completely off the top of the charts._

When you think of our body politic as full of organs, ideological preferences make much more sense. All species agree that it's best to not have to evolve because re-inventing adaptations is risky. Conservatives are supposed to generate wealth, so they want machines, labour, energy, and taxes as cheap as possible to make their existing techniques and tools relevant for longer. While Progressives want easier wealth distribution via complex regulation, higher taxes, subsidized services, and free healthcare because they control these adaptations. Like old martial art teachers, ideologues _may_ have the best solutions for you, but they always sell their solutions before knowing what fight you're in because evolution is full of failure.

To get there all we must do is let evolution free.

 - No technology survives forever.
 - All technology has a common ancestry. 
 - Evolution of new tools is gradual.
 - The number of tools must always multiplies to fill niches.
 - Natural selection by on the frontline of evolution must freely determine which tools lives on.

----

- pain is still life's way to communicate change needed, but we must have a free innovation to sovle it to have evolution.
- Tools effectual lifecycle is the ride we're on, especially because echo chambers sustain non-functionality.
- only end users on the frontline (fightters, patients, Cinderella) feel pain, and have a valid say in the adoption of new tools. Everyone else is but a teacher/manager/coach/stepmother who has all the incentive in the world to tell stories why evolution is bad.

- NOBODY KNOWS. WHAT DOES MICHAEL SCOTT DO. 
- IT'S THE END OF THE STORY. THERE ARE NO MORE HEREOES, NO MORE VILLIANS.

 - No technology survives forever, but the Industrial Age powerbrokers want there's it to.
 - All technology has a common ancestry.
 - Evolution of new tools is gradual.
 - The number of tools always multiplies to fill niches. Mass production and mass society prvents this.
 - Natural selection determines which tools lives on. There are no human referres or middlemen. There can be natural selection unless the people using a tool are free to decide to keep using it, or choose another.



 - the oft said "i want to decentralize power" is the required evolutionary step of speciation.
 - queen ball, bees kill their queen when non-functioning

- mammal/bird parents pass-on knowledge.
  - we can't learn from parents as we're in a new age.
  - new age equals new frontier.
  - Mayr 253.
- Large populations are inert and don't evolve fast.
  - Founder populations face more selective pressure b/c environment is novel, thus evolve faster.
  - Mayr 193.
- Founder vs Corps.
  - Established species have a large and therefore inert gene pool that washes away new genes.
  - Founding pops have limited gene pools, more likely to absorb new genes and phenotypes.
  - Mayr 135.
- The General Rule of Speciation
  - No strict rule or formula to achieve speciation.
  - General rule, "The less gene flow there is between populations, the more rapidly speciation will occur, all else being equal"
  - Ie. local need solved by local greed, and vice versa.
  - Mayr 186.
- Components of evolution
  - Darwinian evolution is a byproduct of two divergent forces, chance (involuntary mutation) and neccesity (surviving the selection process). Mayr 229.
  "No individual is ever perfectly adapted...the main reason for this is perhaps that every genotype represents a compromise of genetic variability and stability." Mayr 145.
  - Two halves of our social society, creation and generation, both are going overboard with their art/spectacle, and the result is loss of function/evolution.

>"The history of evolution is a steady extinction of species and the origin of new species. Thus turnover is often apparently due to the superiority of a new species over an established species." Mayr 132.
