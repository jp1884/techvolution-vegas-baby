# Magic Connections Make Stories

First dates are amazing. Even the generic dinner and movie ones are wondrous. Sitting there in your nice sweater, eating a medium steak, sipping water, and across from you is a stem-cell. What the fuck? Yep. Stem-cell. She, (or he), could be your Juliette. This moment might start a story where in a few days, you might pay your soul to prevent even a frown on this stranger's heavenly face. Such is the power of romances.

Or this moment might end with a five year divorce with true accusations of infidelity where you eat beans for breakfast, bitters for lunch and dinner, and see your kids once a week. Your own offspring thinking you're a stranger because of this demon. Such is the power of tragedies.

In truth, most stories are somewhere in between two extremes; but that's beside the point. The point is every story starts with a connection. If human life is a tapestry of stories, both grand and small, we have to understand how we make and keep people connected to their stories.

It's question of reason. A connection is made when a story is on the borderline. One that is unexpected enough to be interesting, yet reasonable enough to be understood. People, viewers, readers, don't have to be conscious of every element. A good story takes a person over. That's why we often loose ourselves to the romance or the tragies.

So to get someone connected to a story, we must make them happy. Easy enough. Everyone likes happiness.

That's easy to know, hard to achieve. Your Juliette could think your a loser. Your Romeo might be ignoring your text messages. The point is we can't make happiness, we can't force a connection. Happiness is a magical connection between you, and a person, product, achievement, leader, or society, that forces a person to stay inside a story.

Happy stories are magical. So the question is, are you happy with yours?

## It's Not Changing

You read about King Charles I. The king who died rather than apologize. We're using King Charles to showcase how nobles couldn't understand any objections to their rule because they didn't understand their role in the story of life has a natural conclusion.

Meaning, once peace and security returned to western Europe, the nobility's storyline ended. Thus, the nobility should have proactively done what Rousseau said, and return to being equal members of society. They didn't of course. And history used many violent revolutions to right that wrong.

Charles had a speech impediment. Often called a stammer or studder. No one then, or even now, understands what causes it. It's like a gremlin holding an electrical cord connecting your thoughts and your tongue; sometimes the electricity flows, and sometimes it doesn't. In practice this means some words are easy to say, some are hard, and some decide which at the last millisecond. Smooth talking requires agility as the speaker has to manuever around this path of uncertainty.

Hello, my ~~name~~ I go by John-ne. I wa-want to help ~~master~~ destroy revolutions. I've been ~~writ~~ trying to write this book for ~~about~~ a ~~year~~ six months...

The prospect of talking, accept to yourself and your dog, causes huge anxiety as you can imagine.

I know this because luckily enough (kidding) I have the same affliction as King Charles. Ironically it was the reason I got a job in a car insurance claim department. After a Vice President at an old company secretly told my supervisor I wasn't allowed to talk to customers, for fear of embarrasing the company, I was like shit I guess I don't have this damn thing under control.

I wasn't even that mad about it (although I was that they were not upfront). I never told anyone I had the impediment, so it obviously was an problem.

So fuck it. Jump into the deep end and sick or swim. Car insurance claim call-centre was like the Olympic trails for a stutterer, so I jumped in. Huge emotions, all day phone calls, customer service expectations, no "outs" like swear words or wonky behavior to hide behind.

And it was far worse then I thought. The company would ring a "bell" all day because... I don't know, to de-sensitize us to customers pleas for more money, or to bully us. Either way, DING-DING-DING-DING all day. No apps. No machine learning. No ideas but a motherfucking bell that gave people who weren't stutteres huge anxiety, breakdowns, and sick leaves. We were bullied in other ways, but the worst was only being given given fax machines, email, and voicemail to coordinate 200 plus car accident files at the same time.

Shock speech therapy!  After about a year I didn't have to massage my jaw at night, to release it from all the jaw-clenches I did to divert vocal stuttering. I was cured!

The point is this. That's what I took for me to mostly now, never really stutter. It's like night and day. A hidden personality was fostered and frankly is fun to be. Yet Charles never had this lesson. He was famoulsy shy, quiet, and anxious because that's the personality _it_ superimposes onto you. Even when fighting 10 years of war Charles still probably had to massage his strained jaws after work every night.

Yet, when on trial for his life, Charles did not stutter. Oliver Cromwell, a Napoleon like figure except he was a religious puritan, led the trial against Charles for "crimes against the English people". Cromwell said the nobles didn't have a "divine right to rule". Charles wasn't pretending to not understand. He wasn't proud, or stubborn. He pyschologically couldn't understand. He was so sure of himself, he bypassed the gremlin spoke in such elegant words many people were impressed.

Charles spoke clearly because he believed in something. He was wrong, dead wrong. Pun intended. His and his peers ignorance caused so much destruction we'll be studying it for centuries. Yet he still believed in making a better society. He died believing in it.

## It's Your Story, What Do You Think

And now we get to you. The reader. The person inside the woven tapestry of technological creation. The grand story of our ancestors was taming security by making nobility divine; ours has been taming poverty by making private property divine, and your individual life is somewhere inside there. Remember while it's okay to be little confused by a story while you're watching it, we also must understand its reason when looking back at it.

Looking back at your day, year, life, do you see the reason inside the story of your life? To have a techvolution means we have to understand the ruling philosophy, and the technological development that will someday discredit that philosophy. Defining our ruling philsophy is easy enough. Knowing when our woven tapestry of technological development discredits our ruling philosophy is easy in retrospect. Yet what about when we are inside the story right now.

Good thing we can feel the answer. It's the same feel that the people had when they sang:

>When the beating of your heart
Echo’s the beating of the drums
There is a life about to start
When tomorrow comes!

Our ancestors felt their ruling philosophy had to go. They felt it in their lives because they could not see the reason inside their own stories anymore. The could fell they had to jump to a new story. A new chapter in the story of humanity where people live free, but work together to conquer poverty. We know now that technology had disabled the need for political nobility. Yet for them, they could just feel the lure of freedom and could do nothing but fight for it.

What about you now, in your life. Is it obvious to you, as a character in the story, why you live the life you do. Let's find out how can you might tell.

Your spend most of your life going to, sitting at your place of work. When you're there, do you feel like you're helping society?  Do you see the reason for spending your life at work?  Or do you see chains keeping you from a better life. That question started the French Revolution. And now you need to answer it before we have our own.

## Think Carefully

When you're asked are you happy, please don't think things will change or get better. No matter what happens, today's nobility will not change themselves. You can try to sell modern technology to a old bureaucracy or corporation to see it. But here's a easier, and more drastic way to tell just how convinced we all get into our stories.

You read about King Charles I. The king who died rather than apologize. We're using King Charles to showcase how nobles couldn't understand any objections to their rule because they didn't understand their role in the story of life had a natural conclusion. 

Meaning, once peace and security returned to western Europe, the nobility's storyline ended. Thus, the nobility should have proactively done what Rousseau said, and return to being equal members of society. They didn't of course. And history used many violent revolutions to right that wrong.

The prospect of talking, accept to yourself and a dog, causes huge anxiety as you can imagine. _The King's Speech_ show it all well enough.

I know this because luckily enough (kidding) I have the same affliction as King Charles. Ironically it was the reason I got a job in a car insurance claim department. After a Vice President at an old company secretly told my supervisor I wasn't allowed to talk to customers, for fear of embarrasing the company, I was like shit I guess I don't have this damn thing under control. I wasn't even that mad about it (although I was that they were not upfront). I never told anyone I had the impediment, so it obviously was an problem.

The point is this. That's what I took for me to mostly now, never really stutter. It's like night and day. A hidden personality was fostered and frankly is fun to be. Yet Charles never had this lesson. He was famoulsy shy, quiet, and anxious his whole life because that's the personality _it_ superimposes onto you. Even when fighting 10 years of war Charles still probably had to massage his strained jaws after work every night.

Yet, when on trial for his life, Charles did not stutter. Oliver Cromwell, a Napoleon like figure except he was a religious puritan, led the trial against Charles for "crimes against the English people". Cromwell said the nobles didn't have a "divine right to rule". Charles wasn't pretending to not understand. He wasn't proud, or stubborn. He pyschologically couldn't understand. He was so sure of himself, he bypassed the gremlin spoke in such elegant words many people, even those who hated him, were impressed.

Charles spoke clearly because he believed in something. He was wrong, dead wrong. Pun intended. His and his peers ignorance caused so much destruction we'll be studying it for centuries. Yet he still believed in making a better society. He died believing in it while speaking his last words without a hint of a stutter.

So when you answer the question, are you happy today, imagine yourself, and your kids, living like today for the rest of their lives. Otherwise, the ruling philosophy will never change until one day, we hit a revolution.

This liberal philosophy of individuality is promoted and defended in all our institutions. Classrooms teach an individual's human and property rights are hallowed. Boardrooms figure out how to indulge our wants with products like faster cars or bigger homes. News broadcasters tell us how good the economy is when we all indulge. They even have benchmarks like Gross Domestic Product and stock prices. Progressives vigoursly fight for individual rights like marriage or minority rights. Conservatives do the same thing for property and gun rights. And many of the stories we watch promote all this individuality. When was the last time you saw a story about political compromise, or what would happen if America restarted the military draft, or the self-sacrifice of a gay man staying in the closet to keep his family together.

I like to think Western Rome, after starting it's story in 8th Century BC, was just tired. It had gone through so many different ruling philosophies, first with kings, then republics with consuls, senates, and tribues, then back to viritual kings called emperors. Rome warred constantly, with themselves in dozens of civil wars, and with countless tribes and empires. They integrated countless people's and beliefs into their ruling philosophy. Rome went from their own pagan religion, to adopting the Greek mythology, to changing their founding story to be the Trojans, before adopting a pacifist cult called Christianity as a state religion.

They did all this while building a civilization we still envy today. Rome's cities, agriculture, commerce, aquaducts, buildings, literature, military, and politics still give us many lessons. Alas, it was a series of grand stories from Romulus, Pompey Magnus, Julius Caesar, Cleopatra, and Jesus Christ, to so many more.

Maybe Rome just wanted a conclusion. After nearly 1,500 years of working at it, there was no more ways to adapt its ruling philosophy again, and motivate its characters to act inside yet another grand story. I personal get the sense that if they'd discovered more of the world, they might have been excited by the adventure of exploring it. But as it was, Rome's story had been in the same setting for thousands of years. What other story was there to live? And so the Roman people/characters slowly didn't bother, and let backward barbarians take over. This is only an impression of mine. Rome needed the New World, like we need Mars.

Our real life stories are very confusing. We're often like Sophie not sure which what is right or wrong. Is humanity naturally good, but corrupted by society. Or is humanity naturally corrupted and saved by society. That question, in many variations, consumes lots of thinking

I think the answer is how we solve problems. We only ever solve a problem with technology. A story about being lost, oppressed, and hungry, is only solved with technologies like compasses, reading, and farming. I use technology as a catchall term for any tool, be it material like a bucket, structural like a building, or biological like a hand, or mental like reading, that life uses to solve a problem.

Life makes us solve problems as it fights off death. And to solve problems we invent technology. Everytime we overcome a problem with technology, life wins. My problem is how do we learn to master revolutions. and for that i want to tell you a story.

And this is the story of humanity, and of this book. How do we spread technology, and learn...

Need to factor in revolutions...

That's the power of stories. No matter their size, they can change the world by giving us information in a easy to understand way. A story is a person solving a problem through a series of events that are ordered into a beginning, middle, and end. We always know what's happening and why. That's why we kids to seniors love stories. It's a way to get, and give, knowledge.

Naturally good if free from calamity. Or bad, as the husband showed. Ruling philosophy doesn't help.

First let's look at the lessons. Unless we're facing starvation, or some calamity, many people will be good like Sophie was. Life wants us to help each other, because that only helps life survive. Yet, freedom can't alway be good. The husband was free and he used it to enslave others.

The ruling philosophy is no help either. Most people will follow the rules with the rest of the crowd. While dissenters will often dissent for the sack of it. Thus, during a person's life, there's still no way to know if following or dissenting, is good or evil.

Plots don't help. If you told this story in the Southern States, in 1842, Sophie would have been a bad person turned good. If you told it in England, she'd be a good person turned bad.

Inside the stories of our lives, we thus can't always trust our personal instincts, the instincts of society, or the events of our lives, to tell us what's good or evil. This confusion makes it easy to believe good and evil doesn't even exist. Or to constantly be surprised.

Image yourself Sophie, following Frederick as grew to worldwide fame. She went from being good and evil, several times as America kept changing it's definitions. What was she, as a honest person trying to be good, to do? People are often left adrift looking for answers.

Gladly, life is a grand story with certainty. Life knows what's good and evil. Life is good, death is evil. To fight against death, life can't rely on characters, or plots, because both have no inherent goodness. So how does life free us to our natural goodness, without the assholes messing it up?

Sophie may not have always been good. She didn't dissent when she should have. But she still _did_ good when she taught Frederick to read. And that's life answer to the uncertainty of good and bad inside characters and plots.

Technology is always good.

Many people were made slaves because of words. Many people make themselves slaves with the words they read.
Nobody was ever made free with ignorance. Technology is the manifestation of life inside a lifeform, or object used to help life survive death.

And this is the story of humanity, and of this book. How do we spread technology, and learn...

Need to factor in revolutions...

Douglass relatively liked living in Sophie's house. He didn't want to go back to the Maryland farm. And he feared going to the huge plantations in the Deep South. Why? He was owned under contract of property in all three areas. Why did slavery have levels of evil? Proximity. Living with people, working in small farms, and slaving away in huge plantations meant owner and slave experience each other differently. Proximity to evil, meant more interactions to force out the good. Thus, even though the ruling story of every area allowed slavery, life broke through the closer two people actually touched. This is why uneducated outsiders like Sophie, and young kids, taught Frederick to read.

Now who do you think the people who farmed your coffee, made your fancy car would think is the protagonist and antagonist? Do you appreciate the extra effort making another disposal cup, or adding leather to a steering wheel as if the person was right beside you?

Fine, it's not your fault the global supply chain is fucked up. You probably own stock in some of the large companies, but I'll concede most people don't want to be Darth Vader. That's why we buy fair trade coffee, and drive electric cars.

What about your workplace. Do you think the future you, reading this in Star Trek, will envy your 9-5, with an hour drive in good weather, dealing with asshole customers, paying for a house you can't afford, working for one of our many Blockbusters with unknown bosses who can't even play a DVD. Try and better yourself like Douglass did, make an app, and see how the bosses at Blockbuster respond.

You can't say the past is evil, while being like Sophie and accepting the present ruling philosophy is good. The ruling philosophy, the definitions of good and evil inside our society, are not dependable. They change inside every microstory. Some are better then others for sure. But life doesn't work it's magic there. Life always needs to fight evil. So this is how it always does.

## Catch and Release

One day, many workers from another department were asked to visit a hotel. Hundreds of people filtered in, and were directed to the conference room. Actually two conference rooms; either #101 or #102. Each room had water bottles and snacks. Yet why two rooms? Friends in each were texting back and forth, comparing, trying to spot the differences that might reveal the reason for their divide.

About 45 minutes later, Human Resources representatives appear. One group in each room. One says "you all have jobs", while the other says "as we all know, technology is advancing greatly, and this inevitably means automating lots of jobs. Like Netflix, we all love Netflix don't we, well unfortunately...". A mass firing of front-line workers.

It hit so hard, we adjusters felt it. Especially since it kept happening. The supervisors felt the bern. The SNAP-SNAP-SNAP-SNAP got a little faster. Everyone got extra hooked on being sure they'd pay the rent.

===

## Skywalker Prologuee

Seriously. Let me explain. Life needs us to fight off death by solving problems like disease, hunger, ignorance, and barbarism. Life gets what it needs, by making us live stories; because stories are about a hero character (you) solving a problem through a series of events inside of a plot. Each story has a protagonist, and antagoninst, Luke Skywalker, and Darth Vader, battling for their version of good, against the other side's evil.

When _we_ write the story, it's easy to know which side is which; that Skywalker is the hero, and Darth Vader and his Death Star space station are evil. Imagine if _Star Wars_ showed the families of the "bad guys" on the Death Star that Luke Skywalker blows up. Millions of families suffered so many hooks, yet the audience celebrates because a few thousand rebel "heroes" were saved. Because we humans wrote the story, we can slant it that way.

Yet in real life, we are not writers. We can't control anything but our characters. We can define evil within our own micro-stories. But to answer the general question "what is evil" is impossible because in the grand story of life, all of it, we're always just a character living micro-stories.

With so many lifeforms, living so many stories, who's to say what's best for life? Maybe we can collect many stories into a decent definition of "good and evil", yet no human written story like a religion or ideology will capture all of life's good and evils. There's too many contractions. It would be like Luke Skywalker commenting on a romantic comedy, mystery murder, and a coming of age movie, and expecting to be the hero in all stories. Skywalker is only the hero in _Star Wars_. Maybe he's a jerk boyfriend, or bad witness, cheated on his school exams, or just an extra.

===

## Hooks

Writers call your first impression on a story, "the hook". If it's memorable it's called the hook. If it sucks it's called forgotten. When I got a new job answering phone calls and processing car insurance claims for people, it sucked. But a job's a job, and I was hooked on paying the rent.

People has a double meaning. People, as in the people who paid thousands of dollars in case they needed much more after a car crash. And people, as in the corporation that took the people's money, promising to return it if needed. My job was claims adjuster, a sort of guardian of the people's money. You talk with customers, get their accident details, verify their account is active, get repair estimates, and send the check. The job was kinda like a bank teller, or Blockbuster rep; mostly talking with customers, doing paperwork, managing long queues, and working business hours. The job of adjusting hadn't changed much since the 1980's.

One constant hiccup was getting the details. People don't call claim departments with happy stories; it's often ones filled with hooks about crashes, robberies, and broken bodies. One day a coworker answered a call; car crash, followed by a car fire. The customer was stuck inside. Double hook.

His wife Jane Doe called in, with no idea what... what... what does anything mean anymore. Unlike 911 calls, people aren't frantic. They've had time to consider everything. They need guidance to understand so many hooks. Often adjusters were just shoulders. Adjusters quickly learn to throw away the mandatory talking points and just talk like a real person.

With 40 phone calls a day, dozens of faxes and emails, we processed hundreds of claims a week. You get used to the complaints about long hold times, or high insurance rates, but evil stories hook you too. So when our coworker was done with the call, we all looked at her with empathy. Now she needed someone else to take the hook off her shoulders, and...

BEEP!... BEEP!... BEEP!... BEEP!... BEEP!... The supervisor was ringing his bell, what he used to tell us "get back to work, answer more phone calls!". Lots of customers were waiting. The insurance company sells a contract. It's the front-line workers, adjusters, job to be the ones to honour that contract, and deal with whatever hooks we get. We just had to hurry up about it, and answer more phone calls, send more faxes. Like Blockbuster, we had to be sure customers could access their DVD's when we wanted them to.

## Wikipedia

Wikipedia lets anyone start and edit an article. You know about Galileo using his telescope to change the world, contribute what you know. Because Wikipedia's software tracks every change, graffiti is erased faster than vandals can make it. The result is an ever growing "the sum of all human knowledge." In a common trend of the internet, technology now lets millions of the people contribute small bits of work, to make a massive whole. Linux, Andriod, Firefox, Ruby on Rails, Deno, Wikipedia, and so much other cool stuff is made by faceless people, avilable for free, because so many people are hooked on being a protagonists contributing to a good cause.

Of course this is in contrast to Blockbuster. The DVD is a one way street. It makes people extras, having to pay, and be regulated, by the gatekeepers we called Blockbuster. Wikipedia is a two street. It fosters collaboration.

But who should be allowed to make a Wikipedia entry? I think everyone but short people. They usually have chips on their shoulders. Which is ironic because they're so close to the ground. If you defend them, remember Wikipedia is the "sum of all human knowledge", how much can short people really add?

This may seem ridicules, but a generation ago, contributing what you knew wasn't done in a click. It was years of trials before esteemed judges with long names like Distinguished Chair of Knowledge, Professor Emeritus George Doe of The University of Loans. The sum of all human knowledge was held behind walls at Blockbuster, called Enclyopia Britannica, or Oxford Dictionary. Only university graduates would be approved to work there. The poor, minorities, unlucky, sick, or maybe even short people could be easily excluded. After all, the institutions made their own rules. They had their own BEEP! with due dates, required readings, and fierce competition to rise into the hierarchy of esteem.

Wikipedia's first version was supposed to mobilize these experts. It was called Nupedia and had all the features of Wikipedia. In it's first year Wikipedia had forty thousand articles. Nupedia 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11...12.

Thousands of universities, professors, students, spending hundreds of millions dollars had the opportunity to give the world their knowledge, and they didn't. I was at an "elite university" then, studying the history and political philosophy of technological changes. The greatest lesson I got was seeing Wikipedia openly mocked for not being elitist. Professors were like the priests who rejected Galileo _because_ his telescope made knowledge easier to understand.

Blockbuster vs. Netflix. Universities vs Wikipedia. Taxis vs Uber. Hotels vs AirBnB. Insurance companies vs. Somebody Soon. There is something else going on. Every new transformative technology has a antagonist. Why are new and better technologies getting attacked. Professors, business owners, priests, managers, are hooked to using old technology, yet masked it with prestige built up from being gatekeepers. Protagonists, antagonists, battling for control of the grandstory of our civilizations.

And the extras stuck in the middle trying to pick a side.

## Who Are The People

Wikipedia isn't perfect. But when a person wants to learn something, Wikipedia, or Khan Academy, Udemy, or YouTube, is very likely good enough. They're usually almost free. We can pick what we need to know. And our success depends on learning the solution to the problem that had us looking for help. No grades, no admissions test.

In contrasts, universities, while still doing some really good work, are so much like Blockbuster. Needed and used until better technology like Wikipedia or Netflix comes along.

The point is, have we learned that lesson. I mean, if you write, edit, curate 20 Wikipedia articles, that are read by millions of people, is there even a word for that like "university gradute"? Will you get a job because of your contribution?

Anonymous contributions worked good enough Wikiepdia. It's worked in other places in society. Anyone can upload a YouTube video, make something for sale on Etsy, upload computer software to GitHub. Services like Uber, and AirBnB now help people get paid for using their own property differently. We're empowering anyone to be protagonist with modern technology and contribute what they can. Or are we?

Because whilst at work, I got sick of all those hooks, and all those BEEPS!. So I had an edit to make, and how many people know about car claims adjusting. So why not contribute an upgrade.

So, what if we didn't pretend it was 1980's anymore? Maybe we could make the claims department work faster, and thereby help everyone. My contribution was suggesting we stopped using fax machines. Because thousands of times a week we faxed documents to other insurance companies. Why not go online?

The answer from the experts was the same as Nupedia, Blockbuster, a definitive no. Actually it wasn't a no. It was a review process that never ended. An unconscious allergy to new technology, hidden behind the prestige of old technology.

## Your Hook Into Wikipedia

And this is where you and I, as members of the same society, have a hook inside the same story. What happens next? I have this helpful contribution, that maybe a thousand adjusters would use. But it would help hundreds of thousands of drivers after a crash.

Yet that edit could't be made. It was refused by the experts. I'm not here to argue about my job. You ever use a fax machine 10 times a day? That says enough. The outrage is realixing how often this shit is  happening.

Inside our economy we're called customers and workers. We're told to be extras each time, there to service the. But really we're collaboraters. I, the adjuster, and talking with Jane Doe after her husband died. She needs to access her own (insurance) money, and needs my help to get it. What the fuck are the experts there for if we can just look up answers on Wikipedia, or stream the movie from Netflix.

No big deal? My little app idea, extremely simple, dead simple using code freely available on GitHub, in one year would save 2.25 million phone calls, 12 million minutes of waiting on hold, 100,000 of unpaid adjuster overtime hours, and 100 million insurance dollars. Even better, we'd start making a database of all insurance claims. So we could start learning, and therefore preventing, why crashes, and car fires, happen. Amazingly something so simple isn't already done. It would help so much. Instead I heard silence, and of course BEEP-BEEP-BEEP.

I always had a hobby of writing politcal philosophy since leaving university. Specifically, the politics of the share economy. I was gonna release it in short bursts I hoped a few hundred might read. Fuck it. People are literally dying in car crashes every day, getting burned alive inside their own property, and I'm getting BEEP-BEEP-BEEP by experts who want to pretend it's 1980. The Blockbuster economy refuses, like the religious priests of old who refused to look through Galileo's telescope, to update to new technology. Their ignorance inspires revolutions.

This book is my contribution to that bullshit. I'm hooked to it.

## Happy Netflix Customers, Happy Blockbuster Employees

The divide between closed access DVD technology, to open access internet technology defines the divide between happy and unhappy. Because for the vast majority of our economy, we still work at, and use the Blockbuster way of life. Although increasingly the masses know the Netflix way of life is possible.

To be fair everyone resists upgrading _their_ job. There's a phenomenom of "I want to work at Blockbuster, and I want to use Netflix" in our society. Lots of people want to keep getting paid for the Blockbuster fees, while having to pay the Netflix costs. This happens because there is no official plan to transition to the Digital Age, Netflix economy. Thus people working at the Blockbuster's throughout our economy are scared.

Practically speaking what can the average person do. Most people don't, and will never work at "Netflix". Netflix is so cheap and efficient because it doesn't need much manual labour like stocking shelves, managers to open and close stores, HR reps to do the intake forms for new employees, and executives doing deals with their piers over whatever. No lobbyists to lower minimum wage, no unions to fight against it, activists to protest the smog from deliver trucks. Still, how does the middle class, who likely works for the  ruling nobility, pay their bills while building the Netflix economy of the future?

Good thing we don't have too. The player god doesn't wait for anyone. He keeps playing the game. Thus, just like Netflix, the Netflix economy already exists. We just need a new Digital Age philosophy card to click we'll democratization of our functions like insurance, news, and politics.

### Romeo and Juliette Triangle

![Romeo and Juliette](img\ch1\triangle-baking.png)
**Romeo and Juliette:** Two great families really don't like each other. The feud is like boozing to an alcoholic, no purpose but it feels great anyway. The feud goes on until two youngsters catch each other's eyes across the battle line. The setting is wealthy Renaissance Italy. The passions are hatred contrasted by love. Dialogue reinforces the us versus them dynamic, and especially the love story. The antagonist is both family's tradition of hatred. Thought is mindless hatred juxtaposed by soulful love. Two kid protagonists rise above and risk everything for their passion. Love winds up killing them but also the feud that kept them apart.

## THE STORY OF GEO AND HELIO

So that is story. We live stories whenever encountering, dealing with, and solving problems. Since the middle class live problems everyday, we often live inside a story. Thus by understanding stories we can understand our reality. We don't have proof of that yet. I'm saying stories are a lens into human reality, that's quite a statement, but there's no technology to show you. No telescope. It's like when Friar Bruno told people the truth about the solar system, he just had reasoning; the rationality of irrationality. So let's make the telescope into our reality. A piece of technology that shows us the moons of Jupiter. Let's use a story we already know. The one between geocentrism and heliocentrism.

Let's set the stage. The Renaissance.

The Renaissance was a cultural movement that profoundly affected European intellectual life in the early modern period. Beginning in Italy, and spreading to the rest of Europe by the 16th century, its influence was felt in literature, philosophy, art, music, politics, science, religion, and other aspects of intellectual inquiry. Renaissance scholars employed the humanist method in study, and searched for realism and human emotion in art.

Renaissance humanists sought out in Europe's texts of Antiquity, while the Fall of Constantinople (1453) generated a wave of émigré Greek scholars bringing precious manuscripts in ancient Greek, many of which had fallen into obscurity in the West.

Renassaince artists strove to portray the human form realistically, developing techniques to render perspective and light more naturally. Political philosophers, most famously Niccolò Machiavelli, sought to describe political life as it really was, that is to understand it rationally. A critical contribution to Italian Renaissance humanism Giovanni Pico della Mirandola wrote the famous text "De hominis dignitate" (Oration on the Dignity of Man, 1486), which consists of a series of theses on philosophy, natural thought, faith and magic defended against any opponent on the grounds of reason. In addition to studying classical Latin and Greek, Renaissance authors also began increasingly to use vernacular languages; combined with the introduction of printing, this would allow many more people access to books, especially the Bible.

We need a protagonist. Let's use Bruno. Copernicus and Galileo are famous enough. Bruno's life could fill volumes. He was a protagonist in every sense of the word. He rose above the predominiate thought; Aristotialn and Christian theology. Born in 1548 he became a priest in 1572, studied theology in a monastary, getting his doctrate in 1575. He was investigated for his controversial views, and was soon frustrated enough to fle his monastic order in 1576. He was excommunicated and spent the next 16 years travelling western Europe.

Bruno was poor. He worked at a printer, he taught Latin, and did what he needed to make ends meet. He wanted to teach philosophy at a University. He did for a few years before Protestants kicked him out. He was a known rebel anyway which probably didn't help getting hired. He was smart and caring, but had a hard time getting passed the interview. He wouldn't wear the mask of professionalism others could with ease. That's probably why all three major  western religions, Catholics, Calvinsits, and Lutherans, all excommunicated him. That's like the USA, the Soviet Union, and Iran all hating you. Can you think of anyone today with that achievement?

If you met Bruno you'd know why he's so distinguished. He wasn't easy to deal with. Ever talk to a homeless man? Not the one having a good time on drugs or the one drifting from place to place until he grows up. The quiet guy who walks around a lot, probably keeps a pet, could use a shower and haircut if he could stop to look at himself. But he doesn't care about what he looks like. He's too busy thinking about his own world. Thus, he's a perfectly nice person, means harm to no one. Content with himself. Never wanted to interview anyone. Never wanted to be interviewed. That fake world of masks, pretension, and manners is boring. It's not real. And whatever you bribe him with won't be enough because the homeless man won't even look at your material rewards. Fake is fake, and his unique reality is more interesting. So walk around he does, thinking of reality that only he knows. He loves when you agree with him, but he can't get many people to understand because can't describe it to you exactly. His reality just fits him so well he doesn't know how to explain it. So he doesn't. A perfectly nice person.

Until you take him out of that reality. Until you tell him that reality isn't real. That in fact he's living the lie. That he should change. Then you'll see the nice man become a guardian and defend his reality like a parent defending a child. All he has in the world shall not be taken away. No moderation is possible. Stubborn, asshole, foolish, crazy, many names label that man. It's best to leave the man alone, let him be, and let him live.

If you've ever talked to someone like that, if that sounds familiar, then you've talked to Friar Bruno. The difference is Bruno didn't have a unique reality in his head he was happy to live within. He had a reality in his head he demanded others live in. That's why Bruno's life wasn't spent walking around Naples, minding his own business. It was spent writing, lecturing, debating everyone and everything in all of western civilization. He pissed off everyone. Bruno was kind of right, but we remember him more because he was the tip of the spear.

Here's why.

He had constant realizations of a new reality in his head. He struggled to make the reality in his head real for everyone else. He suffered during his journey. He was rewarded with publications and fame, and punished with scorn and infamy. His life was a drama. He never gave up. Many people were his antagonists. Occasionally regular people with their stubborn beliefs, but usually it was high ranking clergy and political leaders who attacked him, usually with dialogue in spoken threats or written condemnations.

He used dialogue to fight for his reality. Writing many books, having many debates, giving many lectures, and finally a trial for his life. He had great passions, and he used tools of pen and paper, writing and speech to interface with the world he wanted to change.

Bruno's life had a plot, a beginning, middle, and end. An end point that controlled everything else inside. Convince the world of something he could never prove. Bruno wanted to create, or destroy, a Death Star that didn't exist yet. Bruno needed the telescope to prove himself. The absence of a telescope make his personal story a tragedy. He could never have won. He never stood a chance. Yet his mental story was a full blown victory. He is a protagonist of history.

Bruno's life was a functional story. He too wondered about reality like Neo in _The Matrix_. He received variations from the infinite Universe and compiled them in his head. He saw an error in the typical thought in his day.

The lessons is many. Bruno didn't have one story, one antagonist, one realization, or one suffering. He's life was complex, varied. Life isn't a single story, but hundreds of simultaneous stories. Yet each is still just a story. Some are art, spectacle, and functional.

Even more fun is the size of story. Or the length. Some stories can be told in real-time, some are about days, weeks, or years. And some can be about generations and even epochs. So to do the stories of real life. Because our stories are inside these varied time frames. Some conclusions impactful, some almost meaingless. Sometimes we learnt the lesson, sometimes we can't find meaning in our lives like so many audiences of art films.

## STORIES GLUE THE LEVIATHAN TOGETHER

The above are Aristotle's story elements. They make up stories like atoms make up elements. Now we have to use these tools, to understand our real lives. Let's start if off when

You might have noticed something interesting.

Each step has more meaning behind it. The first steps are somewhat superficial. For example it's easy to take a picture of an item or someone using an item. Now try taking a picture for rules, antagonist, thought, protagonist, plot and it gets progressively harder. The story elements get less material and more meaningful. The reader must be conscious of the story for each level's picture to make sense.

![Consciousness](img\ch1\story-triangle-consciouness.png)

So stories are compacted consciousness. Thus if a story is well told, and especially if it's an archetypal story, as we experience stories, we share consciousness. That's why stories are the way in which society's community about their ruling philosophy.

You really need to be consciouness of the story to understand higher levels. So lower levels are material, and get more immaterial with each step. That's why plot is vital, the sequence of events gives higher purpose to items and people who themselves don't mean much.

[![Characters with plot vs no plot](http://img.youtube.com/vi/https://youtu.be/FxKtZmQgxrI?t=406/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/FxKtZmQgxrI?t=406)
_Star Wars (1977-1983) contrasted with Star Wars (1999-2005). The original movies were well told. The characters lived inside a healthy plot. The new movies are not well told. Characters don't have a plot to give them life. They have less consciousness. You can see the difference in this nice breakdown._

So, what's above plot? What's more immaterial then plot? Look again to consciousness.

Here we come back to the archetypal stories. In each archetypal story there's a higher purpose. Like Cinderella fighting to go from rags to riches, Frodo's journey to destroy the evil ring in the _Lord of the Rings_, or the moral rebirth of Scrooge in _The Christmas Carol_. Archetypal stories exist because they're so like our real lives. Life inspires fiction and fiction inspires life. There's a reinforcing cycle. You've been the hero of your own movie many times. You've been the hero of other people's lives too. We are often motivated by archetypal stories. The thing that inspires fiction and real life is, life. Life is the thing about plot in every story.

## Conclusions are black holes

Conclusions are our black holes. A back hole is so powerful both physical worlds of gravity and quantum mechanics co-exist. Since functional plots are a reasonable course of events they are like gravity; reasonable and predictable. Functional characters act with reasonably understood emotions, so are comparable to the somewhat understood world of quantum mechanics. This analogy helps understand conclusions are like black holes. A place so powerful both reason/plot, and emotion/character co-exist with shared importance. Inside our black holes we have the creation of new realities, but only when Aristotle's story elements are aligned inside a functional story.

Why do protagonists care so much? Luke Skywalker was one kid on a farm, what are the chances he'd make a difference fighting an evil galactic empire? Romeo and Juliette were like 15, and they died for each other? Was Neo's life of solitude and poverty inside the Matrix worth it to find out he's a slave? The answer is yes, it's why we remember their names.

We love these protagonists because they're archetypes. Fiction inspires real life protagonists, and real life inspires fictional protagonists. Both real and fake archetypes want to make the world a better place. That means overcoming problems inside a functional story.

Functional stories come from our eternal need solve problems. That's why spectacle and art stories never reach archetypal status. Spectalce and art are inspired by humanity to serve their passions. Only function serves a higher purpose of questioning our reality to make the world a better place. We venerate archetypes to inspire us to do the right thing. We need to connect with the consciousness of those who solved our problems before us. A time when the items, passions, dialogue, antagonists, and thoughts were different, but the plot was the same. Solve problems, defeat the bad guys on the way to a better life.

![Super-plot](img\ch1\story-protagonist-higher-calling.png)
_A person moves from item to a protagonist when they ignore all existing story elements and get inspired by a higher calling._

I like to think our soul drives us forward, but you can fill in any other kind of higher calling you like. Whatever it is, a higher calling inspires protagonists to make reality a better place to live.

We love these protagonists because they're heroes. Fiction inspires real life protagonists, and real life inspires fictional protagonists. Both real and fake heroes want to make the world a better place. That means overcoming problems inside a functional story.

Functional stories come from our eternal need solve problems. That's why spectacle and art stories never make history status. Spectalce and art are inspired by humanity to serve their passions. Only function serves a higher purpose of questioning our reality to make the world a better place. We venerate heroes to inspire us to do the right thing. We need to connect with the consciousness of those who solved our problems before us. A time when the items, passions, dialogue, antagonists, and thoughts were different, but the plot was the same. Solve problems, defeat the bad guys on the way to a better life.

## Camels in the Amazon

Now let's put humanity inside life's evolution. You might have noticed some similators. We mimick life's evolution with our technology. And our dreams are visions of the adaptions we need to make real, through our own microstories.

Now I were to show you a desert fox in the Artic, a dolphin in a pond, or a camel in the Amaxon you'd automatically see something wrong. Not with the lifeform, we take our kids to visit all of them in the zoo, but you'd see something wrong with the mixing of a lifeform into a foreign ecosystem.

Now I were to show you daily newspapers in England, gasoline cars in China, or McMansions in America, what would you think? Nothing, despite England have few paper mills, China no oil fields, or Americans having no desire build and clean mansions. You wouldn't see the same mix match between lifeform/adaptation and it's ecosystem. You wouldn't see foriegn lifeforms because you wouldn't see different ecosystems.

That's because right now, our society is still stuck in the immediate growth part of economics. The grasses, weeds, and ferns that life rushes in, so it'll secure itself against entropy. The stiff competition, and ownership of property rights are exactly what happened in politics and economics. With politics it happened after Clovis (453) I to Charlemagne (800) secured Western Europe after Rome's collapse. To create the grasses, weeds, and ferns, humanity was forced into strict roles of feudal king, priest, knight, gentry, and peasant. Feudalism fostered the beginnings of political life. The nobilities descendants then passed on their political control right via inheritance, despite the fact the political situation was much different by 1500. Europe actually had enough political freedom, enough political "carrying capacity". Humanity had to enter the political ecosystems via revolutions.

After we did, we have enough carrying capacity left over to make economic grasses, weeds, and ferns. We let economics being owned by the first lifeforms to find prosperity. We encouraged their growth via economic property ownership, which was to be passed on via inheritance. And like in nature, and politics, once we had enough carrying capacity, we will start making economic ecosystems.

But for now we are camels trying to live in the Amazon.

## Insurance Money

Let's find out. It's not a simple question. Who was I working for? Picture yourself at the side of the road, car's smashed, you've paid $15,000 in insurance money, and you need it back. So how should this work?

Today after a car carsh, you need to get (insurance) money. That means calling a 1-800 number during business hours, waiting on hold, and eventually talking to an adjuster. The adjuster gets the accident details, check's your account, and eventually send's a check. The entire process takes a few weeks.

Adjusters process dozens of phone calls, emails, voicemails, and faxes a day. It was hilarious learning how to fax something. Did you know the fax machine (1865) was invented before the telephone (1876), and we’re using both to process claims for people who just had a real-life NASCAR experience-gone-wrong in the 21st century.

This doesn't tell us who owns insurance money. But it does tell us who doesn't want to give it back too quickly. Among the approximately 10,000 calls I answered over the years, one call stands out the most. A car crash, and the young driver died on impact. Slide on ice. No one to blame, just a lifetime of unanswerable questions for the father. The father was geniunely lost. So was I. Unlike 911 calls, the people aren’t frantic when talking to an adjuster. They’ve had time to consider everything. They need guidance. Adjusters quickly learn to throw away the mandatory talking points and just talk like a real person. Often adjusters were just shoulders.

I talked to this gentlemen about life, families, my future, his, God and…

DING!… DING!… DING!… DING!… DING!… The supervisor was ringing his bell, what he used to tell us “get back to work, answer more phone calls!”. In the age of super computers and high speed interent in everyone’s hands, this asshole is ringing a bell, so I’ll… Send faxes faster?

So the question of asking who owns insurance money, led me to ask, who do I work for? The person who needs their insurance money to repair their life, or the company tasked with protecting it? Is this bell, fax machines, and 1-800 number the best this gentleman’s annual $2,000 insurance payment gets him. Why is modern technology like WhatsApp and Skype nearly free, while thousands of dollars gets faxes and telephones.

## Prologue intro

Writers call your first impression of a story, “the hook”. Hooked means exactly what it sounds like. Being controlled, in this case by a good story, but in reality, you can be hooked by anything in your life. Like being in love with Juliette, or working to cure cancer. Most people are hooked on paying their bills, and thus are hooked on having a job.

I'm one of them. I've been a movie usher, a projectionist, a officer clerk, a drywaller, a claims adjuster. And I'm probably going to have a bunch more before my story ends. Now I want to scream about these jobs. Even though I enjoyed most of them, I can't help but remember their stupidities. Like how movie ushers spend 90% of their time picking up garbage, but can't ask customers to stop dropping it. Or how claims adjusters talk about car accidents days or weeks after they've happened, with people who had a smartphone at the accident! I want to talk about how much of my story I've wasted on these stupidities.

But I know all workers have the same problem. Work is often stupid. We laugh at it when watching shows like _The Office_, because having a job is confusing, because who do you work for? The person who needs help to watch a movie, or process a claim, or the company paying you? The customer and the company are not the same person. And the worker is stuck in between trying to make both happy.

The truth is every worker isn't working for either. They're a specialist in a technology, be it a projector, or a drywall knife. Every movie theatres has customers, watching a movie from a projector. Every insurance company has drivers, processing claims at a call-centre. Technology is the greatest hook of all. And we're all controlled by our chosen technologies success and failure.

I'll show you. Did you know Wikipedia had a sister called Nupedia. With Nupedia only “expert” professors could make articles, while Wikipedia let anyone contribute, but tracked every change to help erase any errors or vandalism.

Conventional thinking said people would go to the experts. They after all had a history of being in control of society's books of knowledge. Well the first problem was the experts didn't like to share. In their first year, Wikipedia had 40,000 articles. Nupedia had 12. The second problem was it turned out "expert" answers, and answers, are actually the same, Mount Everest is 8,848 metres high nobody who says it. And Wikipedia was far better at finding and sharing answers. Now Nupedia is long dead, Wikipedia has millions of articles, and books of knowledge have turned into Wikipedia searches.

This isn't a simple lesson. I was at an “elite university” when Wikipedia was spreading, learning about the philosophy of technological innovations. The best education I got was seeing the experts antagonize their own futures. Few professors could undertand regular people were experts of something, and were happy to contribute, share, and trust their knowledge. With the right technology, the people could educate themselves.

Yet even professors were threatened. Even though Wikipedia was just a better encylopedia, it doesn't do advanced research, they still couldn't admit Wikipedia's technology is better. Heck, hundreds of thousands of students write term papers every year, that are graded and thrown away. Some could just as easily write or improve Wikipedia articles.

But no. Instead Wikipedia is still mocked, even through it's simple better than books. It was like watching Blockbuster laugh at Netflix because the DVD was the future of movies (which Blockbuster did), or Xerox give Apple the designs for the personal computer because the photocopier was the future of office work (which Xerox did). Now 15 years after Wikipedia started, it's joined by even more technologies, like YouTube, Khan Academy, Udemy, all of which are slowly replacing lecture halls, libraries, and even universities.

So we are all slave to the technology we use. What does this story look like? Because workers still need to pay their rent. So they resist modern technology, while needing it to improve their lives. Otherwise we'd still be buying enclopida's that get old within a few years, renting DVD's, or calling an insurance company to make a claim. The Blockbuster's of the world, universities, printing companies, claim departments, refuses to update to new technology. Their ignorance inspires revolutions.

## Prologue - Notice How Much Darth Blockbuster Likes to Party

Why wouldn't professors, who exist and are paid to research, like to share knowledge. Why wouldn't AT&T want more communication running over its network. Why wouldn't Xerox want personal computers. Why wouldn't Yahoo want to search the internet. Why wouldn't Blockbuster like to help people watch movies faster.

Because these institutions, once on the cutting edge of technology, slowly became filled with Darth Blockbusters. Darth Blockbuster is not a worker on the front-line trying to do a better job. He's a self-entitled piece of shit.

At least that what it seems like. In reality, he likes to party, because he can't foresee a new society, One based on the new technology. Thus Darth Blockbuster defines success by their climb up established institutions hierarchies, as being esteemed princes and executives. They antagonize the grandstory of civilzation's invention of new technology to maintain their status. They use prestige of past heroes to hide their self-entitlement. Supposed divinity, exclusivie parties, stuck-up language, and fake titles are his defense.

Protagonists doubledown. People like Galileo who foresaw a world of science, Alan Kay who foresaw a world of personal computers, and Paul Baran who foresaw a decentralized internet of computers, keep fighting for a better civilization despite so many antagonists.

Thus, my parents aren't protagonists because they fight on top of skycrapers. They're simple curious, smart, hard working, and most important selfless. They showed me middle class extras become protagonists when they embrace new technology. While so many professors, managers, and executives at my jobs would insist university, DVD's, and call centres were the future, despite all the evidence otherwise, my parents, like so many middle class people, would just shut up and learn new technology.

New technology brings new capabilties and thus questions who should hold the power over it. Workers always have a job to do, and thus care about being a better builder, cleaner, or adjuster. While "managers" and "executives" sub-consciously know, nobody has ever had a problem and said "does anyone know any good executives?".

Every organization needs management. But excessive management is a sign of bad technology inside a company, country, or civilization. It means the jig-saw puzzle making of technological creation has stopped to keep the antagoinsts party at full throttle. Thus, new technology constantly empowers individuals to become protagonists and do away with Darth Blockbuster.

Wikipedia is an obvious example. It costs basically nothing compared to our college system. Yet with no official support from anyone in power, and very little management, it's built a knowledge-base that's amazing. And this "Wikinomics" is transforming our civlization by empowering extras, who need far less managerial oversight, because protagonists regulate themselves when freed to live their own mission.

GitHub is like a Wikipedia for computer programs. It lets anyone download and update software. Before GitHub programmers were mostly wage labourer extras. Now their supercharged protagonists who program Wikipedia, Linux, Firefox, and other extremely powerful software, that's free for anyone to use. Before Netflix came along, it was internet "thieves" that introduced online streaming to the world. Community made content on Khan Academy, YouTube, and Udemy, educate for virtually free.

These examples are a few pieces of the jig-saw puzzle the future needs us to build. New technology upturning old industries is a recurring story throughout human history. It happened with politics. The key to victory was always to empower the extras to become protagonists on the side of new technology. To do that requires a new idea to attract the extras. The new idea is for extras to see their leaders as antagoinsts, holding everyone back from moving forward in the grandstory.

New ideas are the job of philosophers. People who go back to basics, and make a new storyline with a new philosophy. If their words are magic enough, they make the extras realize they should stop watching the story, and instead become a protagoinsts by picking up a weapon, and start fighting. One of the best examples was the American and French Revolutions which empowered individuals to wiki their politics, and they were inspired by the magical writing of Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

## Prologue Douglass

Think of Douglass' story. When it happened in 1841, hero and villian switched depending on geography. In the agrarian American South, Sophia would have been a comedic extra for trying to teach a slave to read. Hugh would be a hero for defending slavery. The northern abolitionists would be Darth Vader trying to destabilize the entire economy. And everyone would scream as Douglass got on the ship "he's getting away!".

At the same time, in the industrialized North, people disliked slavery. But not out of morality. Their dislike was because slavery was competition for their own paid work and the machines they loved to build. Hugh was thus maybe a jerk, but not a villian, Sophia should have learned the Southern way, and Douglass should stay away from Northern jobs. In fact trying to keep slavery out, or in, of new American states like Kansas was what sparked the American Civil War (1861-1865).

However, at the same time, the British hated slavery. Hugh was a villian, Sophia was a coward, and Douglass was a glorious protagonist. Douglass actually helped make sure Britain didn't recognize the American South as a country, depriving a powerfulally to the slavers. Also, it it was Irishmen who gave Douglass the money to buy his freedom. Thus, if you lived in the American South, North, and British Empire, all places with similar cultures, you'd see Douglass story three different ways.

And this is how we Today our microstories still have this uncertainty. We simply don't have the perspective to all agree on the same protagonists and antagoinsts. Think of all the things we've fought over since Douglass. Segregation, affirmative action, diveristy training, gay marriage, gun rights, global warming, health insurance, union rights, abortion, migrants, foriegn factories, refugees, capitalism, communism, fascism, environmental regulations, conservatives versus progressives, neo-conservatives vs conservatives, progressives versus socialists, and so many more issues. We keep battling each other, everyone fueled by visions of being Luke Skywalker striking down Darth Vader.

- With institutions by asking why wouldn't professors like to share knowledge. Why wouldn't AT&T want more communication running over its network. Why wouldn't Xerox want personal computers. Why wouldn't Blockbuster want people watching more movies.

It's often called the innovator's dilemma. The more successful a tool gets, the larger the institution needed to support it. It's like buying a bigger house and watching the expenses pile up. But with companies expenses are product lines, buildings, employee contracts, management levels, and other "weight". Many people inside will scream how weight makes solving the tools original problem of "telecommunications", "knowledge", and "storytelling" lost in red tape. Large institutions have bills to pay and using increasingly old technology to pay them is an inconvenient truth. Foresight is a luxry. New technology is a threat.

Some people are natural Darth Blockbuster's. They selfishly want success but are too stupid or risk averse to invent new tools to earn it. Yet, large institutions breed many more antagonists because of the innovator's dilemma. Think of all those Blockuster regional store managers, or better yet, all those PhD students of Film Studies, and Geography. Can these experts upload their knowledge on Wikipedia. Maybe, but they definitely want their money back. And that means promoting a prestigous university to the next generation. Old tools become a hot potato nobody wants to be left holding.

This is actually good news. Conquering large institutons is easier than conquering human selfishness. We just need to keep inventing new technology, like Wikipedia, to undercut bygone institutions. While this may suck for those invested in the past, it helps anyone who plans on living in the future.

## Frederick Douglass

he story gets even better. Frederick quickly found friends in the north free states. A radical Christian minority called abolitionists who took the Declaration of Independence literally when it said "all men are created equal".

It wasn't long before Frederick was at a hall of these freedom lovers. People, like his once upon a time angel Sophia, who treated him as a man. These people ignored the clicking of society's rules and wanted to hear him speak. In a time with no pictures, no movies, no telephones, Douglass was the source of knowledge they couldn't get. What was slavery really like? Are blacks really dangerous? Are slaveowners cruel? What is the truth?

Frederick rose and spoke. His oratory matched his bravery. He spoke again, and again and again. Douglass told everyone what Hugh said to Sophia to make her follow the rules; "if a slave learned to read, he would learn about the world, and the slave would become unhappy with his condition and desire freedom." Douglass said this was the first anti-slavery speech he had ever heard. Sophia thought she could be a good citizen to Maryland, a good wife to Hugh, and a good person to Douglass, by keeping him ignorant.

Frederick Douglass took the lesson well. He spread his brilliant oratory beyond the sound of his voice, in the best way. With words. He wrote many books, and he wrote them so well, it clicked millions of people into a new set of rules. Slavery is evil, _all_ people are equal. You can read it now in many books. It would make Douglass happy you educated yourself, and understood why these are the good rules.

Another is how poor the rebel armies were. A reflection of the society, they were always hungry, short of supplies, and even shoeless. The war's decisive battle at Gettysburg (1863) was fought because the town had a shoe factory the south wanted to raid.

If you see war as a battle of tools, the south had slavery, the north had machines. One needs ignorance and oppression, the other education and innovation. Frederick

## Personal blah

The key to empowering the extras is giving them the tools. It wont be easy. I studied the question for a while while working a host of front-line job. I made a new tool that saved about 100 million in operating costs for an industry. I didn't want any fame or fortune, I just wanted to empower co-workers to have better workdays, and some time to write a boring philospophy book.

Getting it approved by the power-brokers was like talking to Darth Vader. They never even asked the extras on the frontline. Instead always found a reason why the new tool was wrong, and the old tool was right. I was supposed to sing and dance for them. Instead I wrote my philosophy book like a rallying call for the extras. And made a new app that will save tens of billion in operating costs and return it to the middle class, so we can all sing and dance to our own music.

For example, the movie theater is a nearly dead storytelling tool in our society. That's not an opinion, I worked inside empty auditoriums for years. However, mass media and studios ignore this, among other ways, by bragging about high "box-office grosses". A movie's gross includes currency inflation, ticket price and population increases. It's meaningless to gauge popularity year over year. Ticket sales are far better, but those are kept secret.

Frontline insights like show how contemporary philosophies don't matter. Although actors are often proud progressives, and corporate businessman often staunch capitalists, they work together to keep a dying tool alive. The difference between good and bad guys is simple proximity. When you count empty theatre seats because you feel the pain of less shifts, while at the same time, you feel the pain of full theaters overflowing with garbage, you wish for a better way, and thus want a better tool. The further you are from the frontline, the more you filter out the truth with things like movie grosses, gender equality, or some other philosophical.

## Movie Theatres Vertival Integration

The movie industry should be solving this problem. It tried throwing money at it with 3D movies, but 3D tell bad stories. The short answer is theatres and studios are separate industries who hate each other. They should unify like Apple Stores, and start working together to give people an affordable night of entertainment. But they can't without questioning who should be in control. So the higher ups in both dying industries hide inside movie grosses.

The lesson is, only the people who count empty theatre seats because they feel the pain of less shifts have a good reason to make changes and invent new tools. In this case live entertainment, cheaper prices, story quality control, double features, affordable food all work well. The further you are from the frontline, the more you filter out real problems.

And here you can see the cast of characters. People on the frontline with the incentive to make new tools, with people in positions of power around the old tool, who don't. This happens on most every new tool. Frontline workers like game developers, taxi drivers, or hosts love Steam, Uber, and AirBnB, while the higher up you go in retail game stores, taxi companies, and hotel corporations, always find reasons to stop it.

## Fight with the recap of chapter, too long

Let's reflect a little bit on our civilization's story. Humanity has a stream of problems like cold, hunger, and disease. We solve them with tools. To solve them better, we need new tools.

Protagonists respond. Of course they do, they're heroes. They use new technology to invent new tools to ease the pain on the frontline. Their continued self-sacrifice slowly empowers people so we all solve our problems with better knowledge, efficiency, and dependability.

Then we have antagonists. Tools develop a power structure, and we reward people for rising in it. Thus, when protagonist's new tools undercut the power structure, antagonists selfishly respond to defend their wealth, power, and prestige.

Antagonists often manage companies or institutions based on dated tools. They look down, but unknowingly fear, working on the frontline because feeling its pain invalidates their old tools.

Lastly we have the extras, everybody in the middle of a battle between two tools. Because they have no direct interest they can pick winners and losers. Usually extras are in the middle class; not so poor as to be desperate, but not so powerful they want to keep the world the same. Sadly, extras don't realize their power.

This is a archetypal human story. Galileo fought a religious establisment with a telescope, George Washington fought a political establishment with a musket, and Steve Jobs fought a economic establishment with an iPod. Nikola Tesla, Marc Andressen, Elon Musk are other heroic examples. Each protagonist was lucky enough to win over the extras.

And that's why you need to stop watching and start fighting. It is important to remember the story is about supporting new tools, not fighting a group of people. Dated philosophies are the bullies against "bankers" and "lawyers", "rich" and "poor". We fight problems, and thus fight _for_ tools, not against groups of people who may or may not be antagonists.

After all, our lives cut across many poblems and tools. We can be a protagonist for a new tool, an extra for many, and even an antagonist for a few. For example, while professors were antagonists to a better encyclopedia, many of Wikipedia's facts were discovered by professors, so they're hardly pure villians. Fight for better tax laws, road traffic, health care, the same way we fought for a better enclyclopedia, by supporting better tools.

To empower the extras in real time, they'll need to see antagonists in real-time. AT&T, Xerox, Blockbuster, would all like a trip into a time machine instead of being cautionary tales. Without one we have to wait for historical perspective to tell us who the antagonists are.

Until now. We need to empower extras to either support the good guys either as extras or protagonists. So in _Techvolution_, we'll have to learn how to tell the difference between good and bad tools. Thus, we'll spot antagonists in real-time. Real villians in need of a proper fight. Ones I call Darth Blockbuster.

## Professors no like Wikipedia for coursework

Typical of the story, Wikipedia was a small and unskilled hero, mocked by the established experts who refused to support "publish now" being open to the masses. I was at university when Wikipedia was taking off. It was amazing seeing self-described experts antagonize their own futures. I saw it most when asking why students couldn't be assigned Wikipedia articles to write or update.

They laughed at the idea. I wondered why. Academia is paid tons of money to find and document knowledge. They love to compete to publish obsure bits like "Is Film Noir a Movie Genre" to publications only their friends read. So why did the professors need to delegate millions of assigments, labs, and term papers, read them once, and throw the knowledge away; only to re-delegate the same work the next semester.

Wikipedia's mission statement is "Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge". In retrospect, but only after paying my tuition, I think I figured out why universities did not want to join Wikipedia's community. Another lesson from the frontline.

## Definitions

Protagonists: they selflessly invent, spread, and use new technology to make new tools. Usually close to the frontline, they individually struggle, but their continued self-sacrifice slowly improves life on Earth.

Antagonists: selfishly resist new tools to defend their wealth, power, and prestige. Antagonists often manage companies or institutions based on dated technologies and think working on the frontline is beneath them.

Extras: everybody in the middle of a battle between two tools. Because they have no direct interest in either side, they can pick winners and losers. Usually extras are in the middle class; not so poor as to be desperate, but not so powerful they want to keep the world the same. Sadly, extras don't realize their power.

## movie theatres

For example lets use movie theatres. They're a dying storytelling tool in our society. That's not an opinion, I worked inside empty auditoriums for years. However, mass media, theatres, and studios total ignore this, among other ways, by bragging about high "box-office grosses". A movie's gross includes currency inflation, ticket price jumps, and population increases. It's meaningless to gauge popularity year over year. Tickets sold are far better, but those are kept secret.

Frontline workers can't hide behind economic stats. Empty seats automatically mean less shifts. Changing the tool, movie theatres, makes sense to a frontline work. As does faster checkout lines, cleaner theatres, and better movies. However, entertainment reporters, movie marketers, industry spokesman, government regulators, can hide behind "rising movie grosses", thus defend their control over the tool, and thus antagonise change. Why rock the boat if you feel no pain?

## tribal politics

They did during industrialization when tools were mass produced because everyone worked in a highly interdependant economy geared towards mass production of tools. Businesses, bankers, workers, regulators,shared the same interests, and thus needed tribal politics.

Yet, tool making in the digital age is so easy and powerful, we don't need to huddle into massive groups of red vs blue, rich vs poor, owner vs worker. Everyone can be the hero of their own story because we can make custom tools for each individual problem. We can understand your travel requirements so you avoid traffic. Know what exact food will optimize your health. Specifically educate you on what you need to know. Customizable tools is a fundametntally different political and economic story.

## johnny's story

I was raised by parents who fled the communists of Eastern Europe. Their loveable mentality was people should work only when there's free time. Kidding aside (not really), they showed me how important tools are. Building a house, installing an air conditioner, cleaning a job-site, is simply using, many tools. The more the better.

I tried to keep this work ethic alive in my jobs. I was a newspaper boy, a movie theater usher, a projectionist, a bunch of factories and warehouses, an office clerk, an account manager, a claims adjuster. I was happily one of those co-workers you sometimes forget about because they just do their job.

That's why I'm (grudingly) grateful a nagging stutter made me too shy to leave the frontline. In retrospect, it's a great place to see where protagonists and antagonists come from. Frontline workers need tools because they do - either the house is there, or its not. Thus, they're natural protagonists

## How I Got Here

I'm nobody special. I was raised by parents who fled the communists of Eastern Europe. Their loveable mentality was people should work only when there's free time. Kidding aside (not really), I worked construction, cleaning, been a movie theater usher, a projectionist, a bunch of factories and warehouses, an account manager, a claims adjuster. A nagging stutter made me too shy to leave the frontline. I was happily one of those co-workers you sometimes forget about because they just do their job.

For a while I was a face painted ideologue but stopped when I realized I was still taking the bus regardless who won. I formally and informally studied the history and philosophy of technology for years. When I thought I knew my stuff, I made a new tool for an old industry. My little app was cheap, effective, and saved tens of millions of dollars. I was rightfully proud of it, and wanted to share my wisdom. But I didn't know shit. I was an extra up against gatekeepers.

I won't go into details. There's no need. If you've used Napster, Netflix, Lyft, Skype, Kickstarter, GitHub, AirBnB, or Firefox, you already know how empowering our new digital tools are. Many protagonists have worked hard to create the new tools of a wonderful new reality, but antagonists keep stomping on it. I'm happy I got bruised up. It taught me a new philosophy.

Now I feel like Galileo looking through his telescope and seeing the Earth revolve around the Sun. I took my small political wisdom, mixed in limited tech experience, added the bruises, and out of the oven came Techvoluion.

Stories sometimes need new languages for their new worlds. Ours needs a new philosophy. I made one for you. It was hard, but still way easier than dealing with those damn antagonists.

## IDK

Until we master making new tools, each new one will be made by a small group of protagonists obsessed with solving a problem in a better way. Many stronger, richer, and prestigious antagonists will suppress it build up prop up its existing tools. For example, Blockbuster used email, teleconferencing, and had a website, but wanted people to drive back and forth to its stores instead of pressing "watch now".

We will master our the creation of new tools when the extras realize their power. Because unlike an audience, extras are in the story, and thus if you realize your power, you can pick winners just be choosing the tool you want to use. Happily the extras fought for Wikipedia, online streaming, Telsa, and the rest already mentioned.

But there are millions of tools today not so lucky. So many of our problems, like rampant unpaid overtime, not sleeping enough, incomprehensible tax codes, expensive formal education, endless road traffic, glass ceilings, exist because the tools that'll solve them are repressed. The extras who care think "fiscal conservatism" or "democractic socialism" will help, the ones who don't binge Netflix. In truth all the extras have the same power to turn make lightsabers. Just by joining the battle over new tools.

## We Need A New Philosophy

Right now regular people are either obsessed with red vs blue politics, watching professional sports, another Marvel movie, or binging on Netflix.

It's no ones fault. Really it isn't. No one is to blame. We're extras because our society uses old philosophies. Until someone invents a new one, we're stuck with ones like conservatism (1781), progressivism (1868), marxism (1856), and free-market economics (1776).

We're using philosophies founded to help the world industrialize. Before rubber shoes, indoor plumbing, and electricity; when humanity could only mass produce a few tools like wood barrels, steam engines, and pencils. Businesses, bankers, workers, regulators, rightly needed highly interdependent philosophies.

Yet, tool making in the digital age is so easy and powerful, everyone can be the hero of their own story. We can understand your travel requirements so you avoid traffic. Know what exact food will optimize your health. Specifically educate you on what you need to know. 3D print your new hammer. Customizable tools is a fundametntally different political and economic story.

Using philosophies born when the moon was our nightlight is holding everyone in our society back. Even main characters in politics and business are suffering. Especially them actually. After all they have to try and motivate voters and employees to care using philosophies that can't.

Just look at the the recent shake ups. The Tea Party, Move On, Brexit, Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, Proud Boys, Antifa, Yellow Jackets. These aren't an accident. They're the result of our old philosophies not solving everday problems like road traffic, climate change, and shaky employment. Leaders think we're breaking the rules. But we're looking for new philosophy to improve our lives.

While I hope our leaders and political junkies likes it, if you're sick red vs blue politics, sick of being an extra, I wrote this book for you. Keep in mind, a new philosophy is a big deal. It's like writing a story for all society to act in. We'll go step by step.

## Personal Note

If you liked _Skin in the Game_, _Rework_, _Zero to One_, _The Great Degeneration_, and _The Innovators_, you'll probably like this book. These books are amazing and helped me make this one. And by the way, I never forgot about my little app. It got bigger and it'll be the lightsaber for the middle class. But more about that later.

And to Darth Blockbuster. You're not evil. But you can't work at Blockbuster and get to use Netflix. Because if everyone thinks like that, our entire civilization stays filled with Blockbusters, and that's fucking horrible. Nobody wins.

Moreoever, will all benefit inside a society that works for, not against, new digital tools. Politicians will govern more and fundraise less. Executives will lead us to the future and stop grinding out quarterly earnings. Marketers will brainstorm about cool new tools more instead of doing the ten millionith car commercial. Activists will empower the poweless with tools instead of marching and yelling.

Our wondrous digital technology will give us this bright future if we embrace it. Saying that, if you still want to scream at political rallies about Marxist ideology, or sit in a corner office and delegate work like Charles Montgomery Burns, that's on you. The digital age is one of individual empowerment with new tools. Help update our society, or be everyone's villian.

## misc from prologue

Teach or study at an expensive university lecture hall and you'll fight to keep it alive by saying government should pay; and thus be a old school socialist. Work in at Blockbuster with vanquishing DVD sales, you'll lobby both political parties to attack online streaming, increase tax-credits, and lower minimum wages. Make candy apples, and you'll tell everyone to eat candy apples.

## Preface

I'm nobody special. I've been a political ideologue, a movie theater usher, a projectionist, a bunch of factories and warehouses, an account manager, a claims adjuster. I had nagging stutter, which made me too shy to leave the frontline. I was happily one of those co-workers you sometimes forget about because they just do their job.

I formally and informally studied the history and philosophy of technology for years. When I thought I knew my stuff, I made a new tool for an old industry. My little app was cheap, effective, and saved tens of millions of dollars. I was proud of it, and wanted to share my wisdom. But I didn't know shit. All I did was run into gatekeepers.

I won't go into details. Instead I wrote this book. It was hard, but still way easier than dealing with those damn antagonists.

## New Prologue

Here's why. Politics is a story, and an election is the climax. And if we can't tell the difference, there's something wrong.

We care so much in _Romeo and Juliet_ and _Star Wars_, because either young love is embraced, or it dies. Either the rebellion is saved, or the rebels all die. These stories will live forever, because everyone appreciates what's at stake. There's nothing at stake in blue vs red, because they're not differenct enough.

## Frontline

Our world's in a bad state. And it wont get better until we fight back. The view from the frontline is the same. That's why I'm (grudingly) grateful a nagging stutter made me too shy to leave the frontline. In retrospect, it's a great place to see pain from so many different places.

The people are disadvantaged. We deal with problems, from small pots on our roads, to waiting on hold with our health insurance. Workers expect to get outsourced by bosses so busy looking up to the prince, they don't even know what the job at the bottom is.

So, although we work for companies, we are actually tool users. I mean, say you're a newspaper printer at the New York Times. You could go to the New York Post and do the same job. So although newspapers compete with each other, they're tied to the same technology.

You can see this divide yourself. Tell your co-workers and company you're leaving for a new industry. They'll give you well wishes and a good bye cake. Tell them you're going to a competitor. They'll make fun of you, and probably give you a good bye cake. Now tell them you invented digital newspapers. You've questioned their livelihoods, and they'll be scared.

But not everyone. Some people will be curious, some happy, and some will even fight back. And this battle over technologies is where the protagoinsts, antagonists, and extras of the playout the grandstory of humanity.

Good thing some protagonsits already have. Let's go to the war room and see the battle scared and the path to victory.

## Majic

While Darth Blockbuster can claim to be a innovator, he can't claim to be a majician.

## Listerine

You ever use Listerine? It's a good idea too. It kills 99.9% of bacteria. Actually I'm not a dentist or doctor, so maybe it's a good idea, I can't say for sure. It's definitely a good idea to santize your wounds by killing all the bacteria.

There's a link. The mouthwash is named after Joseph Lister. He was born a Quaker in 1827 England, trained to be a surgeon, and entered the Royal College of Surgeons in 1853. On his honeymoon, the new doctor visted medical research facilties, and fell in love with medical research, as did is wife Agnes, who was his life long lab partner.

From the beginning of time, to mid-1800's, doctors didn't wash their hands. Even when removing a limb, doctors would show up with blood stained gowns, surgical tools, and go to work in a small stadium. Surguries were so spectular people off the street would watch. No sanitation anywhere.

Nobody knew about microbiology. The general assumption was infections were caused by "bad air", so hospitals would be aired out, but never disinfected. The horror.

Lister read about Louis Pasteur's experiments with fermenting milk. Pasteur discovered the start of microbiology, and how to prevent food spoilage as a result (that's why we call milk "pasteurized").

Lister, and several others, connected the dots, and found a chemical solution to kill bacteria on human wounds. He experimented by cleaning surgical instruments and wounds and no surprise to us, his patients didn't get infections nearly as much. After some more research surgery became antiseptic. Today we don't watch it off the street, but behind television screens.

Except it took years to get the surgeons on board. Lister was mocked. The idea of "microorganisms" was incredible. Few people bought it and continued to air out hospitals instead. Even when President Garfield was shot, his surgeons worked on him for months

## Nobles divinity stories

All because society couldn't proactively change their ruling philosophy. The nobles divine right to rule was set to go on forever. When the anarchy of Rome's collapse was solved with a return to civilization, the "noble" rulers were divine without reason.

Like any story, our ruling philosophy should have a goal. With goals come a natural conclusion. Protagonists are heroes because they set to overcome's the stories problem, and achieve it's goal. It's only while the hero fights the villians, is she rightfully considered divine.

However, in stories when the problem is overcome, the hero returns to being a regular person, and loses his divinity. Unfortunately, people took the nobles divine right to rule literally. It wasn't a story of overcoming a problem, who thereafter had a No story.there wasn't a clause in the nobles divine right to rule to explain why these protagoinsts were divine (returning law and order), and thus there was no conclusion to the nobles divinity. Stuck inside their ruling philosophy, the nobles were protagonsits in their eyes, while being "Darth Kings" to history.

Similarly, on ruling philosophy as no conclusion built in. Ask any Darth Blockbuster you want, managing partnet at a consultanting firm, high priced lawyer, music executive, Professor of Distinguished Chair of Media Studies, when the problem that makes them an protagoinsts is overcome,so they can return to being a regular person. They won't even know what the fuck you're talking about. They're divine.

Thus, Skywalker we're doomed to the same fate. That's why we have to master the human story, to help the extras participate in Techvolution, and pick the real protagonists in the open source community.

## Sid Meier's Civilization

## APPLICATIONS

Let's see what the full triangle looks like.

![The Matrix](\../img\thewriter\triangle-the-matrix.png)
**The Matrix:** The story is about machines that enslave humanity inside a virtual prison that looks like 1990's America. Humans are connected with a connection into our skulls. The real world is a dystopia and people are power generators for the machines.

The antagonist machine leader likes the matrix, and defends the ruling philosophy of slavery. The protagonist Neo slowly realizes ways to master The Matrix's philosophy and overpowers the ignorant antagonists. The plot is about cutting the cord that lets the machines control human prisoners.

![Star War](\../img\thewriter\triangle-star-wars.png)
**Star Wars:** An entire galaxy is controlled by a evil Empire. Evildoers keep control with their superweapon Death Star. Meagre resistance fighters stole its schematics and might find a weakness. The antagonist is Darth Vader who needs to save the Death Star to keep the Dark Side on top of the eternal philosophy battle between Light and Dark Sides. The protagonist Luke slowly realizes how to master the Light Side and become strong enough to defeat Darth Vader. The plot depends of if Luke's missle will destroy the Death Star.

## Checks and Balances in the entertainment industry

When we hit the Digital Age in the 1970's, iTunes, Netflix, Steam and other digital distribution methods became possible. Still far off, but possible to start having a society that empowers individuals with open access, distributed, democratized technology. Tax forms, insurance claims, wedding invitations, doctor questions and answers, university lectures, textbooks, online voting, and so many other things were possible. The quick victory of Netflix shows how ready the masses are to upgrade to the digital age. The happy ruling nobility are happy antagonising the future instead.

While the people were being "pirates". The entertainment had endless banquets and balls. Movie premieres, talk shows, award shows, and launch parties. The Oscars, Correspondence Dinners, Emmy's, Golden Globes, Cannes Film Festival, Sundance Film Festival, Toronto International Film Festival, and so many others, all modern version of banquets and balls, with gates to keep you out, and rules put in place to make the good times going.

By the way, while the entertainment industry was calling regular people thieves from the party box, they were lobbying the people's government to give them tax credits. Between 2000-2009, California went from having 2/3 of production, to 1/3 because they didn't give in. The entertainment industry went from state to state, country to country, moving to whichever charged the least tax. It's so low now, they basically pay no taxes.

Also, you know the string of company names before a movie. Lile Acme Entertainment, those are tax shelters. Companies studios setup to make this one movie. Acme pays the studio a fee for the licensing rights of the story. Through a huge array of creative accounting, Acme always loses money, avoid taxes, and the studio keeps it fee.

Creative accounting, keeping wages low, and increasing prices on regular people is what defines a succesful movie executive. Old executives, like Harry Cohn, David O. Selznick, and Irving Thalberg were master storytellers. No surprised, since the 1970's, movie executives can't tell good stories. They use special effects, mass marketing, remakes, sequals, celebrities, and gore porn, to hide that fact. I'll let John Wayne explain it.

  > All the real motion picture people have always made family pictures. But the downbeats and the so-called intelligentsia got in when the government stupidly split up the production companies and the theaters. The old giants like Mayer, Thalberg, even Harry Cohn, despite the fact that personally I couldn't stand him—were good for this industry. Now the goddamned stock manipulators have taken over. They don't know a goddamned thing about making movies. They make something dirty, and it makes money, and they say, 'Jesus, let's make one a little dirtier, maybe it'll make more money.' And now even the bankers are getting their noses into it

Online downloading was merely a check and balance against antagonists. Once a company came along made a new tool that distributed the power to the people, the people happily formed a majic bond with it. And if they get abused again, the people know where to go to check the excess.

## Social Capital

Social capital - USA
<iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/trust-attitudes-in-the-us?time=1972..2014" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"></iframe>
Social capital is the trust people have in each other. The more people socialize, the more trust they'll have with each other. It's often called "Bowling Alone".

## Aristarchus Birthdays

For example, every birthday party used to be a celebration the Sun revolved around you. Think of how silly it is the Earth being  stationary, and the stars, galaxies, and Universe revolve around us. But the truth that was, when we could probe the Universe with our eyes.

We thought of the truth. Ancent Greek astronomer and mathematician Aristarchus of Samos (310-230 BC) said the Earth moved. He correctly figured out the relative sizes of the Moon, Sun, and Earth. He did it by testing a well in Egypt that once a year had no shadow. He reasoned the Sun is directly above it. On the same day he measured the shadow of the great Tower of Alexandria. He measured the distances and heights of everything, used the pythgorean theorem, and voila, the Sun is 80 times the size of Earth, and the Moon is one forth. Aristarchus thereafter said why would the Sun move if it's so much bigger.

Aristarchus was right, but his argument still lost because we didn't have the tools yet to see the truth. Aristotle said if the Earth moved so much, why don't the stars move in the sky. Aristarchus said the truth was the stars are extemely far away. But the truth was unbelieveable to people who measured things in feet so Aristotle won. The rule was thus the Sun revolved us on our birthdays.

Geocentrism was a big rule. It was rooted in the Bible, which was the basis of the ruling nobility's power too. When Copernicus used mathematics to question geo-centrism, it wasn't enough. When Galileo used the telescope it helped alot. However, it was only when telescopes got powerful and cheap enough the people could see the truth themselves, that we accepted we revolved around the Earth on our birthdays. Thereafter the rulebook coldn't be corrupted with human interpratations of the truth. Science took over to explain illness, disease, gravity, and the stars. Darth King's days were set the day kids started to get telescopes for their birthdays.

## Life Star

That damn Obi-Wan. He probably turned into a ghost like in the movie and went on vacation or wherever. But no worries. For I am Skywalker, destined to save the galaxy and bring balance to human evolution. So here we go. Let's build the Life Star.

We don't know exactly what it is. Yet we have a great starting point. It's opposite. Light is the opposite of dark the same way full is the opposite of empty. Knowing one, defines the other. The Death Star is a rule book written humans. The Life Star is the opposite of the Death Star.

So what is it? The Life Star is a rule book no human can write. Rules can't be added, fudged, or abused, only uncovered. Happily, we already use this rule book. It's  helped us truly understand our world in so many ways, in areas like chemistry, biology and physics. Of course I'm speaking about Nature.

Nature doesn't change. Gravity, thermodynamics, mitosis, are all rules. But no one can scratch them out and put in there own. Today a person can't say objects on Earth fall at 20 meters squared. The answer is 9.8 m2, and anyone can test it. The powerful are those who master the Truth, not those who write it.

It use to be the opposite. Before the telescope, microscope, and scientific method the powerful could tell everyone what the rules of Nature were. In Renaissance Europe, Friar Bruno (1548-1600) went from country to country telling everyone the human rules were wrong. The Earth revolved the Sun, and worst, there was other solar systems with other planets out there. God's Creation is a limitless Universe. He got burned alive for heresy against human made rules.

We know better today. Not because we're smarter, or wiser, or have better morals and ethics. We know better because we have better cyborgology. Like a ecosystem with more lifeforms, our tools can sense Nature better, and thereby probe it for answers.

We learned Nature with tools. It was microscopes, telescopes, and all the other scientific tools that merged with our natural senses, to probe Nature, and let us uncover its rules in every more detail.

Unlocking Nature's rules slowly undercut Darth Kings divinity. Soon they were the ones facing death for breaking Nature's rules.

Now it is digital tools the empower us to sense and probe Nature. Free of Darth Blockbuster's interference, the extras can spread sensory input with digital tools throughout our society. Since only the people on the frontline will decide good from bad, we'll start to understand what solves traffic, heart attacks, and climate change.

This economic enlightenment will under cut not only Darth Blockbuster's, but also the Sith's ability to corrupt society's man made rule book. Economic policies and political ideologies will cease to be human mande rules. The rules of that bring sustainable human life on Earth will

 Death Stars. Because once we build the Life Star, there's no room left for human made rules. The only rule will be natural selection of our own tools with unhindered Techvolution.

I'll explain the Life Star by asking you a question you can't answer. How old are you?

## Ruling Philosophy Rousseau

Rousseau said the nobility were con artists. They hid behind divinity to rule society for their self interest. Yet noble families ruled every European country. There had to be some reason for it, and there was. At first these families were declared holy by the people, because they were holy.

I'll tell a quick story to explain. It starts with the fall of Western Rome. Rome started as a republic in 753 BC and became a Empire in 27 BC. After several centuries of great prosperity, around 180, the Roman Empire started to suffer a general decline caused by frequent civil wars, declining population, bloated civil administration, greedy military, lazy civilians, stupid emperors, relentless barbarian invasions, and the pacificying effects of Christianty. Finally in 476 western Rome fell apart. The water didn't run. The judges didn't rule. The military didn't defend. It was chaos. Almost like a zombie apocolypse movie.

No kidding. Vikings raided, Arabs invaded, Vandals roamed. This is when the Dark Ages (500 - 1000) started. We call it the Dark Ages, because there is literally almost no record of anything. Few people wrote records, histories, manuscripts, laws; Western Europe went "dark". In times of such anarchy, the people needed security above all else. Whoever stopped the zombies must surely be holy.

The former Roman province of Gaul was at the centre of chaos. Native Celts were pushed out to Wales, Scotland, and Ireland by invading Germanic tribes. These tribes added to the chaos by warring with each other. Eventually however, the Franks won when their leader Clovis I (466-511), established a new kingdom. His dynasty ruled for centuries. Each new generation returned more law and order, and military protection, to the Kingdom of France.

The kingdom was backed by the one remaining Roman institution, the Roman Catholic Church. The churhes priests told the people to cherish their nobility. Sermons told the people the Bible says kings are God's chosen representatives. The people couldn't read the Bible themselves, or even understand the Latin of sermons, but it didn't take much convincing anyway. Raids, invasions, and attacks were less and less. With peace came better farming, trade, and growth. The nobles divine right to rule had the people's support. They could see the defeated invaders, and feel the full stomachs for themselves. Divinity was a logical reality.

The problem with the story of the nobles divine right to rule, wasn't the divinity of the original nobles. France's Kings after Clovis I, like Charles Martel (688-741) and Charlemagne (742-814), all fought on many battlefields to protect their people while making rules to help them prosper. Of course they were protecting their power and taxpayers too. But that's the point. The leaders and the people had a symbiotic relationship.

They worked well together. Soon after Charlemagne, Europe left the Dark Ages and entered the High Middle Ages (1000 - 1300). This time wasn't all the bad to live in, with relative peace, security, and wealth not seen since Rome's peak. We still celebrate it with "Medieval Times" and "Game of Thrones" romanticized stories.

The problem with the nobles's divine story, is the nobles divine right to rule didn't have a conclusion. As Europe kept improving through the High Middle Ages, Late Middle Ages, Renaissance, Enlightenment, it got more peaceful and richer.

But all the wealth was going to the divine nobility. Now long removed from fighting Vikings or Vandals, these nobles told themselves they were divine because of their "noble blood". The nobility that Rousseau knew didn't live in castles wearing dirty body armour of war heroes. They lived in opulant palaces and enjoyed endless banquets and balls. Cinderella wasn't even allowed in!

Here's a few paintings to showcase the change. One's of Charles Martel, and his people. The other of Louis XVI (1754-1793), and his people. You can see the difference in their clothing, and homes.

![Martel to Louis](/img\diagrams/techvolution-martel-louis.png)

Opulance and wealth. They're like signs of a ruling philosophy gone on too long. Early nobles wrote rules to encourage new tools forming majically connections with regular people and improving society for everyone. In the Middle Ages, peasant farmers were supposed to make tills to harvest more food, use screws to dig good wells, work iron to make lots of barrels.

However, as new tools kept getting more powerful, the nobles wrote rules to keep them away from the extras. Books, muskets, scientific instruments were all very empowering. They were kept away from the people by dark majic like fancier cathedrals and royal palaces. Tricks to prevent the people from connecting with new tools, to upgrade their cyborgology.

Here's an example of the divide. Louis XIV made a program to let French peasants visit the Palace at Versailles. Tours were free, and only required a hat and coat (spares were available for rent). Louis wanted "his people" to see how glorious his kingdom was. He thought once the people saw entire rooms made of gold, and hallways of mirrors, they'd see how lucky they were to live in his kingdom.

Ironcially, most peasants didn't have a mirror, and rarely saw their own face. When they saw the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles they saw all the needed in the splendid art and spectacle. The fact the royalty didn't pay taxes, and they did, meant something was wrong with the rules.

The large divide between ruling philosophy, and frontline problems, marked the impending end of the nobles divine right to rule. It was a change seen in the change of early nobles castles and armour, used to defend their people, into palaces and dresses, used to enjoy a fun time at society's expense. Banquets and balls marked the impending end of Darth King. We need to understand exactly why to help forecast our problems. And our answer is in mastering stories.

## Office Space

![Argh](\../img\stories\triangle-office-space.png)
**Office Space:**  Hits close to home, the story about the boring drugery of modern suburban life and office work. The ruling philosophy is commercialism that gives workers repetitive tasks and keeps them in line with absurd office culture and just enough money to pay their bills. The antagonist is the boss who gets a disproportionate amount of money, prestige, and power.

The protagonist is the guy who values his freedom more then money. The plot rests on whether the protagonist will control the tool, money, to free himself from having to work anymore.

## Charting Stories

What does a healthy story, its events, philosophies, characters, and items, work together.

Here's a legend.

![Legend](\../img\breakdowns\story-legend.png)

**Old Society** - The society before the story starts.
**Beginning** - When the protagonist breaks from society.
**Protagonist philosophy** - The good guy acts out his philosophy.
**Antagonist philosophy** -  The bad guy acts out his philosophy.
**Realizations** -  Moments when a character realizes something.
**Suffering of the Protagonist** - Long periods when the protagonists suffers.
**Reversal of Situations** - When the plot changes big time.
**Free will** - The time character's have to act. Small spread is grave danger, big is nothing matters.
**Conclusion** - The final battle.
**New Society** - The result of the battle.

This is the how story's look like. We'll map out the fight over new tools soon. First we have to see the three difference kinds of stories we'll encounter.

## Majic vs Dark Majic

Good movies are often called movie magic. Among the other reasons, I used the name majic for this reason. We know a person needs a story to continually surprise with reasonable revelations to connect with it. It turns out the same thing applies for anyone to majically bond with a tool. Understanding one, helps understand the other.

When someone bonds with a new tool, it's not because they know what's going to happen next, but because they reasonable believe they'll find surprising new uses and benefits.

Bad stories, and old tools are similarly related. Without memorable twists, turns, and good lines, bad movies have to take advantage of old memories, fancy effects, or mass marketing to attract attention. And this is degenerative like an addiction. That's why blockbuster movies keeping piling on the effects.

Likewise, old tools use these same techniques to distract from their dysfunction. Thus, we like good stories because they make sense, and lead us to new emotions, ideas, and memories, and we have to be tricked into liking bad ones because they exploit our old memories.

Thus, later kings were like a boring party guest. They told stories about their divinity and used dark majic techniques to distract from the fact that the people increasingly heard as bad stories. And that's the difference between the kings we loved, to the ones we hated. We'll see it better when we peel away the layers of stories.

## storytelling and majic

Trapped inside divinity, the nobles missed the opportunity to be the protagonists of the next great story in humanity. Starting in the Renaissance amazing new tools like mass printed books, guns, and scientific instruments, were ready and waiting to upgrade the people's cyborology. Society had millions of people like Frederick Douglas, waiting to learn the learn the majic of new tools. The nobles could have been the heroes of our history, and proactively changed society.

Instead, they used the ruling philosophy to make rules to block majic, and became our history's villians. Gun ownership was not allowed. Books had to be approved. Science was suspect. Left out of the naturally good story, the pompeous nobles tried to entertain their audience of extras with bad stories.

While the original nobles lived a functional story, the perfumed ones didn't. Starting in the renassaince they made spectacle for the masses with brilliant cathedrals and stuff, while increasingly living artful lives unbound from having to solve any problems. The majic of new tools was thus hidden from the people.

You can see this change from good to bad movies inside Star Wars. The original was a budget film. But it didn't matter. It was a good story that rung true with society who made it "divine" in their culture. Lines like "May the Force be with you", Jedi mind tricks, star destroyers, the opening text crawl, lightsabre duals, everything was believed in because Star Wars was a good story.

Fast forward to today and Star Wars movies aren't good. Like most blockbusters, they're effects filled, mass marketed, stories that don't make people scream, yell, cry, or rave anymore.

For simple proof, what's your favorite line or moment from a recent Star Wars movie? Even if you didn't see it 40 years ago, you'd still have an answer because fans didn't shut up about it.

Yet movies officially remain celebrated inside festivals, premieres, and award shows, all versions of "banquets and balls". Movies today take the people for granted. They stay alive using childhood memories.

As the luster wears off for Star Wars, it reveals how the people lost their attachment to the nobles. They simply found emotions and memories with new heroes. Leaders like George Washington and Rousseau who said, "Follow me and we'll improve your life with better tools."

And this same change also happened in movies. Today's sequels, remakes, are spectacle movies, and the award shows, performance work is art film. Both keep our interest t with dark majic techniques like effects, celebrities, awards, and mass-marketing. Not surpising this started in the 1970's, which John Wayne described thusly:

>Now the goddamned stock manipulators have taken over. They don't know a goddamned thing about making movies. They make something dirty, and it makes money, and they say, 'Jesus, let's make one a little dirtier, maybe it'll make more money.' And now even the bankers are getting their noses into it.

## Estates General

By 1778, France was in so much in debt, Louis XVI called the "Estate General". A ancient meeting of the "people of the realm". Finally the people cried our voices and pain will be heard. There were three castes. The nobility (400 representatives, 1% of population), the clergy (300 representatives, 1% of population, and the people (800 representatives, 98% of the population).

At question was money. The French government had none. The nobles wanted to raise taxes. The people said what if the nobles and clergy stopped being tax exempt. That's right the rich and powerful didn't pay taxes. The nobles, and (richer) clergy, said why don't we vote on it.

The people said okay, we have more representives, us plus the many priests who lived on the frontline who supported them. The nobles and clergy said

## Charting Storiesss

Here's a legend for the story charts.

![Legend](\../img\breakdowns\story-legend.png)

**Story Organization**
_Old Society_ - The society before the story starts.
_Beginning_ - When the protagonist breaks from society.
_Conclusion_ - The final battle.
_New Society_ - The society after battle.

**Surprises**
_Protagonist philosophy_ - Where the good guy gets his ideas. Where surprising choices come from.
_Antagonist philosophy_ -  Where the bad guy gets his ideas. Where surprising choices come from.
_Free will_ - The time character's have to intrepret his philosophy and do something to win. Small spread is grave danger, big spread is nothing matters, moderate spread is time to think, and a requirement to act.

**Logic/plot**
_The plot_ - The sequence of events. More area means more "logical surprises" are available.
_Build up_ - Long periods when the protagonists suffers, or makes a plan.
_Twist and Turn_ -  When the plot suddenly surprises us and we realize something new.

![Spectacle Story](\../img\breakdowns\story-spectacle.png)
![Functional Story](\../img\breakdowns\story-functional.png)

All stories share the same layers. They just emphasize some over others. Here they are, in their order of importance.

1. Plot: the sequence of reasonable, yet surprising, events between hero and villian. Since whoever controls the tools wins, the plot is usually centered on a tool like the glass slipper in Cinderella, or the One Ring in Lord of the Rings.
2. Protagonist: the person who sees above the ruling philosophy and wants to change the world with a new ruling philosophy. Like Romeo and Juliette bring their families to peace.
3. Ruling philosphy: the antagonist's belief system. The hatred between Capulet's and Montegue's.
4. Antagonist: the person writing the rule book to keep reality the same. Cinderella's step family.
5. Rule book: what people are "officially" allowed to say. Expressed as dialogue in a movie, "Juliette, stay away from Romeo!"; "I love him and I don't care what you say!", but written into laws, regulations, and books in life.
6. Passion: the items people are passionate about, like guitars to a guitarist, or flowers to a romantic.
7. Spectacle: the most visible layer. It's everything we see like clothes, ships, food, explosions, nudity, swords, weapons. Whether props or special effects, these make up the story's typical lifestyle.

Let's see all these layers in a few movies.

## Battle Inside Stories

Let's take a break from Star Wars comparisons for a short while and use another geek story. The Matrix. This story depicts a dystopian future in which most of humanity is unknowingly trapped inside a simulated reality, the Matrix, created by AI machines to distract humans while using their bodies as an energy source. Ne" is recruited to help the few untapped humans rebel against the machines by making the masses inside the Matrix realize their reality is fake.

If you were to look at a good story, here's what you'd see.

![The Matrix](\../img\breakdowns\techvolution-the-matrix-layers.png)

Although increasingly unhappy, the people kept watching the sequels of divine nobility until Rousseau told reminded them everyone starts off equally, thus perpetual heirarchy is bullshit. Until him, the people were too distracted by the spectacle and art of nobles' bad storytelling.

We can sympathize. Become a projectionist and you'll notice most movies today are bad. That's not an opinion, audiences simply don't laugh, cry, and rave much anymore. Yet we still celebrate movie actors as hallowed artists, watch them win awards they give themselves, and pay them millions for their celebrity. Yet, all they do is pretend. It's not that hard. Let them try working insurance.

It's not always their fault. Actors are expected to be award attendees, spokesman, marketers to serve the dark majic of others. Explaining why people like bad stories tells us why the nobles lost their audience and stopped being society's heroes.

## The Road to Techvolution, and the Death of Revolutions

Rousseau changed history by making the people realize they suffered on the frontline because of an old ruling philosophy. Even though French and Americans could read pamplets, newspapers, and books they still couldn't vote. Even though they could use guns to fight for the king's personal glory in wars like The War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714), and The War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748), they weren't allowed to use guns to defend themselve against the king. Even though science starting revealing the truth about Nature, they were told to follow society's religious rules instead. The people's cyborgolgy was held back by Darth King's rules.

The people's demand for change started a revolution, a sudden questioning of a civilization’s ruling philosophy. The American, French and all the other revolutions in the 19th centuries were violent, because the divide between ruling philosophy and frontline society was very wide.

It's a lesson for us. We have to hurry up. Because the longer we wait to update our ruling philosophy to digital tools, the more out of touch the frontline and ruling philosophy gets. The result is needless revolution. All the more reason for a Techvolution now.

Good stories versus bad stories. When I was a projectionist I (and any other) could tell the difference without ever seeing the movie. We just watched the audience's reactions. If they scream, cry, laugh, yell, it's a good story. Even more telling was listening to moviegoers walk out. If they marvelled about twists, turns, and cool lines, you know the story was really good because it turned fiction into reality.

The audience is never wrong. They can't be. Laughing, being surprised, remembering cool lines is not audience's job. They're jobs is only to watch. It's the storytellers job to give its audience emotions and memories.

A story is a sequence of events where a protagonist fights an antagonist to overcome a problem. The fight to change reality happens in three parts. The first is an introduction of problem and characters. The second is the back and forth battle between heroes and villians. The third part is the conclusion, where we find out which side wins.

Stories are thus simply the essential progression of incidents that happen to the hero in pursuit of his one goal. Action scenes, or character performances, are merely spices, only to be added in moderation. Like two boxers adjusting to each other's tactics. Mixing the logic of problem solving, with the surprises of conflict, is how good stories become "logically surprising", and thus fun to watch.

The kind of story doesn't matter. Comedies, dramas, tragedies. As long as the sequence of events is logically surprising, an audience will believe in aliens and space operas, machines and virtual realities, or kings and kingdoms.

Telling the difference between good and bad stories is actually hard. Bad stories can seem legitimate because everything happens in a sequence of events. Since we're living inside a bad story, we need to learn the difference between the bad stories with too much logic, too many surprises, and the good ones with the right mixture of both.

He said the nobility were con artists who hid behind divinity. And equality was natural. He was right, let's really understand why. Equality, and divinity, come and do based no good stories. And survive based on bad stories.

Since we're living inside a bad story, we need to learn the difference between the bad stories with too much logic, too many surprises, and the good ones with the right mixture of both.

**Art:** not about any specific problem. Art films are more about the protagonist, not what problem they overcame or antagonist they defeated. This makes them more like personal journals of "a weirdo growing up " or "suffering through high school". Free from overcoming a problem, and revealing new sides to themselves, art heroes act as they want. The result is very surprising idiosyncractic behavior and storylines with little logic to tie events together. The result is surprising, but illogical, stories.

To maintain interest art stories get weirder and weirder. To fend off critcism, they surround themselves with ever more awards, granduer, and claims of being cultured or being divine. This culture survives by creating superficial social rules for behavior and fashion. Gossip survives as people invariably break these rules and create endless controversy. In Rousseau's time it was liking Beethoven's scandalous music, or not having enough servants.

In our time, you can just watch any entertainment show and count how many time "scandal" or "in fashion" is said.

**Spectacle:** about a obvious problem. Spectacle movies are very logical because the problem is very simple; ie. Godzilla is here, so run like hell and keep running until the movie is over. Since the antagonist is so evil, and the action is so instinctual, there's no room for the protagoinst to reveal new sides of himself and change how the story progresses. The result is logical, but unsuprising, stories.

source of distractions, housing prices....

To maintain interest, spectacle movies keep ramping up props, items, special effects, gore, and rauchiness. They fend off critcism by (falsely) claiming each ramp-up is more popular in mass marketing campaigns. Ex. Most franchise movies, sequels, and remakes.

In our time, you can just watch any infotainment show and count how many time "breaking news" is said.

**Functional:** about a questional problem that divides a rational protagonist and antagonist. Eachs acts to defeat the other, but have time to figure out how. The back and forth storyline give the audience logical surprises, until the conclusion, were we find out if reality will change or not.

Source of equality

There's no way to know which functional stories will reasonate with audiences, but only functional stories can truly reasonate with audiences and become classics. Ex. Cinderella, Romeo and Juliette, The Matrix, Star Wars.

Logic and surprises counter-balance each other. Withholding one makes art films that are often too weird, and withholding the other makes spectacle movies that are often too simple. Functional stories work so well because they mix the two and create "logical surprises". It's why the art/spectacle don't have "spoilers", while we want to "go in fresh" for functional stories. For Techvolusion, and our mission of distributing the power of new tools to the masses, the key difference between stories is their conclusions.


## The Extra's Choice

Now, here's how we apply this Techvolution. Remember we need to empower extras to jump up and decide winners. From their perspective there isn't one story going on, but two people claiming to be society's leaders.

But now, we can help the extras see through bullshit better. Not only can extras use majic to decide which person to support, but she will also know that art and spectacle is a bad sign, while function and equality is a good sign.

Here's how the extras should see their choice. I'll use Sophia as an example again. The fact that Douglass wants to read, while Hugh wanted him not too, means Hugh was Darth Slavery, while Douglass was a Jedi. While Sophia did use majic to tell her to teach Douglass, she fell to the rules of a old ruling philosophy. In addition to majic, the Hugh vs Douglass story had other qualities showcases hero and villian.

Hugh loves never ending hierarchy (represented as a triangle). While, Douglass equality and distributing power (represented as a circle). Hugh lives in a high-society with its own banquet and ball lifestyle, that survives by keeping manual labour in use despite the existence of machinery, education, to do a better job.

And yes, that's the problem we have now, with Darth Blockbuster.

![Sophia's Choice](\../img\diagrams\techvolution-antagonists-protagonists-extras-close-up-douglass.png)

## Our Story

ALl this applies to us too. It's important to note, while Rousseau's followers may have been political free, they were economically poor. Hunger, disease, unemployment, illiteracy, were all rampant. The time was basically "economic anarchy".

Like how society loved the original kings for winning the "King's peace", the original economic kings were heroes for winning massive economic growth. They said follow me, recognize my property rights, let me run the economy, my company's will keep you employed and improve your life with new tools like lightbulbs, and toaster ovens.

Slowly but surely, they did. They told a good story during the Industrial Revolutions. The people were again an audience who watched fiction become reality as we overcame economic anarchy. And we did that with many of the primitive tools of today. Schools, colleges, and universities educated the masses. Gas trucks and cars moved resources and products much faster. Oil and coal powered everything.

Darth Blockbuster's forebears like Andrew Stanton, Andrew Carnegie, Vanderbilt, did what Clovis I and the rest did. And like how Darth King was only exposed when new tools empowered the extras so they didn't need to be peasants anymore, Darth Blockbuster was only revealed when digital tools were so powerful, the extras didn't need to be 9-5 working, consumers anymore.

Our problem today is Darth Blockbuser. He actively chooses to fight against new digital tools changing our way of life. Although we have amazingly powerful new technologies, using these technologies to create new tools is hard. The majic of new digital tools improving everyone's cyborgology is thus rare at home, work, and leisure.

However, prohibiting majic is not Darth Blockbuster's only weapon. He also surrounds himself with art, and distracts the extras with spectacle. Both are bad stories, which require them to ramp up their weirdness, and spectacle, to keep going. The problem solving and equality loving classic stories are put on hold, so that Darth Blockbuster's hold tools can stick around, and keep him in power.

And this same change to art and spectacle started in the 1970's, when digital tools should have been changing our way of life. Here's how John Wayne saw it at the time:

>Now the goddamned stock manipulators have taken over. They don't know a goddamned thing about making movies. They make something dirty, and it makes money, and they say, 'Jesus, let's make one a little dirtier, maybe it'll make more money.' And now even the bankers are getting their noses into it.

The movies kept using ever more spectacle, they turned good stories like Star Wars, Die Hard, Indiana Jones, Predator, Spider-Man, Batman, and so many others, into a never ending list of sequals and remakes, each with higher marketing and production budgest to produce the spectacle that keeps it alive.

The movies, also become ever more artful. When moviemakers weren't selling out to spectacle movies, they compensated for its boring stories, with ever more artful ones. Sundance, Toronto, Cannes and other film festivals celerated films, while the public only watched them walk the red carpet.

This same mixture of spectacle and art expanded through all pre-digital tools in suburbia. Detached homes got ever more spectular, bigger sizes, designer fashion. Cars got bigger, more size, more chrome, more horsepower. Televisions increase in size. All these were used to promote a "Desperate Housewives" suburban lifestyle of drinking win, holding house parties, and being a office worker who didn't do manual labour but talked alot of saving the world via red / blue politics.

All tools that existed pre 1970, grew their spectacle and art to save themselves from being surpassesd by digital tools. Houses didn't come made with solar panels. Cars were not allowed to go electric. Televisions couldn't connect to streaming services. The power of digital tools was withheld from the extras by Darth Blockbuster's majical interference, and with the use of spectualr and artful stories.

And, if we're going to change that, we need to realize all bad stories eventually end badly, so.... shit something is wrong...

## Paramount

Movie theatres struggled because of DVD. Studio's are not allowed to own or even coordinate with movie theatres. It was a rule made in 1948 called the Parmount Consent Degrees. It's the reason why a movie ticket and popcorn are so expensive. Studio's get 80% of the former and theatres live on the latter.

It's also why the studio's loved DVD sales, because they kept most of it themselves.

## Rousseau on Stories

The difference between good stories (classic) and bad stories (art and spectacle) is the difference between magic and dark magic. Good stories attract people themselves, they last forever, and span cultures, because they speak to our natural love of stories and the battle between good and evil.

To keep our interest in bad stories, people use dark magic, non-storytelling methods to keep people interested in art and spectacle stories. Awards, titles, elitist culture or art, and the re-using old icons, names, graphics surrounded by flashy production, of spectacle stories.

There only difference between magic, and majic, is that the the former happens in fictional stories, and the later happens in real life. Notice how much dark majic there is in art films that few people ever watch. Just watch any entertainment award show television coverage and how many time "scandal" or "in fashion" is said, then ask anyone if they saw the films. Few people every do, it's not why their watching.

You can also see the same thing about spectacle and news infotainment. Watch them and you'll see commercials for super-horsepower cars, or prescription drugsfancy new gadgets, and how many time "breaking news" is said with flash letters graphics, dramatic music, and scared faces to understand how these bad stories survive.

## Good and Bad Storiess

Good stories versus bad stories. When I was a projectionist I (and any other) could tell the difference without ever seeing the movie. We just watched the audience's reactions. If they scream, cry, laugh, yell, it's a good story. Even more telling was listening to moviegoers walk out. If they marvelled about twists, turns, and cool lines, you know the story was really good because it turned fiction into reality. Only classic stories every did this.

While some people learn to appreciate art films, and others love the distraction of spectacle, neither created many emotions or raving fans. And they're never wrong. They can't be. Laughing, being surprised, remembering cool lines is not by choice. It's the storytellers job to give its audience new emotions and memories with good stories.

Watching a movie theatre audience is watching the frontline. So when the people rave about art and spectacle stories you know something is wrong. Rousseau was beloved by the people, and hated by the nobility, for noticing the people were raving about spectacle, and thinking the art society was better, instead of being stuck up shitheads.

This was important because one works for equality and democracy, and the other two work to enrich the rich and distract the masses.

## Darth Compact Disc

So let's recap Darth Compact Disc with the above in mind. A new tool let customer's listen to individual songs. Music executive's business model was make two good songs, packaged with 10 fillers, and charged for 12 song CD's.

Internet came. He had no idea what it was, so it was a threat. He sued Napster and won. Internet still a threat. He tries to make a tool from it. Failes. Internet still a threat. Steve Jobs comes to him. Still a threat. Jobs wins anyway.

Darth CD was living a art story. He couldn't solve a problem, making money from the internet, but he didn't want to give up his place as a hero. Thus his story was one of self-importance and complaining about his inability to act. He used spectacle, lawsuits, media interviews, marketing compaigns to try and make CD's stay cool, to try and distract the masses from a better tool.

A hero in a classic story would have let someone else try. Which is what history did, Steve Jobs, and the other people behind iPods, iTunes, and now Spotify.

## Prologue

Yet when I wrote this book I used VS Code, Quora, Wikipedia, Betterworldbooks, and other digital tools for free or just about. When I needed some editing help and cool illustrations it was a click away on 99 Designs and Upwork. No meetings, no resumes, no office politics. I told people my problem, used chat, email, Figma and Word, and boom, like magic, world class drawings and a book that is far more readable. Best yet, I'm not their boss but collaborator.

And I literally live next to a college specializing in creative writing and illustration. Yet the digital economy is easier and cheaper then trying to work with them. They're filled with adminstrators, bureaucrats, and teachers who live to delegate work.

    As a kid I helped my family clean office buildings, warehouses, and factories. My job was to pick up garbages and blueboxes. A simple job I got done before reading PC Gamer. Blue collar people usually cleaned up after themselves. Offices not so much. They didn't like "working beneath them".

    Later on, when I was the working in warehouses, factories, and offices, I saw the same thing. In one office job the cleaners were short staffed. Layers of management spent hours in meetings and eventually emailed out this:

    >We are working through some issues with our office garbage pickup. As a result some of our bins have not been emptied. If you see that the bin is full, please refrain from adding more to the bin. Thank you for your patience. I am working on getting this resolved.

    At nine I had the problem figured out.

    Funny until you realize people who _want_ to delegate work control huge parts of our economy. They like old technology because it gives them the stream of problems they get to manage. And they know digital tools threaten their status.

    Another big motivation for me to write this was it pisses me off red/blue politics seeps into your political conversations and thoughts.

Those philosophies are very old. That's why their supporters yell so much. Ignorant about digital tools solve problems, they keep people interested by giving them drama. What the middle class needs is to become their own heroes with new tools. Ways to understand how their taxes work, analyze why there's so many regulations, and protect their data from being sold to the highest bidder.

## Star Fleet

Here's the breakdown. In the first drawing I wanted the show what happens when humans change their perception because of new tools. With the telescope we saw the Earth moves,and we digital tools we'll see our obession with self-gratification.

So for example, car insurance claim adjusters are often by lied to by bad drivers who swear "the light was green!". With only the liars word to go by, the worker is forced to appease them. But with new tools like dashboard cameras, the truth isn't a person's opinion, but something everyone can see with their own eyes. Hence why the "customer service representative" is discarding the mask and holding the cards.

I'm starting conceptualize the article now, and changed from talking about what new world we'll see with digital tools, to what new world we'll build. So the article is now called "Starting Starfleet".

In summary, I think once we're freed of rampant self-gratication, we'll supercharge people like Elon Musk to build the future, which I'm saying is how "Starfleet" actually starts, and hence what we'll see in the future is ourselves in the stars.

Everything in the image can stay the same. Luckily Star Trek  often showed people playing cards. I just need the image to be wearing a Star Trek uniform, and looking back at us saying "hurry up, the future is so much fun".

## Prologue jpm story

Here's an example of it. As a kid I helped my family clean office buildings, warehouses, and factories. My job was to pick up garbages and blueboxes. A simple job I got done before running off to read PC Gamer or Maximum PC. Blue collar people usually kept a clean workspace. Offices not so much. Salesman, supervisors, and executives insisted on lived on image, and didn't like doing anything "beneath" their position.

Later on, when I was the working in warehouses, factories, and offices, I saw the same thing. In one office job, cleaners were in short supply. Layers of management stared at full garbage bins, spent hours in meetings, and eventually emailed out this:

>We are working through some issues with our office garbage pickup. As a result some of our bins have not been emptied. If you see that the bin is full, please refrain from adding more to the bin. Thank you for your patience. We are working on getting this resolved.

# Prologue Original

I wrote this for the people on GitHub, Bitbucket, Slack, Figma, Sketch, and whatever else you Jedi are working on. Learning the ecosystem of your tools was super cool. Learning your unspoken philosophy was even cooler.

Most people don’t yet know the power of digital tools. It’s too different, like an animal inside a different ecosystem. The fact any person can visit GitHub, go to the Ruby on Rails site, and download it for free is like owning your own newspaper. Not only that, the fact you can see the people who are working on it, what every person did, and when, and even contribute your own help, is a world as different as Cinderella walking into the banquet because she wanted to, not because a fairy said so could.

Open source still can’t run the world. Read The _Innovators_ and Walker Isaacson will explain how the trifecta of academic institutions, private corporations, and the military was perfect to create the digital revolution. Likewise, it was for profit companies, academic institutions, and open-source programmers who kept it going.

But open-source the next step in human evolution. It’s so pivotal because it’s a check and balance to anyone trying to control too much. Darth Blockbuster literally couldn’t stop a few hackers from giving the world internet streaming. A upgrade that’ll we’ll see in the next book actually saved tens of millions of dollars and a few hundred lives (in short, less car accidents).

Even cooler with open-source, work is tracked, ideas are debated, results are shared. Some people are dicks for sure, but nobody thinks they’re a king. People work when and where the want, and we all get and give better results because of it. No uniform requirements. No “BEEP-BEEP” of bell. No boss trying to keep his job relevant with some bullshit marketing meaning. It’s not perfect. Shit happens. But try working elsewhere on the frontline and you’ll see a big difference.

Open-source is the new world. One that I only wanted to learn about. Now I want to liberate. There’s no difference between the soldiers who fought Darth King Charles, George III, or Louis XVI and you, the modern minuteman who doesn’t work for money, but to advance human evolution.

You all feel the “majic” of new tools, yet have a hard time explaining to regular people, because humanity still doesn’t really understand how our “cyborgology” changes us every time we pick up a radio, a smartphone, a lightsaber (one day!).

Another big motivation for me to write this was it pisses me off red / blue politics seeps into your political conversations and thoughts. Those philosophies are older then Cobol, and worth nothing to anyone building the future. They want to keep people watching the news, rather than living their own story. For anyone to become their own hero, they need tools. Way to understand how their taxes work, analyze which politician is voting for what bills, and protect their data from being sold to the highest bidder.

My hope is that with Techvolution, you can better explain why open-source is making the world a better place to extras wondering why you work so hard making Deno, Node modules, Common Voice, or the endless projects piecing together a brighter future like so many Wikipedia articles, one edit now at a time. Terms like “Darth Blockbuster”, “Death Star rule book”, “internet Jedi”, and soon to come “Life Star” put the world in a black and white way, not based on color, but which person gives the people tools to live a better life. Which person fights to let them use tools to improve their lives.

Avoid the red/blue philosophies. They march like its Woodstock in in 1969, because technologically speaking they never want us to move passed 1969. The power of digital tools is completely unseen to them. You could transfer them back in time and they wouldn’t notice. Gas cars, broadcast televisions, 9-5 work days, two car garages homes, retirement savings; their ideal way of life is a never ending The Simpsons episode. Red/blue, equally and without difference, are now self-entitled characters in an art film living a life of banquets and balls.

There are many Darth Blockbuster’s in this class of artists. They live by inheriting the control of DVD stores, accounting companies, insurance brokers, bureaucratic office jobs, and the like. They write rules to stop the hierarchy of old tools sending them back to equality. They do so with the outmost sincerity and conviction that they’re the “martyrs of the people”. The power of digital tools is as lost to them as books, guns, and telescopes was to Darth King. It’s too bad. They’re usually very well-intentioned people, but they’re just way behind the times.

The people are distracted like fans of an old sitcom to notice we don’t get tools to solve our problems. We’re so use to seeing the same political family names, cable news shows, 60 Minute interviews, gas car product logos, to notice our story isn’t a classic one with people overcoming problems anymore.

The aim is simple. When you're talking about your job to a regular person, I want you to be able to say to "I am empowering you with new tools to help you live a better life" with a well deserved confident smile" then adding "and _they_ are holding you back". And if they question who and why, just tell them to read _Techvolution_.

- crowdsourcing
- community forums

- so people keep using his old tools like CD's, DVDs, road maps, lecture halls, gas cars, paper forms, and call-centers because he owns these tools, he profits from these tools, and he has no idea what Javascript is, so he never wants his users to leave and send him back to equality.
- I'm one of them. I'm a lone politics, history, and philosophy geek who spends his days thinking about what's coming next in the story of civilization. With Firefox, Project Gutenberg, YouTube, and Wikipedia I can do my own research. With Markdown, VS Code, and Ghost I can write, design, and host my own work. With Word and Figma I can collaborate with world-class illustrators and writers to make it better. This book is a byproduct of your own ecosystem.
- Open-source isn't perfect. People are dicks, projects die off, politics gets involved. But that's humanity. Open-source works because it gives us freedom, which is the only way human virtues like accountability, ingenuity, and work-ethic flourish.

## Prologue PC Gamer

I helped clean office buildings as kid. Kind of, I just picked up the garbages and blue-bins before reading PC Gamer. Years later when working at a big office, the cleaners were short staffed. Management spent many hours meeting about the "garbage problem". It was funny, if it wasn't another example of the bad story of modern management addiction to petty problems.

Using today's software and open-source philosophy work becomes a good story. People are free to come and go, so each project has to have a clear purpose. All problems, communication, and contributions are in the open, peole can assess where their character is best needed. Free, empowered, peope work have made made tools like Firefox, Linux, and Wikipedia.

## Tesla 

<!-- include this? -->
  Darth Blockbuster is in control. He's dedicated to keeping control. And he's no protagonist. He can't be a hero, because unlike Neo, Cinderella, Romeo and Juliette he's not mentally capable of rising above the situation, and seeing a solution to what he thinks is a fact of life. Cars break down, deal with it. And when someone asks him to solve the problem, his face goes blank. He can't pass that question on the test. He can't run fast enough to make the team. He can't throw a spiral. So his dad comes over and asks the coach to do him a favor on put him on the team anyway. That favour is the rules Darth Blockbuster asks government, corporations, and culture to keep the extras using old tools.

  That's why a small company like Tesla had to bring modern cars to America. They didn't have early access to new technology, different tools, a magic wans. Tesls is run by people who _can_ see problems. They can answer that question on the test, they can run fast enough, they can throw a spiral. So they're father sits proudly in the seats. Darth Blockbuster should be beside him. Yet, he gets to be captain because he pays for it.

## Sample Intro addition

If you don’t like the choir, or you’re starting to realize the “other side” consists of workers like you and that they are a part of the same struggling middle class, you’d probably like to keep reading. Red and blue philosophies may consider you an extra , who’s supposed to read the opinions of columnists, listen to pundits, and vote every few years. But digital tools give everyone the power move from being a TV watching extra, to a hero to be reckoned with.

I want to give you an aha moment. That instead of thinking politics being something you watch, with digital tools and open-source technology and practices, it’s something you can join in and control. Because like in any story, once you’re holding a tool to fight climate change, government waste or any other cause, you’re no longer an extra watching other decide the stories outcome, but the hero making the world a better place.

To participate in politics means embracing the power of digital tools. Which also means accepting that whichever color wins an election this year or the next and re-writes the rules, regular people will still pay taxes, have a huge mortgage, waste hours in traffic, pay increasing energy bills, sleep less than they’re supposed to, buy unhealthy food, watch climate change, overpay for questionable education, get confused by their health insurance, endure customer abuse, work unpaid overtime, get micro-managed by an increasing number of managers, be told by ignorant consultants how to do their work, and hope their job (which they likely hate) isn’t downsized or outsourced.


These people have changed our reality. They are strongly bent on solving real-world problems with technology. They hate the “busy work” of aimless marketing meetings, useless PowerPoint presentations about the “garbage problem,” and confinements within outdated technology because “that’s what the boss knows.” My goal is to help rid our society of old philosophies that hold back the vision of these creators and contributors. My mission is to let you protagonists prosper.

Prosper by removing antagonists in their way, and by filling their ranks with regular middle class people like you. I want to give you an aha moment. That heroic moment like in so many movies when a person realizes only they can improve their lives by stepping up and getting involved. That moment comes when regular people realize with open-source and digital tools, their political power is not in the remote controller deciding which infotainment show to watch. It’s in the smartphone deciding which digital product you’re going to use, fund, or help make.

## Weight Cutting

My only skill that might step me apart to talk about things like ruling philosophies is being damn stubborn yet also incisive. Here’s an example. When I was learning about the sport of Mixed Martial Arts in 2005 a friend told me about “weight-cutting”. MMA fighters are separated by weight and each fighter weighs in about 36 hours before their fight. Fighters dehydrate themselves for their weigh in, and then rehydrate. Weight cutting lets fighters weigh in at 170 on Friday, but fight at 190 pounds for example. It’s sanctioned cheating that’s allowed because the practice has been around for so long it’s considered part of the sport.

But it’s not. Like diving in soccer, weight cutting at first was harmless. It slowly crept into the combat sports over decades. But after decades of using it and watching it, it’s as accepted as gloves, shorts, and spit buckets. It took me all of one second to realize weight cutting was a cancer. All from one comment I overheard my gym teacher say years earlier when the class was weighing ourselves. He said in wrestling his teammates used to make weight by dropping to their underwear. They were trying to gain every advantage, as MMA fighters did.

Most people can’t see through culture easily. The reason to weigh fighters is so they’re equal size. Fighting didn’t start with and is not about who’s the best weight-cutter. Yet it exists nonetheless because most people take what’s given. So MMA fans watch fighters nearly dead walk to “make weight” one day before a cage match. I can’t do math in my head, I can’t read music, I can’t be a professional fighter, but I can tell the bullshit from the reason pretty well.

## Summary

We've come quite a way in the story so far. So let's take a minute and recap what we need to know. I'm going do this with three stories.

The first is from a BBC Earth documentary. Most people know lions hunt together and take down large animals with teamwork while cheetahs use pure speed to run down small prey by themselves. The BBC documentary showed some cheetah's have learned to hunt in groups to take down large animals. Like the audience, their new large prey, particularly ostrich's, are surprised by the new development. The ostrich's pay with their lives because they still don't see cheetahs as a threat. The moral of the story is either the ostrich's will learn or slowly die off.

Onto the next story. Race car driving use to be extremely dangerous. In the 1940's and 50's cars were blazingly fast but incredibly dangerous because nobody knew how to keep them on the road. Centre of gravities were high and the cars would often spin out of control. For example, the 1955 Le Mans race accident killed 83 spectacators when a car engine flew into the stands.

In 1956 a race car driver and engineer named Michael May thought of a solution. He put a giant wing on top of his Porsche race car. It created huge downforce, giving his car far more grip to stay on the road. His better handling won him his first race with a car that was much safer. Seems like a win win doesn't it. Except Porche's factory team got Michael's innovation declared against the rules. It wasn't until 1963 that wings came back into racing, and by the 1970's downforce was heavily studied science in car racing mimicked today with "spoilers" on many performance cars.

Now for the last story. Humanity has many martial arts. Karate, kickboxing, wrestling, jiu-jitsu, judo, and boxing being among the most common today. Each of these disciplines use the same human body, but teach certain techniques like punching or choke-holds to defeat their opponents. When competing each discipline creates rules that say only their techniques are allowed; there's no kicking in a boxing match for example.

In the early 1990's the fight community started to ask whose system system was best: would a boxer beat a kickboxer? What would happen if a wrestler fought a karate guy? What these people were asking is what if we threw away the rule book and just fought a fight.

On reflection, it seems funny that this was an original idea, but before the 1990's people just assumed boxers or wrestlers weren't allowed to fight outside their rulebook. Fighters were supposed to be ideological loyal and pure to their discipline, even if getting their ass kicked in a real fight.

So the fight community threw out all their rulebooks held many "no rules" tournaments; the most popular being the Ultimate Fighting Championship. After several years these tournaments found their answer. No martial art was the best. Meaning the best fighters were ones who trained all disciplines and used whatever technique they thought would defeat their opponent based on the exact moment they were fighting them. A large toolbox of techniques and the open mind to adapt as fast as possible proved to be the best system. This realization was the start of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA). It's so effective its practioners will defeat any other kind of fighter.

Here's what we should take from these three stories. The middle-class has many systematic problems that keep getting worse. Today we often decide our politician based on their "red", "blue", "green" or whatever ideology. And this is why we're getting our asses kicked.

Because we believe in one ideology, we think our lives are governed by the ideological rule book. Even though all of today's ideologies centuries ago. The answer to what's best is "mixed ideological politics". Meaning not having loyalty to one ideology, but to only care about problem-solving.

That's what Techvolution is. It's a rebellion inside your mind that realizes you are a lifeform in Nature, and thus no rule apply except those that help you solve practical everyday problems. Humans evolve with tools, so your job is to solve frontline pain to evolve life on Earth. And when someone says you're not allowed you have to fight back, even if only in your mind, because they are just being assholes. 


That's why Techvolution is. Is the rebellion inside your mind that says life isn't a ideological fight anymore than a streetfight is a boxing match. The truth is all lifeforms are free to use whatever means neccesary to win in Nature. Thus no rules apply that don't help you live a better life. Since humanity evolves with tools, new tools should be protected and allowed to prospser based on how valuable the people no involved, the extras, find them. Until Techvolution is our ruling philosophy, our society will keep supressing new ideas like a spoiler on racing car, and end up being like ostrichs running away instead of evolving a solution.

## Summary 2

We've come some way in the story Stargazer. So let's take a minute and recap what we need to know. I'm going do this with three stories.

The first is from a BBC Earth documentary. Most people know lions hunt together in prides and take down large animals with teamwork while cheetahs instead use pure speed to catch small prey by themselves. Well, some cheetah's have learned to hunt in groups to take down large animals.Their new large prey, particularly ostrich's, are surprised by the adaptation. The ostrichs are paying with their lives because they still don't see cheetahs as a threat. The moral of the story is either the ostriches will learn or slowly die off.

Onto the next story. Race car driving used to be extremely dangerous. In the 1940's and 50's cars were blazingly fast but nobody knew how to keep them on the road. Centre of gravities were high and the cars would often spin out of control. For example, in the 1955 Le Mans race, 83 spectacators died when a car flew into the stands after a crash. Car racing was banned in several countries because of the disaster.

In 1956 a race car driver and engineer named Michael May thought of a solution. He put a big wing on top of his Porsche race car and pointed it down. The downforce gave his car far more grip to stay on the road. His better handling won him his first race with a car that was much safer. Seems like a "win win" doesn't it. Except Porche's factory team got Michael's innovation declared against the rules. The attack on innovation worked until 1963 when another driver bucked the rules and used the wing again. By the 1970's downforce was heavily studied science in car racing, becoming so iconic it's mimicked today with "spoilers" on performance road cars.

Now for the last story. Humanity has many martial arts: karate, kickboxing, wrestling, jiu-jitsu, judo, and boxing being among the most common today. Each of these disciplines use the same human body but teach certain techniques like punching or choke-holds to defeat their opponents. Each discipline creates rules so only their techniques are allowed in competitions; there's no kicking in a boxing match for example.

In the early 1990's the fight community started to ask whose martial art would win a real fight. On reflection, it seems funny that this was an original idea, but before the 1990's people just assumed boxers or wrestlers weren't allowed to fight outside their rulebook. Fighters were supposed to be ideologically loyal to their discipline, even if getting their ass kicked in a real fight.

After hosting many "no rules" tournaments, the most popular being the Ultimate Fighting Championship, the fight community found the best martial art. None of them. Or, all of them. Meaning the best fighters were ones who trained all disciplines and used whatever technique they thought would defeat their opponent based on the exact moment they were fighting them. A large toolbox of techniques and an open mind to adapt proved to be the best martial art. This realization was the start of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) which is so effective its practioners will defeat any other fighter.

Here's what we should remember from these three stories. The middle-class has many systematic problems. Today we think a red or blue ideology will solve them. We fight each other with arguments of "free-market" versus "government regulation" with honest intentions of improving the world. We even elect and evaluate our government representatives based on ideological purity; not how effectively they helped solve our real-world problems.

And this is why the middle class keeps getting our asses kicked. Because we care about rule books and not results. But Nature doesn't care about rule books. It cares about quick adaptions. The cheetah's learned that, the ostriches are trying to, and we learned it when realizing MMA is the best martial art.

That's what Techvolution is. It's a rebellion inside your mind that says life isn't a ideological fight anymore than a streetfight is a boxing match. That doesn't mean we burn all past knowledge. MMA fighters can still learn from kickboxers. Likewise, red/blue ideologies can teach us things the same way ancient philosophies and religions can. But none of them should be the ruling philosophy when working or electing a government.

Only results should be. And to see results we have to use digital tools to transform our entire way of life. That means Techvolution.

Human life won't be a utopia with Techvolution as a ruling philosophy. Evolution is hard work. It requires feeling frontline pain and finding a solution with a new adaptation. But once we're free to do that, in our mind and in society, we'll start to actually see results. And to boot, work will mimick open-source; being less about delegators and garbage meetings, and more about workers and contributions.

Ideologues often scream out "socialist" or "intolerant" to re-inforce their beliefs. We should still ignore this marching band, but we can still learn something from them. We've all seen antagonists not allow telecommuting, force workers to use old tools they understand, or spend hours on garbage meetings. Until we start to call out "Darth Blockbuster" problem solving innovations, even simple ones like spoilers on racing cars, will keep being suppressed by the Sith's Death Star rule book. Meaning middle-class problems will pile-up like ostrichs getting caught by cheetahs. Except it'll be our heads in the sand.

To win the war Stagazer, we have to blow the Death Star.

## The Power of Philosophies Is Either to Hold Us Back or Push Us Forward

Why must philosophies be revamped? Let me explain with a little more history. Our philosophies can only be as good as what we can prove. Of course, philosophers can debate and argue all day long about whatever they want; they aren’t on the frontline trying to make a living as a fisherman, seamstress, or welder. The people need a ruling philosophy to organize their daily lives, and for everyone to believe in a philosophy, it must make sense to everyone and help them live a better life.

Thus, when in ancient Greece Aristarchus of Samos said the Earth moved around the Sun nobody believed him. Instead they believed Aristotle who said the Earth stood still. A moving Sun made more sense to people, because for one, it looks like it moves, and two if the Earth moves, why can’t we see the stars move their position in the sky. The answer that they’re extremely far away is impossible to see with the eye, and nearly impossible to imagine. Thus, the average person sided with Aristotle because he made more sense. Especially because back then people navigated by the stars, and it’s easier to assume the Earth is stationary when doing so. Even today’s nautical maps are based on a motionless Earth.

Of course, everything changed when Galileo invented the telescope during the Renaissance. Although since rich and powerful were followers of Aristotle and refused to look threw it, the telescope let everyone else see, and therefore believe, the Earth moves. As the telescope got better and cheaper, society’s ruling philosophy switched from the “geo-centrism” of Aristotle, to the “helio-centrism” of Aristarchus.

You might scoff at people who refused to accept the Earth moves. But that’s the difference new tools have on our ruling philosophy. Whatever philosophy makes sense to most people gets their support; especially when it also improves their lives. Helio-centrism made more sense to telescope empowered people, and it improved daily life with better calendars, mathematics, and physics. Thus, the people used it as their ruling philosophy. The lesson is we update our philosophy to the capabilities of new tools.

In 2019, we have the same problem. The telescope showed us a dazzling universe. Now we’re no longer happy to just look at it. We want to explore it. But space travel isn’t just cool; it’s a vital next step in humanity’s evolution. Reaching for the stars means better satellites, worldwide internet accessibility, and ensuring intelligent life doesn’t put all its eggs in our one earthly basket. Getting off the planet requires an affordable lift-off.

It was private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin (funded by a few rich guys) who answered the call and constructed some relatively cheap rockets. To make them cheap enough to change the course of human history, these rockets also had to be reusable. This was no small feat, especially for SpaceX; their Falcon 9 rockets were seven stories high and would have to launch into space, land back on Earth, and relaunch all over again.

SpaceX tried several times and kept failing. But on December 22nd, 2015, they did it! They succeeded in the incredible achievement of landing a rocket. This was hailed as one of humanity’s greatest milestones by SpaceX’s fans who realize the importance of advancing technology. But many people, especially politicians, didn’t care.

When you’re obsessed with old philosophies, you’re also confined to its old tools and lived within its old narratives. Today the red/blue philosophy obsesses over tax cuts, government regulations, and media soundbites because those are the tools their philosophy says to fight over. New and super-powerful technologies like SpaceX are just a novelty act that fall beyond the practitioners of old philosophies comprehension and comfort zones. Like the telescope was to the followers of Aristotle.

That’s the power of a ruling philosophy. It filters out the good and bad for people in everyday life. But we need to update the ruling philosophy when new tools change how everyday people live their life. Today, we need a new philosophy that harnesses our new innovative and powerful digital tools so we can improve life on, and beyond, Earth.

## Terms of Reading

There are none. I don't know which license to use yet, but it'll be an open-source one. I don't have any trackers or website counters. My way to tell if this book is being read, is if our politics transforms to be about who contributed to fighting climate change or increasing social capital more as tracked and verified by open-source software, instead of yelling matches and sob stories about whose to blame for humanity's problems.

If I helped bring about that transformation, then I'm happy.

I would ask to read with an open mind. The future isn't going to bring along all of our current philosophies, ideals, opinions and gripes about the past. There's isn't room to pack things like "colonialization is to blame", or "those damn communists ruined everything with the New Deal". Let our descendants debate those questions if they're so important.
I'm more worried about packing our descendants a better planet to take into the future. That means people today are going to be, one way or another, shedding lots of baggage. People only think it's important to pack all our histories, languages, customs, and traditions because we don't realize our power to decide what we should bring.

If you're loyal to your way of life, that's fine, then show how it contributed more to earn your loyalty to get an outsiders respect.

All of us are too use to taking the way of life we've been given. Yet there's no monarchs, tyrants, devils to blame for our problems anymore. Digital tools gives the people the power to decide our fates. And with power comes responsibility because we can't blame the past for the world we give the future.

So there's no terms to reading. No number is high enough to compensate for the better future we threw away unless Techvolution, or something similar or better, replaces our ruling philosophy.

## Things Won't Get Better, Until

Most of our problems started in the 1970s for a reason. That’s when protagonists created digital tools, and Darth Blockbuster showed up with his Death Star to keep our Woodstock era way of life unchanged. Despite a plethora of new tools, the "American Dream" is still to live in a post-World War II baby boomer suburb.

I'm going to keep repeating this because it's so easy to forget; better tools are out there. We'd majically connect with them to solve our problems if we didn't believe in old philosophies that said their old tools like gas cars and The Oscars were our (supposed) culture, or if new tools weren't against "the rules".

Look at education. We kill ourselves to be admitted into colleges and universities. We use up years of our young lives wrapped in coursework. Our politics uses up so much attention with funding, subsidies, loan agreements, teacher strikes, school shutdowns. And yet at after graduation so many media studies, English, and yes even political science grads never look at their courework again.

All the while Wikipedia, YouTube, Khan Academy, Udemy, Skillshare, Curiosity Stream, Brilliant, Project Gutenberg, The Great Courses, do wonderful jobs while costing a tiny fraction of formal education. Yet, we don’t teach kids to read or update Wikipedia in schools. We don’t track student progress in Khan Academy’s micro-lessons. We don’t recognize "degrees" from Udemy, or YouTube, even though most computer programmers and designers learn far more there than in any college classroom. Yet we assume a stamp of university "graduate" is like getting a perpetual ticket to the ball as a member of some sort of royalty.

Those balls only last so long. Eventually the tools we use have to help us live a more efficient life. I used digital tools to write this book and never once looked back at my university lecture notes. Not out of malice, there's much knowledge there, but reading through notes scribbled on paper takes too long, so despite spending all those years writing, that knowledge is slowly fading away.

This mix match between available tools, and the ones we use in everyday life is a major problem. We aren't adapting but stagnating. Like the poor polar bears unable to foresee the Artic's ice decline, the more we wait to adapt, the more time we'll have to make up until we're basically be like polar bears trying to live in the Amazon.

Our society suffers keeping the old philosophies of the baby-boomer suburban dream alive. Despite way too much carbon in the atmosphere, gridlocked roads, housing bubble bursts, massive student debt, our politics keeps us using gas cars, mass produced homes with no solar panels, super-expensive college education, and very confusing health insurance. Our entire frickin climate is changing because our ruling philosophy is not.

Things like middle class quality of life, political cooperation, and climate change, won’t get better until the extras join the protagonists, step-up to the antagonists, and freely use digital tools to solve frontline problems. To change our cyborgology, we need Techvolution. Without it, we have a mix-match using tools with basically be polar bears trying to survive in the Amazon.

## IDK random

Digital tools were a totally new tool. One that the ruling philosophy didn't know how to handle. It was in the 1970’s Darth Blockbuster showed up and started making his Death Star.

Writing contracts nobody can understand, regulations nobody can find, and enforced politically correctness nobody likes. Despite a three million perfect increase in computer power, our society has more traffic on our roads, we drive more miles every year, we see our friends and families less and less, we have less trust in government every year, and our carbon emissions are so high the planet is actually burning.

All of this is because we can't adapt solutions to these problems because it's against the rules. Our old philosophies, who ignore the possibilies of digital tools, blame each other. Look at this graphic below and notice how the divine between red and blue started in the the 1970's, and as our problems multiply, has only gotten worse.

## Soulful Connections

I think first dates are amazing. Even the generic dinner and movie ones are wondrous. Sitting there in your nice sweater, eating a medium steak, sipping water, and across from your maybe Romeo or Juliette. In a few days, you might use your soul to prevent even a frown on this stranger's heavenly face. Such is the power of romances.

This date moment might in fact end with a five year divorce with true accusations of infidelity where you eat beans for breakfast, bitters for lunch and dinner, and see your kids once a week; your own offspring thinking you're a stranger because of this demon. Such is the power of tragedies.

In truth, most stories are somewhere in between these two extremes; but that's beside the point. The point is every story starts with a connection. If human life is a tapestry of stories, both grand and small, we have to understand how we make and keep people connected to their stories.

It's question of reason. A connection is made when a story is held in a story that's unexpected enough to be interesting, yet reasonable enough to be understood. People, viewers, readers, don't have to be conscious of every element. A good story takes a person over. That's why we often loose ourselves to a romance or a tragedy.

So to get someone connected to a story, we must make them happy. Easy enough. Everyone likes happiness.

That's easy to know, hard to achieve. Your Juliette could think your a loser. Your Romeo might be ignoring your text messages. The point is we can't make happiness, we can't force a connection. Happiness in a fictional story is a magical connection between you, and the story. Happiness in life, is a majical connection between you and your friends, family, job, products, leader, and society, that forces a person to stay inside a story.

Happy stories are wonderful, it's why people seek them out, but in fictional stories of first dates, and real ones too. So the question is, are you happy with your story Stargazer?

I don't ask because I care—I do of course—I ask because it's important. You are the audience of the today's society. If you don't like it, that only means society is edging towards not a beautiful romance, but a awful tragedy.

## A World Without Majic

Stargazer, let's recap your mission. We have to fight for Techvolution, first and foremost in your head. Techvolution says the most important political right and responsibility is to use digital tools to solve your frontline problems without anyone getting in your way. The open-source community gives us the ability to make our own products.

Because humanity isn't perfect, we need to make rules from the ruling philosophy to organize society. People with the power to make the rules, sometimes use their power to make-up rules that benefit their self-interest, for which we call them Darth Blockbuster, and we call his fake rule book the Death Star because it gets in the way of humanity's natural evolution.

For the middle-class to prosper once again, we must blow up this Death Star. To find it we learned about majic; which is the natural yearning to learn and teach new tools and add them to our cyborgology. If we feel majic, we know no rule in its way is just, and therefore must be part of the Death Star we're out to destroy.

Therefore the Death Star and your happiness are opposites. The unhappier you are, the less humanity is adapting, and therefore the more of a Death Star there must be around you. The happier you are, the less of a Death Star there is, because humanity is evolving. Your happiness isn't the flashy products, awards, or recognition, those are cool but only give temporary smiles. You happiness is the freedom to adapt. Basically life without a Death Star is a rational one, where stresses are practicl problems all lifeforms understand like finding water supplies or shelter. With the Death Star life is being forced to do stupid things like commuting two hours to work, or pretend to be interested in a five hour garbage meeting.

So that's our mission then is to destroy today's Death Star. How big do you think it is?

let's recap your mission. You have to promote human evolution, which means  using new and better tools on the frontline at home and at work. This is especially important because our politics is distracted fighting over old tools like regulations and tax codes, leaving old industries to defend against the digital revolution by making digital tools against the rules, which we call the Death Star because it holds back evolution. Majic, a cheeky way of saying the natural love to learn and spread new tools is the counterforce to the rules. We follow the rules to be safe, we follow majic to be happy. Thus to blow up the Death Star, means to increase your happiness on the frontline solving your problems as you see fit.

## Civil War Stats

And the world is worth fighting for. There's so much good going on. Our hectic lifestyles can and infotainment can make it seem like all is lost. Disregard that bullshit. The world is getting better.

For one, it's very safe to live today. The amount of us dying violent deaths has consistently decreased. In the Stone Age, about 10-20% of people died violently, most often by murder. In Rome’s peak civilization it was around 2-5%. In the Dark Ages it was above 5%. But by the 18th century, when the Industrial Revolution started, it went well under 5%. Now, less than 1% of us die violently. All those figures are worldwide and include wars. Poverty reduction is down too. In 1990 36% of the world lived in extreme poverty. In 2015 it was 9.9%. With similar trends, we're eliminating illiteracy, diseases, and hunger throughout the world.

More good news. Digital tools keep getting more powerful too. Look at microchips, the "brains" of a computer. In 1972, we could put 3,000 transistors on a microchip. In 2018 we put 10 billion. In 46 years, we’ve increase computer power by three million percent.

These are just a snippet of a mountain of great news so many hard working scientists, craftsman, volunteers fight for every day. All these positive indicators are Techvolution's Life Star, we'll get to meet later on.

Now for the bad news. Despite a three million perfect increase in computer power, our society has more traffic on our roads, we work longer hours, cost of living is up, we see our friends and families less, we have less trust in government. Overusing these old tools is emitting so much carbon emissions our planet is burning. All this started in the 1970's, when human evolution to the possibilities of new tools was held back by the antagonists.

1**GRAPHS**

Here's the worst trend. Despite all the good trends, our problems won't get better because they're caused by our politics. Our official political ideologies are stuck in a blame fest. They're like a pre-MMA boxer or wrestler, who can't understand their ideological rulebook isn't the only game in town, and thus they blame the other side for "cheating" or "being ignorant" instead of embracing the evolution mantra "admit defeat and learn", something they could do with mixed philosophy politics. Instead they dig their heels in and chance political collapse and civil war.

Blue red hatred - Congress

Since the 1970's red and blue increasingly hate each other. Note, the red and blue color code for progressives and conservaties changes in USA, Canada, Austrialia, United Kingdom, but the trend is the same.

As a quick aside, this is a fucking horrible trend. Two halves blaming each other when they're both equally at fault is edging us towards political breakdown and civil war. Perhaps a bit dramatic, but what other choices do commited ideologue's have; realize their errors and apologize for the past thirty years of mud-slinging, or dig in their heels and fight it out.

## ~~Revolution~~ Techvolution

Stargazer, you look disappointed. You think revolutions are fun. You want to follow _Les Misérables_ and march in the streets. Maybe we should. You get the bristol boards, I’ll get the paint, and we’ll change the world! Free college education! Less bank regulations! Affordable health insurance! Continuous tax cuts! We’ll save the planet _and_ the government’s credit rating!

Listen to me. When your cars breaks down, you call a mechanic for help, right? If he showed up with no tools, you’d get mad. You wouldn't ask his reasons for not bringing tools, nor would you discuss the weather with him. You needed "Mike the mechanic" to show up and solve your problem. Without the tools he's just "Mike the person", and frankly useless to you.

Middle class people have a host of problems like increasing insurance, prescription drug, and tutoring bills. You need solutions. When someone says they can help, you must ask what tool they have, or will give you, that will help. Anything else is smoke and mirrors. You don’t need to see regulations, laws, or blog posts anymore then you need to see the mechanic’s favorite car repair manual. You need tools.

Red/blue philosophies show up with no tools. Not because red/blue leaders and supporters don’t care. But because their philosophies don’t know better. Stuck on old tools, they tell the middle class to walk to the nearest gas station and hope for help, and they promptly blame the opposing political party when we complain.

That’s not horrible, until you consider that with a new digital car, like a Tesla, our broken cars can now call the mechanic, give him a diagnostic to his smartphone immediately, and he’d be able to tell what the problem is, and most importantly, tell the scared person the side of the road, what to do next.

Now consider it’s often against the rules to solve our problems so simply. Patent laws, insurance regulations, nondisclosure agreements, non-compete clauses; a mountain of rules any antagonist can search through so he can force us to keep walking to gas stations.

We must realize how much new digital tools help. Here’s an exercise to do it. Every time you want to watch a Netflix show or YouTube video, get in your car, drive five miles, wait 10 minutes, throw away six bucks, drive back home, and then press play. Watch the movie and do it again within 24 hours or get charged a late fee. Easy to forget, but that’s what renting videocassettes and DVDs was like.

Netflix was a big victory. But a rare one. Today, how we pay taxes, recognize education, repair electronics, transfer home ownership, decide our investments, sign sales contracts, get hired, fire someone, use warranties, access medical records, and so much more, works like how we rented a DVD. An unnecessary and expensive pain in the ass enforced by a Death Star of rules. It echoes the philosophy that preached to our ancestors that voting, reading science books, and owning a musket were all against the rules. Totally bullshtt, a veil made by con-artists.

Ignore red/blue's romaticism of revolutions! Use Techvolution to truly change the world. Let the people choose whichever tools best solve your problem. Digital tools and their many Jedi innovators, coders, technicians, designers, repair shops, are ready and waiting to solve real-life problems; it’s intoxicating to them. We just need a new philosophy, giving us the freedom to choose the best tools to solve our problems at home, work, and leisure. The people majically bonding with whatever tool they want, is the ultimate ~~revolution~~ Techvolution.

## The Anti-Death Star

Political philosophy is often called "visions of the just and good society". Every political philosophy imagines a world "classic stories" where the leaders are selfless and use their powers to benefit the community.

Socrates and Plato called these heroes the "philosopher kings", Aristotle called them "". Machiavelli called them a "educated prince". They each in their own way admonished selfish leaders, people who I called the Sith. None, not even my favorite Rousseau, could make a political philosophy that, when applied inside a rule book, killed the Sith forever.

The repeating story of civilization has been a society that embraces a ruling philosophy lead by true heroes using new tools to better their societies like Clovis I and George Washington. But eventually the story shifts. The leaders become self-important like Darth King Charles, and Darth Blockbuster and use spectacle to distract the masses.

Thus, even after the Jedi won, it wasn't long before the protagonists and antagonists again fought over tools, and the extras are stuck in between trying to figure out who the bad guys were.

So asking you to pick the right side? How can the people ever get it right.

That's why I never planned on writing this book. I only wrote this book to wipe all old philosophies and their rule books away. The people who don't understand the SpaceX landing a rocket is more important than any regulation reforms. That health-insurance doesn't mean a healthy population. That to advance humanity we need to let us majically advance our cyborgology any way we want.

Because the truth is, the Sith only survive because we have "visions" of a just and good society. Digital tools let's use actual see these visions and apply them to common senses.

Techvolution is the next ruling philosophy. It empowers seamless human technological evolution by ridding Darth Blockbuster of his power, by empowering extras to decide when society should upgrade our tools.

But it does so not with a rule book written by me, you, a manager, or a president. It does so with what I said at the very start every story is about. A new tool that changes the game. The only thing that can forever kill the Sith is a tool. A tool I say.

And what is this tool?

- i wrote this book to tell you what this new tool will do, and how it will be designed. It's a tool of perpetual stories, with heroes who overcome problems and return to equality without a fight.
- The political question of every time period was the same, are we going to change society to make the best use of new tools. And for use today, we're faced with the same question.
- the differetn stories, of classic, art/spectcle never understand each other. There's no common sense, sense as in the actual sense pain or smell, because their cyborgology is different. Not until the selfish rulers cause so many problems on the frontline, did enough people ignore the spectacle to demand change in the name of a new ruling philosophy designed to distribute the powers of new tools and thereby upgrade human's cyrborgology to solve back log of problems. Sometimes this huge outburts as in France, or small as in England.
- The point is, it's not possible to cross these stories. Power corrupts. Not everyone, but once it finds a host in human greed and short sightedness, getting it out is very hard, because the Death Star really exists. Its mountains of theology, or families bloodlines or inheritances and jurisprudence.
- The key then is give everyone a common sense to feel the pains of society, so the extras are not distracted by spectacle as the leaders ramp up the spectacle to mask their selfishness.

So come Stargazer, with your mind wipe clean up old philosophies and human written rule books, we can now find true answers to the human condition as we tear the mask of Nature, and stare into the face of God. While the Sith survive from their Death Star, we will kill them by a tool the Jedi can control, the Life Star.

- we've used stories to understand these ideas, and here's another, the please join us next week for the sequel, Life Star.

## A Fight Over No Tools

- stories can be big, or small, but each is structured the same....

So do you think Darth Blockbuster is dead? Do you think he'll ever die?

Do you feel the weight of the questin on your shoulders, Stargazer. Do you feel it—the weight of the world? The mantle of fate? As we create a new philosophy to rule our society's deepest definitions of right and wrong in all areas from politics to economics?

You shouldn't.

At the start of this journey, I told you characters fight over tools. In every story from The Illiad to Star Wars, the character who holds the tools is the victor who writes the rules.

So what tool have I given you to defeat the Sith?

Sure it's easy to mock Darth King Charles. It's easy to mock Darth Blockbuster. We have the cyborgology of history books and news articles to see their stupidity.

But who is the Darth in your life that'll you'll stand up to and saw "Hey listen asshole, clean out the garbage can and let someone else take command".

For Techvolution to be real, that has to happen.

The ruling philosophy hasn't been updated since America ran on dirt roads. It assumes unexplored horizons filled with wilderness that needs to be tamed in a land rush. Economic growth was paramount, hallowed in our culture protected in our rule book.

That's not the world we live in. We know America is 330,000,000 square miles. We know what resources there are. Growth has stopped. Now we need efficiency. Yet without a new ruling philosophy the salesman, the brokers, the spenders, are prioritized over the makers, the savers.

In 1973, when Gordon Moore said "We are really the revolutionaries in the world today—not the kids with long hair and beards who were wrecking the schools a few years ago." Most of the world's electronics was researched, designed, and made in America. Within twenty years that was barely the case.

That was the watershed moment in Western societies. The digital revolution didn't come with a political one. Rather than using digital tools to transform American, we exported America to keep old philosophies alive. We should have changed to obess about efficiency.

But that wasn't what corporate aristocracy knew how to do. Without a new ruling philosophy they went for the self-importance of performance art and the spectacle to distract the masses. That's why gas car brands multiplied, models were "redesigned" every year, all so the marketers, salesman and brokers had ever more ammo for their garbage meetings.

They rejected digital tools for the same reason kings rejected science books and people owning muskets. It meant there was nothing left to manage.

- success of the ruling philosophy, jumlbes the definition of success. it is serving hte heirarchy of the new tools, or making even newer tools? when does a story jump the shark?

All the while American should have been making Tesla's, and even better, started to build communities were digital tools like telecommunications over jam packed roads and mental illness inducing traffic.

When the spectacle would wear off on frontline people suffering in the "rust belt", the answer was always to bring in new people. Hence why I was cleaning office buildings as a kid. It was always easier to clean up after blue collar workers, they took pride in their workstations and stuff. Office workers had positions, so didn't like working "down".

They used a Death Star rule book to help themselves have meetings, and keep the workers away.

So how can the workers on the frontline fight back?

Techvolution in their hearts, but that still needs tool. So what's a tool to help the workers?

## Plot Twist Excess




My only insight to write Techvolution is the story of civilization. Which is that that tools are what driving force behind all human events. And that tools grow and adapt like any biological lifeform. The first step is very competitive as lifeforms spread as fast as they can in a winner takes all battle. The winners mark their territory, plants set their roots, animals roam and protect their territory, and once the lifeforms are secured, do they settle downa nd start to life a regular life. As they life, they then start to adapt to the area.

And here is when lifeforms stop competiting and start collaborating inside ecosystems. An ecosystem has borders and a strict divide between members and non-members, locals and foriegners. Locals know the game, and they settle down into a flow. This way each can harvest resources in a special way, and pass on the resources to another lifeform in the ecosystem. The constant flow keeps all lifeforms in check and balance, and makes sure they're all adapting even though there's no natural disaster to adapt to. There has to be members and non-members otherwise the lifeforms couldn't work together. That's why foreign species, like..., are so devastating. They simply don't know the rules of the ecosystem's game.

And this transition from competition, winners takes all, to the collaboration of an ecosystem, happens to human society's too. But with tools. When things are barren and desperate, our cybogology is weak, and thus we form strong hierarchies around the few people (protagonits) who control the few tools/adaptions. If the tools evolve, they get stronger, and thus more of the people can also evolve, and become their own protagonists. When enough people are protagonists, they're lifeforms, they need to switch over from the competition phase, to the collaboration phase. This is why after the Thirty Years War, humanity put up borders around their countries. They were forming an ecosystem, with members and non-members, so that they could collaborate.

Then we kept evolving, and when our tools were economic, we again spread them in the competition phase throughout the globe, and followed the early protagonists. But as economic tools evolved, more people could become protagonists, which is what happened in the 1970's and digital tools. And once enough of use were empowered by digital tools, we wanted to form ecosystems, economic this time, so we could collaborate. which is why Brexit, and Trump's election were so predictable and inevitable. The story of civilization is something we don't have a handle on, but it's the story of evolution simply with tools and humanity. Growth in a competive phase, then collaboration inside ecosystems. But humanity is like a blank canvas of lifeforms. We fill in the roles of lifeforms, and morph as required...

And this is what I'd tell a European peasant before hte Thirty Years War. They wouldn't understand it. So I'd tell them to be selfish. "What are you getting" if a protestant/catholic king wins. They'd respond with some dark majic answer about getting a better church, or going to heaven. Then I'd ask him to show me his daily life. And he'd show me his trip to the well everyday where he walks 10 litres of water to bring back to his house. He'd show me his manually labour cutting hay for his horses. And he'd show me this and that. And i'd tell him "the only thing you need to fight for, and better tools, better water systems, toilets, heating, insulation, because that's the only way God's creatures fight off the Devil, the rest is all talk."

He still wouldn't understand. He'd be like so many in the Milgram experiemtn and simply follow authority figures who think they're protagonists, but are really Lucifers. He wouldn't have the benefit of so much hindsight.

You do. All you have to do, is seek out digital tools to improve your life.Be selfish, because every animal in teh world is selfish, and that's what evolution is. That means we'll start to form economic ecosystems so we can collaborate. Some of that will be online, but most will have borders. It's the only way our social problems will get solved. Like overthrowing the antagonist kings, its going to happen.

The economic ecosystem, walls, tarrifs, nationalism, us vs them mentality, will go against the world ecosystem, hands across blahhh....

I just hope we don't live through a Thirty Years War, before we realize we were fighting the wrong fight.

## The Climax

Remember we said about that island. Humanity would have a set biology. The gullible and the stubborn would go back and forth, being loyal to the hierarchy, then rebelling to start a new one.

Where do you think you are? Well we can test for that.

Watch this video. It's a real experiment. It's about a test subject volunteering for a how does pain affect learning. The volunteer is a "teacher" who asks the "student" memory questions, for every wrong answer the teacher gives the student a shock of increasing shock. The student's really an actor, but the teacher thinks it's real.

Let's recap this. It's this entire book in a microcosm. There's an authority figure, a protagonist, who controls a tool, the teaching machine, who teaches it to an extra to better learn how people learn. The extra agrees this is a good reason and majically learns how to use this tool. As the teacher uses the tool there's a breaking point where he wants to stop. The authority figure responds with dark majic, and it works so damn well the teacher kills 50% of the time.

Notice though, most people want to stop before then. It's the authority figure that eggs them on. With Techvolution, we remove (as much as absolutely possible) the authority figure, and thus the teacher works with the student, and both agree to stop when the work is no longer contributing to a answer.

What this experiment, and so many others show, we have no idea how and why we make our decisions. And political decisions? We act on impulses we don't understand.

And those differences are way I wrote this book. Not because Techvolution is the new philosophy we need, but because it's the last ruling philosophy we'll need philosophy. It would be great to skip right to it. But we're getting it regarless and that's going to be scary. Because most people are under a dark majic belief system that wont hold up to what the tools of the future will show us. And digital tools will show us who we really are, and put is to a test, as we going to adapt or not.

## Thought Experiment - Biological Life

When does a species become foreign? The most obvious example are invasive species such as python's that ravaging Florida, or the Emerld Ash Borer that's killing North America's ash trees. There's a particular moment when a species is no longer welcome.

Imagine an island comes up from the ocean. Nothing but barren rock with no signs of life. There's nothing around it. No life means no ecosystem. It's a land rush. Any life is welcome. Whoever comes first and sets up their roots and marks their territory will adapt themselves to the barren area. As new lifeforms arrive, they have to find their place, which increasingly means finding a niche of resources no other lifeform is making use of.

There'd be waves of new lifeforms. Plants would make an ecosystem. Then insects would arrive. Then reptiles and mammals etc. Assuming there was no natural disasters killing off all lifeforms new lifeforms would keep arriving.

Eventually though, enough lifeforms would adapt they'd be no more room left. All opportunities to harvest resources would have a dedicated lifeform to harvest them, and lifeforms will exist depending on each other. Flowers will bloom expecting there to be bees, and bees will expect there to be flowers. A ecosystem will form. A system of checks and balances betweeen lifeforms who barely know each other who all exist because of their shared food web.

So when does a species become foriegn?  When an ecosystem is up and running. The exact moment is hard to know, but it exists. That's one thought experiment. The realization that life starts as a land rush, and at one point a ecosystem is established, and lifeforms are either members or non-members. Now let's do this again with technological life.

## Thought Experiment - Technological Life

Now add humanity to this imaginery island. Not modern humanity, but our ancestors from around the Stone Age. So we wouldn't be the first to arrive. The island would have had millions of years to establish a biological ecosystem. How would we integrate into this ecosystem.

We would be foreign species. We'd gather resources, but also harvest our own. We'd adapt the ecosystem to accomodate us. We'd farm the plants we want, and divert the water we needed. And we'd use the biological lifeforms as our tools. We'd use furs for warmth, wood for fuel, oxen for labour.

However, we'd soon make tools ourselves. We'd make stone axes, wood spears, and buckets and soon we'd be progressing up to the Bronze Age, Steel Age, and so forth. So we'd be technologically evolving. One day we'd have no Bronze Age tools, and generations later, we would. And the process would repeat itself over and over as new technology was developed.

And that evolution would be a recurring story of barren landscapes, becoming populated by new tools in a land rush, and eventually those tools would form an ecosystem. But that ecosystem would be a barren landscape once new and better tools were created. So the process would start all over again.

Biologically humanity would stay the same. Personalities, talents, abilities, characters, curiosities. But socially, we'd have roles in the development and distribution of new tools.

So we'd have two identies. The natural biological person we are, and the societal role we're playing during the development of new tools. And thus we have two selves. One for the person we are, and another for the job we have. It's ruling philosophies that connect us to our jobs, while its majic that makes us keep our souls alive. The trick is to make the two meet. So, our jobs let us be who we really are, taking away the conflict of doing jobs we hate.

And that comes inside ecosystem. The point of this thought experiment was to showcase that humanity is always evolving our tools. But we do it the way biology does it. We have an ecosystem in place, but as soon as a new technology is created, our civilization is a barren island again, which must populate with new products. And we're forever trying to form ecosystems, places with members and non-members, so our two selves, our personalities and jobs, can co-exist.

This divide between a self-for others, and a master-slave arrangement. It's as simple as saying we all wish we were doing a job we loved. And that is when the rules of society, and the majic in our souls, are in alignment. And that happens when were a member of a community, free to live our lives because we have value.

## Thirty Years War

The story of evolving new tools, coming together into hierachies, only to fight for distribution, is a recurring story. That means it's ongoing right now. Also, since it's how we evolve tools, it will always be there as well.

So where are we in this story of civilization. Two different points.

The first is around the Thirty Years War (1618-1648), which was after King Charles, but before Rousseau. The extras were so sick of their political system. The hunger and scared peasants running away from Vikings begging to get behind the gates of castles of arrogant but actually dutiful kings were no more. Now it was pompeous kings sent from God, to host banquets and balls. So they revolted and Europe burned from 30 years in a war equal in size and terror to World War II.

But one big problem. The people hated their ruling philosophy, but didn't have a new one to express themselves. All they had was the divine rights of kings with two flavours. Protestant kings or Catholic kings. So extras pissed off at their ruling philosophy, blamed each other's beliefs when in reality it was the shared system they hated. The carnage was so bad, both sides agreed to leave each other alone, and 1648 is when political ecosystems officially started. The borders of each country were set, respected, and officially people inside were members, and people outside were not.

Still, the people weren't happy. The next century extras in both Protestant and Catholic kingdoms, rose up to shed themselves of kingdom and declare themselves protagonists in a democracy of equals we live in today.

Today we're in the same spot. The extras are pissed up. No longer the hungry and desperate masses that crowded the employment lines of the Industrial Revolution. And as we get more pissed off, we have two options of the same ruling philosophy, red or blue. Neither has any new answers so the only thing left is war.

If I went back in time to 1618 and could tell all those Germans, French, English, Swedes, extras how to avoid killing themselves over a old ruling philosophy, I'd tell them all exactly what I've told you. Because what I've told you are the lessons we've learned from their struggle. The modern extra/consumer, what anyone would tell a extra/peasant in 1610. You don't need to fight for the king, you have to fight for yourself.

And that would be cool and would make a good movie. A race against time to see if Neo could release the religious Europeans from their bondage before 30 years of war. But it still wouldn't work. Europe would still burn and so will we. Because regardless of what I could say, nobody would believe me, back in 1618 or now.

All i've done here is take the lessons our ancestors worked to hard to collect, and went back in time to tell you, the modern extra/consumer, what anyone would tell a extra/peasant in 1610. You don't need to fight for the king, you have to fight for yourself.

I didn't write this book to tell you what the past teaches us. I wrote it to tell you what the future is going to show you. Because that is something you'll get to see for yourself.

## Ask

Hi ya'll,

I could use a favour. I've spent some time writing a book and need some feedback. I've already finished it, but it's taking more time (it's why I’ve been kinda absent lately) to polish it than I thought it would. So, before I do anymore, I'd like to know if it's worth it.

It's about technology and politics, and how the middle-class can get a better deal when dealing with government and businesses. I worked hard to make it readable, I'm just not sure if it's good enough that people will actually read it.

The sample is about 25 pages, so if you're up for it, I'd appreciate some help. DM me and I'll send a link.

Cheers!

## Thirty Years War

## Read Now or Read Later

There's a heck of a lot of political emotions in today's Western Civilization. Conservative and Progressive are worldwide ideologies in disarray. Their believers march and scream just as much after elections as before them. I'd put our situation right before the Thirty Years War (1618-1648). A time when Catholicism and Protestantism spanned the globe, and their believers back at home were so discontent they fought against evil "Catholic" or "Protestant" kings.

What the people really wanted was a new political philosphy. But there's no mental switch. It was only after Europeans questioned their kings, that they realized their all kings were assholes. Soon the people demanded freedom inside their own countries and so they fought the American (1776) and French Revolutions (1789).

Why didn't they just fight the kings? For the same reason we just just pick up the keys to a space ship today. There's research and development involved for our philosophies. It involves living a life on the frontline, experiencing all it's the problems, using the tools that could solve them, and using reason to create a readable explanation for the new rules that should govern our lives. If that happened sooner Europe may have avoided a lot of bloodshed.

Right now, each person on the Main Street has a choice. It's not support Conservative or Progressive because these are just like picking a protestant or catholic king. I never meant to or wanted to write this book. It's not written as a political philosophy or history book. I could have but didn't want to. Instead it's written for everyone on Main Street to look up and realize your smartphone, augmented reality, 4k video camera aren't just toys. They're the start of the Digital Age.

We achieved great things in the Industrial Age. It wasn't perfect, but new tools in medicine, physics, sanitation, education, agriculture empowered us to fight disease, ignorance, and hunger. But we're not in the Industrial Age anymore. Using old philosophies to solve our problems makes as much sense as using theology did to our ancestors all those years ago. We need a new philosophy, one that inspires people to think of the big picture again.

Political philosophies start with books. It was a series of books that lead Medieveal commoners to believe and undestand how they could control their own socieities. Either this is the one, or another one is. But it's not two aged, old, and bygone political beliefs go down fighting and take us all with thems.

## Open-Source Paragraph

I'm not talking about an idealist, imaginary world envisioned from storybooks. The Digital Age has already started to form. We've already seen how worker-to-worker collaboration already exists. We're living in its midst. Wikipedia, YouTube, Quora, Stack Overflow, VS Code, Firefox, Wikipedia, Common Voice, USB Implementers Forum, GitHub, Andriod, LibreOffice, and Linux are only a few examples of the wonderful world of cooperation working today. It's called the open-source community because software and ideas are "openly shared" to help create new tools. Millions of people are already working and living inside a fundamentally new way of life that's responsible for our awesome online world. There's no reason more industries can't adopt this worker-to-worker collaboration mindset.

## Property Generation and Regulation Nulled by Digital Property

Conservatism says protecting personal property keeps society rich because everyone has incentive to create new property or keep what they have in good condition. Hence conservaties don't like things like taxes or regulation that intefere with their "I know what's best" mentality. Progressives think different property really belongs to the community that worked in the mines, factories, stories and so forth, so Progressives want to regulate property to be sure selfish people (conservaties) don't control it to keep themselves rich.
  
Neither of these idea apply digital property. Digital property doesn't spoil, so there's no reason to "own" it. And it's limitless, so there's no reason to "regulate" it. Yet property protection, and property regulation, are what both conservatives and progressives know how to do, and thus they have to find phantoms to fight.

## The Majic of the Internet - Because of Cyborgolgy, If We Use the Internet, We Automatically Fight For the Digital Age

The internet has many protagonists. Paul Baran is one of the big ones. Here’s why.

The internet is a network. There are many ways of sending data through a network. The simplest is how phone systems do it with a direct circuit link between two phones. A call’s connection only stops when someone hangs up.

Alexander Graham Bell invented "direct circuit links" in 1876 and put it into action when he co-founded the American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T) in 1885. For generations direct links was how all telecommunications worked. But when the Soviets tested a hydrogen bomb in 1955, Paul Baran took it upon himself to make a new tool to help prevent a nuclear holocaust.

Baran realized to prevent nuclear war, the world needed a communications network that would survive an atomic attack. Only robust and reliable communications would ease American and Soviet trigger fingers during tense times.

Baran worked alone after work. By 1960 he came up with the two ideas he needed. The first was that his network should have no hubs or organizations (like telephone’s have) to control the flow of information. Central hubs make systems vulnerable to attack or failure. Instead data flow should be completely distributed so every node can send and receive information equally. Baran’s nodes network looks like a fishnet. When each  node has three or four links, the network can survive any attack.

Next Baran had to figure out how to send information across the network. This led to his second idea, which was to break up the data into standard-size little packets. Each message would be broken into many packets, each of which would scurry along different paths through the network’s nodes and be reassembled when they got to their destination. If one packet didn’t get there in time, it was quickly resent. This way there’d be no "dropped calls" and communication would always stay open. Baran published his ideas into very detailed technical specs and made sure everyone, especially the Soviets, could copy his work.

Baran then walked into a nest of villains in America. When Baran’s employer RAND recommended his "node-packet data network" idea to the Air Force (in control of America’s nuclear missiles) they wanted to build it. But when the Department of Defense got itself and the Defense Communications Agency involved Baran soon found out working with so many bureaucrats was hopeless.

So Baran tried to convince AT&T, in control of America’s telephone network, to supplement their system with his node-packet data network. "They fought it tooth and nail," he recalled. "They tried all sorts of things to stop it". They would not even let RAND use the maps of its circuits, so Baran had to use a pirated set. He made several trips to AT&T headquarters in lower Manhattan. On one of them, a senior executive who was an old engineer looked stunned when Baran explained that his system would mean that data could go back and forth without a dedicated link remaining open. "He looked at his colleagues in the room while his eyeballs rolled up sending a signal of his utter disbelief," according to Baran. After a pause, the executive said, "Son, here’s how a telephone works," and explained a patronizing and simplistic description.

The metaphorical Death Star rule book became real! It was against the rules to make a reliable communication network that might help prevent a nuclear holocaust. Good thing Jedi’s don’t give up. Baran continued to push. AT&T finally had him and other outsiders to a series of seminars explaining how its telephone system really worked. "It took ninety-four separate speakers to describe the entire system," Baran marveled. When it was over, the AT&T executives asked Baran, "Now do you see why packet switching wouldn’t work?" To their great disappointment, Baran simply replied, "No".

To heck with Darth Telephone!

A decade later Baran’s network was built when the US government’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) saw the wisdom in a node-packet distributed communications network. In 1969 ARPA used Baran’s technical specs to build ARPAnet, the first version of the internet. The people who made it were hellbent on empowering individuals, and the made sure the internet could not be controlled by any government or corporation.

Baran’s network is why our smartphones, websites, Wikipedia, any digital tool connected to the internet empower individuals. In the DNA of the internet is a distributed node network that nobody can control or shutdown. An individual has the exact same access as any corporation or government.

That’s why the internet is majical. Whoever uses it, is automatically empowered.

_Paul Baran's story was adapted from Walter Isaacson's awesome book_ The Innovators, _Chapter 7._

## Summary

I'm going to cut this short.

Listen to me. When your cars breaks down, you call a mechanic for help, right? If he showed up with no tools, you’d get mad. You wouldn't ask his reasons for not bringing tools, nor would you discuss the weather with him. You needed "Mike the mechanic" to show up and solve your problem. Without the tools he's just "Mike the person", and frankly useless to you.

If there were no tools, you'd have to resort to regulations and campaigning to get people to help you. But with tools, all you need is the tools and a person who can use them. Tools are political problem solvers. Tools are political power.

Middle class people have a host of problems like increasing insurance, prescription drug, and tutoring bills. You need solutions. When someone says they can help, you must ask what tool they have, or will give you, that will help. Anything else is smoke and mirrors. You don’t need to see regulations, laws, or blog posts anymore then you need to see the mechanic’s favorite car repair manual. You need tools.

Red/blue philosophies show up with no tools. Not because red/blue leaders and supporters don’t care. But because their philosophies don’t know better. They're stuck inside an old ecosystem before the Digital Age. Thus they believe in a political ecosystem with members and non-members, but an economic island still trying to grow. But digital tools make economic ecosystems possible. But since our ruling philosophy is old, it's stuck on old tools, and thus they tell the middle class to walk to the nearest gas station and hope for help, and they promptly blame the opposing political party when we complain.

That’s not horrible, until you consider that with a new digital car, like a Tesla, our broken cars can now call the mechanic, give him a diagnostic to his smartphone immediately, and he’d be able to tell what the problem is, and most importantly, tell the scared person the side of the road, what to do next.

Now consider it’s often against the rules to solve our problems so simply. Patent laws, insurance regulations, nondisclosure agreements, non-compete clauses; a mountain of rules any antagonist can search through so he can force us to keep walking to gas stations.

We must realize how much new digital tools help. Here’s an exercise to do it. Every time you want to watch a Netflix show or YouTube video, get in your car, drive five miles, wait 10 minutes, throw away six bucks, drive back home, and then press play. Watch the movie, drive back within 24 hours or get charged a late fee. Easy to forget, but that’s what watching content on demand with videocassettes and DVDs was like.

Netflix was a big victory. But a rare one. Today, how we pay taxes, recognize education, repair electronics, transfer home ownership, decide our investments, sign sales contracts, get hired, fire someone, use warranties, access medical records, and so much more, works like how we rented a DVD. An unnecessary and expensive pain in the ass enforced by a Death Star of rules. It echoes the philosophy that preached to our ancestors that voting, reading science books, and owning a musket were all against the rules. Totally bullshit, and holding us all back from the land of equality, responsibilties, freedom, and accountability  we want to live in. And we will, once we think of politics as holding tools.

## The Problem With Not Having an Ending

So do you think Darth Blockbuster is dead? Do you think he'll ever die? Do you feel the weight of the questin on your shoulders, Stargazer. Do you feel it—the weight of the world? The mantle of fate? As we create a new philosophy to rule our society's deepest definitions of right and wrong in all areas from politics to economics?

You shouldn't. For this book was merely a lesson in the history of political philosophy. Which is history of sequels.

I didn't write this book to create a new ruling philosophy that we'll use to make a new rule book. Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, St. Augustine, Francis Bacon, John Locke, even my favorite Rousseau could't make a political philosophy that, when applied inside a rule book, was agreed upon by everyone.

Protagonists and antagonists still fought over tools, and the extras were stuck in between trying to figure out who the bad guys were. Most of political philosophy is basically new version of my "one good story, and two bad stories" explanation. The point is in the 2300 years of politcal philosophy we're still here aruging over if its okay for someone to download download a movie or not.

Regardless of the political philosophy, human frailty taints its application when writing the rulebook to govern everyday life. Power corrupts man, turning once classical heroes (and especially their descendants) into self-important "art" film characters who use their money to distract the masses with spectacle. When spectacle doesn't work they use their Death Star rule book to hold on for as long as possible.

Thus, I didn't write this so Techvolution will replace red/blue politics with its own rule book. Even though it would be an improvement, it wouldn't all that digital tools make possible. I only wrote this book to wipe old rule books away.

Because digital tools are the telescope showing us the Nature in a new light. One that finally let's us finally see the "visions of the just and good society" the philosophers dreamed about.

So come Stargazer, with your mind wipe clean up old philosophies, and human written rule books, we can now find true answers to the human condition as we tear the mask of Nature, and stare into the face of God.

## Quotes on Thirty Years War

“Though they are now largely silent, the voices from the seventeenth century still speak to us from the innumerable texts and images we are fortunate to possess. They offer a warning of the dangers of entrusting power to those who feel summoned by God to war, or feel that their sense of justice and order is the only one valid.”
― Peter H. Wilson, Europe's Tragedy: A New History of the Thirty Years War

“Protestant propaganda presented the Thirty Years War as a papal crusade, with the Jesuits as the pontiff’s storm troopers.”
― Peter H. Wilson, Europe's Tragedy: A New History of the Thirty Years War

## explaining philosophy

The political ideologies we have today—Conservative, Progressive, Socialist, Marxist—are just like the Athens Democracy, Roman Republic, and Divine Monarch. They are merely options we can choose from to our society. With every technological era, comes a new philosophy to (try) and get people to see the big picture, that everyone should be the player god. This is important to remember. Our politics changes with technological development.

## Technological History of the Movies - Using what weve learned

Assuming you tried, it's funny how easy it was to find Darth Blockbuster on YouTube. Now, I need to know how movies and television technologically evolved. This would take weeks at a library. But I have Wikipedia so it'll take a few hours. Rubbish indeed professors.

So let's go.

The first thing to understand, is movies didn't invent stories. We've always, and always will, tell stories. They help us understand our lives and societies. Religious sermons, epic poetry, and stage plays have filled our need of stories throughout the years.

The movies, and later television, are merely tools that help tell stories. Each is a creation of three pieces of technology. Data transmission, data storage, and data viewing. Movies started in 1894 when Thomas Edison’s laboratory invented the kinetoscope; the first machine that moved pictures through a light source fast enough to give the impression of seamless movement. Hence the name "moving pictures", simplified as "movies".

The kinetoscope was like a vending machine for movies. Customers looked through a peep hole to see clips of boxing matches or dance routines. It was a popular novelty, kind of like GIFs on Instagram. Edison owned the patents and created the New Jersey based Motion Picture Patent Corporation (MPPC) to make sure everyone in the young movie industry paid their dues.

After a few years of MPPC’s interference and legal threats, in what amounted to shakedowns, movie companies moved to Los Angeles to get away. As new projector technology came, MPPC lost its patent monopoly anyway. The movie industry was free to grow in LA’s good weather, cheap land, and no stifling East Coast corporate hierarchies.

And best yet technology kept improving. New projectors could show movies on huge screens. Although reels weren’t long enough yet to show long movies. With the new projectors, movie theaters called Nickelodeons (because admission cost a nickel) opened up across the country. The movies were still novelties, showing exotic animals, news reels, or sports highlights, but getting better, like Instagram stories, instead of GIFs.

By the 1920’s film reels were long enough to show three act stories. Although sound still wasn’t synched with film, so movies had subtitled dialogue and theatres used live music bands to communicate emotions.

In 1927 film was finally synchronized with sound, giving movies dialogue and music. For the first time in history, full stories were not limited to a physical theatre. Any movie theatre in the world could show any story. A new storytelling tool was thus created.

Like Instagram or Netflix popularity today, the people certainly felt the magic of good storytelling, and the majic of needing the theatre. No longer a novelty, the movies attracted millions every week. American industry rushed to control the booming industry. American culture was told on the silver screen. Leading actors became cultural icons. The industry exploded with profits. Although the people controlled none of it, their interest and loyalty made it happen one movie ticket at a time.

Of course, all the technology that made the movie industry so rich and powerful was physical. Data storage, transport, and viewing was physical film, light projectors, and delivery trucks.

This didn’t change until a new tool was born in 1948. Televisions used a different mixture of technologies. Huge magnetic tape reels stored content. Radio transmitted content over the airwaves. And televisions received the transmissions, and displayed the content on tube televisions.

Broadcasts television companies like NBC, ABC, and CBS, now competed with movie theatres. TV story quality wasn’t as good, but the convenience was huge; especially as Americans slowly moved away from the cities packed with movie theatres into the suburbs packed with TV’s.

From the 1950’s to the early 1980’s nothing much changed in the entertainment industry. Movies and television got better technologies. Film reels got clearer, color, and widescreen. Likewise, televisions got bigger and bandwidth improved with cable. But no new tools were created. The people still couldn’t choose or produce their own content.

Then came new tools. The magnetic tapes databases that stored TV broadcasters’ content, got small enough to make home video cassette recorder (VCR). VCR’s cut out the broadcaster, who of course sued the manufacturer Sony for letting people break the rules and "time shift" television shows. The case ended up in the Supreme Court in 1984.

In a 5-4 vote the power to record and watch videos was distributed to the people; the extras were free to add the VCR to their cyborgology. VCRs, home cameras, and renting movies became very popular in the late 1980’s. The most successful video rental company took the name "Blockbuster", the common term for popular movies. The entertainment industry quickly forgot about its VCR objections, and gladly put its content on Blockbuster’s busy shelves.

Home entertainment tools kept getting better. In the late 1990’s came DVD’s and flat screen televisions. DVD’s were more advanced CD’s, and worked like videotapes, except they were digital. Meaning data was stored as "1 or 0". Plasma or LCD flat screens televisions were much bigger than tube televisions, and since they were digital too, they were High Definition.

Even more people rushed to upgrade their cyborgology with DVD’s and home theatres. Blockbuster rental stores were even busier, especially as people started buying hundreds of DVD’s for home libraries. The entertainment industry loved it. They didn’t even care movie theatre attendance dropped heavily and many went bankrupt. In fact, they started to use theatres as marketing hype. The money was in DVD sales.

Yet they didn’t notice, that the data transmission, data storage, and data viewing technologies of the movie industry was now almost entirely digital.

Except movie distribution. People still had to drive to pick up their DVD’s or less likely visit a movie theatre. Hence, people still needed to concentrate around movie theatres, rental stores, or TV guides (i.e. the castles with gatekeepers), to access their digital data.

Until they didn’t.

The internet, the transfer of digital information that was used for email and webpages since the 1970’s, had kept getting better and faster. And in the early 2000’s the internet got High Speed, and could finally transfer 1’s and 0’s of a DVD faster then someone driving to pick one up.

And here enters The Pirate Bay (2003). Like Napster, it introduced digital movies to people first. Although the entertainment industry used digital cameras, film projectors, email, webpages, YouTube for years, they didn’t want people using a new tool, but to keep using their profitable DVD technology; they even made two new ones called Blu-Ray (2006) and HD-DVD (2006).

The people wanted the better tool. The one that made their life more profitable. After all the countless hours needed to invent new digital tools was mostly done on their tax dollars in government labs and military funding and university institutions. Pirate Bay was the first to offer the new technology as a new tool to the people. It was a pain, it was hard to learn, but it was better than driving.

Remember the industry called this people thieves! Customers are pirates! People are evil, people are cheap, people are thieves! Really? Then explain the graph below, the one what shows how the evil people responded with protagonist Reed Hastings in 2005 made a new internet tool and gave internet movies to the people. What we call Netflix, by 2009, when Hollywood was panicking about BitTorrents, the people were finally given internet streaming. This was the same fucking time as Darth Blockbuster and the industry was complaining about human evolution.

    </script>

If middle class Americans and Canadians are pirates, why didn’t Blockbuster stores have steel bars? The same reason why we don’t steal Netflix. Blockbuster was a fair deal, until data streaming movies was possible. Then Netflix was.

The people elected to download movies from pirate bay because it was an upgrade available to their cyborgology. The only natural rule is natural selection. When people choose the best tool, they evolve into better cyborgs. It’s not the people’s job to wait for an industry to catch up to Nature. It should be the other way around.

Maybe the industry would have noticed that. Instead, they were too busy surrounding themselves with art and wanted people to being distracted with spectacle (Blu-Ray, HD-DVD). While calling their own customer’s thieves, the movie industry held countless banquets and balls on the people’s DVD dollars; movie premieres, talk shows, award shows, and launch parties. Read books like Hollywood Interrupted and the revelation of the #MeToo movement, and these parties were, never mind self-congratulatory, but often even evil.

The industry became self-obessed artists patting themselves on the back for making every weirder films, while manufacturing cheap spectacle to distract the masses. The masks of royalty appeared again. Success wasn't defined by those on the frontline, but by politicking and ingratiating oneself to the putrid politics of a aged industry.

The Oscars, Correspondence Dinners, Emmy’s, Golden Globes, Cannes Film Festival, Sundance Film Festival, Toronto International Film Festival, and so many others. All modern version of banquets and balls, with gates to keep you out, and rules put in place to make the good times of the DVD going. Party loving, profit loving, foresight lacking is a recipe for antagonism, hence Darth Blockbuster rose up.

While the spectacle of Blu-Ray and HD-DVD tricked some extras, like with Wikipedia attracting people despite the supposed experts objections, the vast majority followed the natural majic of online movie streaming instead, even when it was against the rules to improve society.

Digital tools empowered the extras to fight back, and check his self-important art story. Nevermind that the people flocked to HBO and Netflix not only for the better technology and value, but because these companies emulated early Hollywood and told classic stories like _The Sopranoes_, _Breaking Bad_, and _Game of Thrones_. The people sought out these products.

In short, the movie industry was led by people who didn't know how to tell stories. They re-used past hits to squeeze as much out of the glory days as possible. Hence, so many movies were sequals and remakes that were simply bad stories.

The artists inside the industry got back at them with a system of "one for them, one for me" and made increasingly weired, unenjoyable, and politically charged art films.

Here's the frontline difference between spectacle/art, and classic stories.

If rying to make people shake in their seats by adding a motor isn't bullshit... So the people revolvted to new leaders. Heroes that used modern tools to do a good job and tell quality stories.

Techvolution tells them its right to do it. As for it being against the rules, it was, but the rules weren't updated to digital tools so who cares.

As for me. I was naive back then and never downloaded any movies. I was the sucker buying DVD’s.

Hey, do you think Darth Blockbuster will buy back all those DVDs, Blu-Rays, and HD-DVDs he told me, and us, was better than downloading? I wonder did those go up, or down, in value?

- The Computer Age was started by traitors. It's true. History calls them, with a grin of course, the Traitorous Eight. They were eight young kids, working for Shockley Semi-conductor in the 1950s. Shockley had helped invent the transistor and commercializing it. Sadly, he'd fallen into paranoia and made his workers miserable, They weren't happy because they knew they could change the world. So these eight unknown chemists, physicits, machinists, engineers, left Shockley and started their own company. It was still the Industrial Age, and hence these workers were supposed to be extras doing what they were told. Society yelled at them "this is a shameful act".

Who cares what the Sophia's of the world say today. These kids became protagonists of the Computer Age. These eight people are directly responsible for Intel, AMD, Kleiner Perkins, National Semiconductors, and many more companies. Indirectly, they seeded Silicon Valley with Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, and so on. Every Computer Age protagonist and player god today owes these eight people a debt of gratitude.
