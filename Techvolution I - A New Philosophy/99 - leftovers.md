# Magic Connections Make Stories

First dates are amazing. Even the generic dinner and movie ones are wondrous. Sitting there in your nice sweater, eating a medium steak, sipping water, and across from you is a stem-cell. What the fuck? Yep. Stem-cell. She, (or he), could be your Juliette.  This moment might start a story where in a few days, you might pay your soul to prevent even a frown on this stranger's heavenly face.  Such is the power of romances.

Or this moment might end with a five year divorce with true accusations of infidelity where you eat beans for breakfast, bitters for lunch and dinner, and see your kids once a week. Your own offspring thinking you're a stranger because of this demon.  Such is the power of tragedies.

In truth, most stories are somewhere in between two extremes; but that's beside the point. The point is every story starts with a connection.  If human life is a tapestry of stories, both grand and small, we have to understand how we make and keep people connected to their stories.

It's question of reason. A connection is made when a story is on the borderline. One that is unexpected enough to be interesting, yet reasonable enough to be understood.  People, viewers, readers, don't have to be conscious of every element. A good story takes a person over.  That's why we often loose ourselves to the romance.  Of course people want to stay in a happy story, and exit an unhappy one.

So to get someone connected to a story, we must make them happy. Easy enough. Everyone likes happiness.

That's easy to know, hard to achieve. Your Juliette could think your a loser.  Your Romeo might be ignoring her text messages. The point is we can't make happiness, we can't force a connection. Happiness is a magical connection between you, and a person, product, achievement, leader, or society, that forces a person to stay inside a story.

People want to leave bad stories, live horrors, tragedies, and dramas, because it is achieving little. Yet we want to stay inside good stories; romances, comedies, adventures because of a magical connection that takes there willpower and harnesses it to fuel a good story.

Happy stories are magical. So the question is, are you happy with yours?

## It's Not Changing

You read about King Charles I. The king who died rather than apologize. We're using King Charles to showcase how nobles couldn't understand any objections to their rule because they didn't understand their role in the story of life has a natural conclusion.

Meaning, once peace and security returned to western Europe, the nobility's storyline ended. Thus, the nobility should have proactively done what Rousseau said, and return to being equal members of society. They didn't of course. And history used many violent revolutions to right that wrong.

Charles had a speech impediment. Often called a stammer or studder. No one then, or even now, understands what causes it. It's like a gremlin holding an electrical cord connecting your thoughts and your tongue; sometimes the electricity flows, and sometimes it doesn't. In practice this means some words are easy to say, some are hard, and some decide which at the last millisecond. Smooth talking requires agility as the speaker has to manuever around this path of uncertainty.

Hello, my ~~name~~ I go by John-ne. I wa-want to help ~~master~~ destroy revolutions. I've been ~~writ~~ trying to write this book for ~~about~~ a ~~year~~ six months...

The prospect of talking, accept to yourself and your dog, causes huge anxiety as you can imagine.

I know this because luckily enough (kidding) I have the same affliction as King Charles. Ironically it was the reason I got a job in a car insurance claim department. After a Vice President at an old company secretly told my supervisor I wasn't allowed to talk to customers, for fear of embarrasing the company, I was like shit I guess I don't have this damn thing under control.

I wasn't even that mad about it (although I was that they were not upfront). I never told anyone I had the impediment, so it obviously was an problem.

So fuck it. Jump into the deep end and sick or swim. Car insurance claim call-centre was like the Olympic trails for a stutterer, so I jumped in. Huge emotions, all day phone calls, customer service expectations, no "outs" like swear words or wonky behavior to hide behind.

And it was far worse then I thought. The company would ring a "bell" all day because... I don't know, to de-sensitize us to customers pleas for more money, or to bully us. Either way, DING-DING-DING-DING all day. No apps. No machine learning. No ideas but a motherfucking bell that gave people who weren't stutteres huge anxiety, breakdowns, and sick leaves. We were bullied in other ways, but the worst was only being given given fax machines, email, and voicemail to coordinate 200 plus car accident files at the same time.

Shock speech therapy!  After about a year I didn't have to massage my jaw at night, to release it from all the jaw-clenches I did to divert vocal stuttering. I was cured!

The point is this. That's what I took for me to mostly now, never really stutter. It's like night and day. A hidden personality was fostered and frankly is fun to be. Yet Charles never had this lesson. He was famoulsy shy, quiet, and anxious because that's the personality _it_ superimposes onto you. Even when fighting 10 years of war Charles still probably had to massage his strained jaws after work every night.

Yet, when on trial for his life, Charles did not stutter. Oliver Cromwell, a Napoleon like figure except he was a religious puritan, led the trial against Charles for "crimes against the English people". Cromwell said the nobles didn't have a "divine right to rule". Charles wasn't pretending to not understand. He wasn't proud, or stubborn. He pyschologically couldn't understand. He was so sure of himself, he bypassed the gremlin spoke in such elegant words many people were impressed.

Charles spoke clearly because he believed in something. He was wrong, dead wrong. Pun intended. His and his peers ignorance caused so much destruction we'll be studying it for centuries. Yet he still believed in making a better society. He died believing in it.

## It's Your Story, What Do You Think

And now we get to you. The reader. The person inside the woven tapestry of technological creation. The grand story of our ancestors was taming security by making nobility divine; ours has been taming poverty by making private property divine, and your individual life is somewhere inside there. Remember while it's okay to be little confused by a story while you're watching it, we also must understand its reason when looking back at it.

Looking back at your day, year, life, do you see the reason inside the story of your life? To have a techvolution means we have to understand the ruling philosophy, and the technological development that will someday discredit that philosophy. Defining our ruling philsophy is easy enough. Knowing when our woven tapestry of technological development discredits our ruling philosophy is easy in retrospect. Yet what about when we are inside the story right now.

Good thing we can feel the answer. It's the same feel that the people had when they sang:

>When the beating of your heart
Echo’s the beating of the drums
There is a life about to start
When tomorrow comes!

Our ancestors felt their ruling philosophy had to go. They felt it in their lives because they could not see the reason inside their own stories anymore. The could fell they had to jump to a new story. A new chapter in the story of humanity where people live free, but work together to conquer poverty. We know now that technology had disabled the need for political nobility. Yet for them, they could just feel the lure of freedom and could do nothing but fight for it.

What about you now, in your life. Is it obvious to you, as a character in the story, why you live the life you do. Let's find out how can you might tell.

Your spend most of your life going to, sitting at your place of work. When you're there, do you feel like you're helping society?  Do you see the reason for spending your life at work?  Or do you see chains keeping you from a better life.  That question started the French Revolution.  And now you need to answer it before we have our own.

## Think Carefully

When you're asked are you happy, please don't think things will change or get better.  No matter what happens, today's nobility will not change themselves.  You can try to sell modern technology to a old bureaucracy or corporation to see it.  But here's a easier, and more drastic way to tell just how convinced we all get into our stories.

You read about King Charles I. The king who died rather than apologize. We're using King Charles to showcase how nobles couldn't understand any objections to their rule because they didn't understand their role in the story of life had a natural conclusion.  

Meaning, once peace and security returned to western Europe, the nobility's storyline ended. Thus, the nobility should have proactively done what Rousseau said, and return to being equal members of society. They didn't of course. And history used many violent revolutions to right that wrong.

The prospect of talking, accept to yourself and a dog, causes huge anxiety as you can imagine.  _The King's Speech_ show it all well enough.

I know this because luckily enough (kidding) I have the same affliction as King Charles. Ironically it was the reason I got a job in a car insurance claim department. After a Vice President at an old company secretly told my supervisor I wasn't allowed to talk to customers, for fear of embarrasing the company, I was like shit I guess I don't have this damn thing under control.  I wasn't even that mad about it (although I was that they were not upfront). I never told anyone I had the impediment, so it obviously was an problem.

So fuck it. Jump into the deep end and sick or swim. Car insurance claim call-centre was like the Olympic trails for a stutterer, so I jumped in. Huge emotions, all day phone calls, customer service expectations, no "outs" like swear words or wonky behavior to hide behind.

The point is this. That's what I took for me to mostly now, never really stutter. It's like night and day. A hidden personality was fostered and frankly is fun to be. Yet Charles never had this lesson. He was famoulsy shy, quiet, and anxious his whole life because that's the personality _it_ superimposes onto you. Even when fighting 10 years of war Charles still probably had to massage his strained jaws after work every night.

Yet, when on trial for his life, Charles did not stutter. Oliver Cromwell, a Napoleon like figure except he was a religious puritan, led the trial against Charles for "crimes against the English people". Cromwell said the nobles didn't have a "divine right to rule". Charles wasn't pretending to not understand. He wasn't proud, or stubborn. He pyschologically couldn't understand. He was so sure of himself, he bypassed the gremlin spoke in such elegant words many people, even those who hated him, were impressed.

Charles spoke clearly because he believed in something. He was wrong, dead wrong. Pun intended. His and his peers ignorance caused so much destruction we'll be studying it for centuries. Yet he still believed in making a better society. He died believing in it while speaking his last words without a hint of a stutter.

So when you answer the question, are you happy today, imagine yourself, and your kids, living like today for the rest of their lives.  Otherwise, the ruling philosophy will never change until one day, we hit a revolution.

This liberal philosophy of individuality is promoted and defended in all our institutions. Classrooms teach an individual's human and property rights are hallowed. Boardrooms figure out how to indulge our wants with products like faster cars or bigger homes. News broadcasters tell us how good the economy is when we all indulge. They even have benchmarks like Gross Domestic Product and stock prices. Progressives vigoursly fight for individual rights like marriage or minority rights. Conservatives do the same thing for property and gun rights. And many of the stories we watch promote all this individuality. When was the last time you saw a story about political compromise, or what would happen if America restarted the military draft, or the self-sacrifice of a gay man staying in the closet to keep his family together.

I like to think Western Rome, after starting it's story in 8th Century BC, was just tired. It had gone through so many different ruling philosophies, first with kings, then republics with consuls, senates, and tribues, then back to viritual kings called emperors. Rome warred constantly, with themselves in dozens of civil wars, and with countless tribes and empires. They integrated countless people's and beliefs into their ruling philosophy. Rome went from their own pagan religion, to adopting the Greek mythology, to changing their founding story to be the Trojans, before adopting a pacifist cult called Christianity as a state religion.

They did all this while building a civilization we still envy today. Rome's cities, agriculture, commerce, aquaducts, buildings, literature, military, and politics still give us many lessons. Alas, it was a series of grand stories from Romulus, Pompey Magnus, Julius Caesar, Cleopatra, and Jesus Christ, to so many more.

Maybe Rome just wanted a conclusion. After nearly 1,500 years of working at it, there was no more ways to adapt its ruling philosophy again, and motivate its characters to act inside yet another grand story. I personal get the sense that if they'd discovered more of the world, they might have been excited by the adventure of exploring it. But as it was, Rome's story had been in the same setting for thousands of years. What other story was there to live? And so the Roman people/characters slowly didn't bother, and let backward barbarians take over. This is only an impression of mine. Rome needed the New World, like we need Mars.

Our real life stories are very confusing. We're often like Sophie not sure which what is right or wrong. Is humanity naturally good, but corrupted by society. Or is humanity naturally corrupted and saved by society. That question, in many variations, consumes lots of thinking

I think the answer is how we solve problems. We only ever solve a problem with technology. A story about being lost, oppressed, and hungry, is only solved with technologies like compasses, reading, and farming. I use technology as a catchall term for any tool, be it material like a bucket, structural like a building, or biological like a hand, or mental like reading, that life uses to solve a problem.

Life makes us solve problems as it fights off death. And to solve problems we invent technology. Everytime we overcome a problem with technology, life wins. My problem is how do we learn to master revolutions. and for that i want to tell you a story.

And this is the story of humanity, and of this book. How do we spread technology, and learn...

Need to factor in revolutions...

That's the power of stories. No matter their size, they can change the world by giving us information in a easy to understand way. A story is a person solving a problem through a series of events that are ordered into a beginning, middle, and end. We always know what's happening and why. That's why we kids to seniors love stories. It's a way to get, and give, knowledge.

Naturally good if free from calamity. Or bad, as the husband showed. Ruling philosophy doesn't help.

First let's look at the lessons. Unless we're facing starvation, or some calamity, many people will be good like Sophie was. Life wants us to help each other, because that only helps life survive. Yet, freedom can't alway be good. The husband was free and he used it to enslave others.

The ruling philosophy is no help either. Most people will follow the rules with the rest of the crowd. While dissenters will often dissent for the sack of it. Thus, during a person's life, there's still no way to know if following or dissenting, is good or evil.

Plots don't help. If you told this story in the Southern States, in 1842, Sophie would have been a bad person turned good. If you told it in England, she'd be a good person turned bad.

Inside the stories of our lives, we thus can't always trust our personal instincts, the instincts of society, or the events of our lives, to tell us what's good or evil. This confusion makes it easy to believe good and evil doesn't even exist. Or to constantly be surprised.

Image yourself Sophie, following Frederick as grew to worldwide fame. She went from being good and evil, several times as America kept changing it's definitions. What was she, as a honest person trying to be good, to do? People are often left adrift looking for answers.

Gladly, life is a grand story with certainty. Life knows what's good and evil. Life is good, death is evil. To fight against death, life can't rely on characters, or plots, because both have no inherent goodness. So how does life free us to our natural goodness, without the assholes messing it up?

Sophie may not have always been good. She didn't dissent when she should have. But she still _did_ good when she taught Frederick to read. And that's life answer to the uncertainty of good and bad inside characters and plots.

Technology is always good.

Many people were made slaves because of words. Many people make themselves slaves with the words they read.
Nobody was ever made free with ignorance. Technology is the manifestation of life inside a lifeform, or object used to help life survive death.

And this is the story of humanity, and of this book. How do we spread technology, and learn...

Need to factor in revolutions...

Douglass relatively liked living in Sophie's house. He didn't want to go back to the Maryland farm. And he feared going to the huge plantations in the Deep South. Why? He was owned under contract of property in all three areas. Why did slavery have levels of evil? Proximity. Living with people, working in small farms, and slaving away in huge plantations meant owner and slave experience each other differently. Proximity to evil, meant more interactions to force out the good. Thus, even though the ruling story of every area allowed slavery, life broke through the closer two people actually touched. This is why uneducated outsiders like Sophie, and young kids, taught Frederick to read.

Now who do you think the people who farmed your coffee, made your fancy car would think is the protagonist and antagonist? Do you appreciate the extra effort making another disposal cup, or adding leather to a steering wheel as if the person was right beside you?

Fine, it's not your fault the global supply chain is fucked up. You probably own stock in some of the large companies, but I'll concede most people don't want to be Darth Vader. That's why we buy fair trade coffee, and drive electric cars.

What about your workplace. Do you think the future you, reading this in Star Trek, will envy your 9-5, with an hour drive in good weather, dealing with asshole customers, paying for a house you can't afford, working for one of our many Blockbusters with unknown bosses who can't even play a DVD. Try and better yourself like Douglass did, make an app, and see how the bosses at Blockbuster respond.

You can't say the past is evil, while being like Sophie and accepting the present ruling philosophy is good. The ruling philosophy, the definitions of good and evil inside our society, are not dependable. They change inside every microstory. Some are better then others for sure. But life doesn't work it's magic there. Life always needs to fight evil. So this is how it always does.

## Catch and Release

One day, many workers from another department were asked to visit a hotel. Hundreds of people filtered in, and were directed to the conference room. Actually two conference rooms; either #101 or #102. Each room had water bottles and snacks. Yet why two rooms? Friends in each were texting back and forth, comparing, trying to spot the differences that might reveal the reason for their divide.

About 45 minutes later, Human Resources representatives appear. One group in each room. One says "you all have jobs", while the other says "as we all know, technology is advancing greatly, and this inevitably means automating lots of jobs. Like Netflix, we all love Netflix don't we, well unfortunately...".  A mass firing of front-line workers.

It hit so hard, we adjusters felt it. Especially since it kept happening. The supervisors felt the bern. The SNAP-SNAP-SNAP-SNAP got a little faster. Everyone got extra hooked on being sure they'd pay the rent.

## Skywalker Prologuee

Seriously. Let me explain. Life needs us to fight off death by solving problems like disease, hunger, ignorance, and barbarism. Life gets what it needs, by making us live stories; because stories are about a hero character (you) solving a problem through a series of events inside of a plot. Each story has a protagonist, and antagoninst, Luke Skywalker, and Darth Vader, battling for their version of good, against the other side's evil.

When _we_ write the story, it's easy to know which side is which; that Skywalker is the hero, and Darth Vader and his Death Star space station are evil. Imagine if _Star Wars_ showed the families of the "bad guys" on the Death Star that Luke Skywalker blows up. Millions of families suffered so many hooks, yet the audience celebrates because a few thousand rebel "heroes" were saved. Because we humans wrote the story, we can slant it that way.

Yet in real life, we are not writers. We can't control anything but our characters. We can define evil within our own micro-stories. But to answer the general question "what is evil" is impossible because in the grand story of life, all of it, we're always just a character living micro-stories.

With so many lifeforms, living so many stories, who's to say what's best for life? Maybe we can collect many stories into a decent definition of "good and evil", yet no human written story like a religion or ideology will capture all of life's good and evils. There's too many contractions. It would be like Luke Skywalker commenting on a romantic comedy, mystery murder, and a coming of age movie, and expecting to be the hero in all stories. Skywalker is only the hero in _Star Wars_. Maybe he's a jerk boyfriend, or bad witness, cheated on his school exams, or just an extra.

===

## Hooks

Writers call your first impression on a story, "the hook". If it's memorable it's called the hook. If it sucks it's called forgotten. When I got a new job answering phone calls and processing car insurance claims for people, it sucked. But a job's a job, and I was hooked on paying the rent.

People has a double meaning. People, as in the people who paid thousands of dollars in case they needed much more after a car crash. And people, as in the corporation that took the people's money, promising to return it if needed. My job was claims adjuster, a sort of guardian of the people's money. You talk with customers, get their accident details, verify their account is active, get repair estimates, and send the check. The job was kinda like a bank teller, or Blockbuster rep; mostly talking with customers, doing paperwork, managing long queues, and working business hours. The job of adjusting hadn't changed much since the 1980's.

One constant hiccup was getting the details. People don't call claim departments with happy stories; it's often ones filled with hooks about crashes, robberies, and broken bodies. One day a coworker answered a call; car crash, followed by a car fire. The customer was stuck inside. Double hook.

His wife Jane Doe called in, with no idea what... what... what does anything mean anymore. Unlike 911 calls, people aren't frantic. They've had time to consider everything. They need guidance to understand so many hooks. Often adjusters were just shoulders. Adjusters quickly learn to throw away the mandatory talking points and just talk like a real person.

With 40 phone calls a day, dozens of faxes and emails, we processed hundreds of claims a week. You get used to the complaints about long hold times, or high insurance rates, but evil stories hook you too. So when our coworker was done with the call, we all looked at her with empathy. Now she needed someone else to take the hook off her shoulders, and...

BEEP!... BEEP!... BEEP!... BEEP!... BEEP!... The supervisor was ringing his bell, what he used to tell us "get back to work, answer more phone calls!". Lots of customers were waiting. The insurance company sells a contract. It's the front-line workers, adjusters, job to be the ones to honour that contract, and deal with whatever hooks we get. We just had to hurry up about it, and answer more phone calls, send more faxes. Like Blockbuster, we had to be sure customers could access their DVD's when we wanted them to.

## Wikipedia

Wikipedia lets anyone start and edit an article. You know about Galileo using his telescope to change the world, contribute what you know. Because Wikipedia's software tracks every change, graffiti is erased faster than vandals can make it. The result is an ever growing "the sum of all human knowledge." In a common trend of the internet, technology now lets millions of the people contribute small bits of work, to make a massive whole. Linux, Andriod, Firefox, Ruby on Rails, Deno, Wikipedia, and so much other cool stuff is made by faceless people, avilable for free, because so many people are hooked on being a protagonists contributing to a good cause.

Of course this is in contrast to Blockbuster. The DVD is a one way street. It makes people extras, having to pay, and be regulated, by the gatekeepers we called Blockbuster. Wikipedia is a two street. It fosters collaboration.

But who should be allowed to make a Wikipedia entry? I think everyone but short people. They usually have chips on their shoulders. Which is ironic because they're so close to the ground. If you defend them, remember Wikipedia is the "sum of all human knowledge", how much can short people really add?

This may seem ridicules, but a generation ago, contributing what you knew wasn't done in a click. It was years of trials before esteemed judges with long names like Distinguished Chair of Knowledge, Professor Emeritus George Doe of The University of Loans. The sum of all human knowledge was held behind walls at Blockbuster, called Enclyopia Britannica, or Oxford Dictionary. Only university graduates would be approved to work there. The poor, minorities, unlucky, sick, or maybe even short people could be easily excluded. After all, the institutions made their own rules. They had their own BEEP! with due dates, required readings, and fierce competition to rise into the hierarchy of esteem.

Wikipedia's first version was supposed to mobilize these experts. It was called Nupedia and had all the features of Wikipedia. In it's first year Wikipedia had forty thousand articles. Nupedia 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11...12.

Thousands of universities, professors, students, spending hundreds of millions dollars had the opportunity to give the world their knowledge, and they didn't. I was at an "elite university" then, studying the history and political philosophy of technological changes. The greatest lesson I got was seeing Wikipedia openly mocked for not being elitist. Professors were like the priests who rejected Galileo _because_ his telescope made knowledge easier to understand.

Blockbuster vs. Netflix. Universities vs Wikipedia. Taxis vs Uber. Hotels vs AirBnB. Insurance companies vs. Somebody Soon. There is something else going on. Every new transformative technology has a antagonist. Why are new and better technologies getting attacked. Professors, business owners, priests, managers, are hooked to using old technology, yet masked it with prestige built up from being gatekeepers. Protagonists, antagonists, battling for control of the grandstory of our civilizations.

And the extras stuck in the middle trying to pick a side.

## Who Are The People

Wikipedia isn't perfect. But when a person wants to learn something, Wikipedia, or Khan Academy, Udemy, or YouTube, is very likely good enough. They're usually almost free. We can pick what we need to know. And our success depends on learning the solution to the problem that had us looking for help. No grades, no admissions test.

In contrasts, universities, while still doing some really good work, are so much like Blockbuster. Needed and used until better technology like Wikipedia or Netflix comes along.

The point is, have we learned that lesson. I mean, if you write, edit, curate 20 Wikipedia articles, that are read by millions of people, is there even a word for that like "university gradute"? Will you get a job because of your contribution?

Anonymous contributions worked good enough Wikiepdia. It's worked in other places in society. Anyone can upload a YouTube video, make something for sale on Etsy, upload computer software to GitHub. Services like Uber, and AirBnB now help people get paid for using their own property differently. We're empowering anyone to be protagonist with modern technology and contribute what they can. Or are we?

Because whilst at work, I got sick of all those hooks, and all those BEEPS!. So I had an edit to make, and how many people know about car claims adjusting. So why not contribute an upgrade.

So, what if we didn't pretend it was 1980's anymore? Maybe we could make the claims department work faster, and thereby help everyone. My contribution was suggesting we stopped using fax machines. Because thousands of times a week we faxed documents to other insurance companies. Why not go online?

The answer from the experts was the same as Nupedia, Blockbuster, a definitive no. Actually it wasn't a no. It was a review process that never ended. An unconscious allergy to new technology, hidden behind the prestige of old technology.

## Your Hook Into Wikipedia

And this is where you and I, as members of the same society, have a hook inside the same story. What happens next? I have this helpful contribution, that maybe a thousand adjusters would use. But it would help hundreds of thousands of drivers after a crash.

Yet that edit could't be made. It was refused by the experts. I'm not here to argue about my job. You ever use a fax machine 10 times a day? That says enough. The outrage is realixing how often this shit is  happening.

Inside our economy we're called customers and workers. We're told to be extras each time, there to service the. But really we're collaboraters. I, the adjuster, and talking with Jane Doe after her husband died. She needs to access her own (insurance) money, and needs my help to get it. What the fuck are the experts there for if we can just look up answers on Wikipedia, or stream the movie from Netflix.

No big deal? My little app idea, extremely simple, dead simple using code freely available on GitHub, in one year would save 2.25 million phone calls, 12 million minutes of waiting on hold, 100,000 of unpaid adjuster overtime hours, and 100 million insurance dollars. Even better, we'd start making a database of all insurance claims. So we could start learning, and therefore preventing, why crashes, and car fires, happen. Amazingly something so simple isn't already done. It would help so much. Instead I heard silence, and of course BEEP-BEEP-BEEP.

I always had a hobby of writing politcal philosophy since leaving university. Specifically, the politics of the share economy. I was gonna release it in short bursts I hoped a few hundred might read. Fuck it. People are literally dying in car crashes every day, getting burned alive inside their own property, and I'm getting BEEP-BEEP-BEEP by experts who want to pretend it's 1980. The Blockbuster economy refuses, like the religious priests of old who refused to look through Galileo's telescope, to update to new technology. Their ignorance inspires revolutions.

This book is my contribution to that bullshit. I'm hooked to it.

## Happy Netflix Customers, Happy Blockbuster Employees

The divide between closed access DVD technology, to open access internet technology defines the divide between happy and unhappy. Because for the vast majority of our economy, we still work at, and use the Blockbuster way of life. Although increasingly the masses know the Netflix way of life is possible.

To be fair everyone resists upgrading _their_ job. There's a phenomenom of "I want to work at Blockbuster, and I want to use Netflix" in our society. Lots of people want to keep getting paid for the Blockbuster fees, while having to pay the Netflix costs. This happens because there is no official plan to transition to the Digital Age, Netflix economy. Thus people working at the Blockbuster's throughout our economy are scared.

Practically speaking what can the average person do. Most people don't, and will never work at "Netflix". Netflix is so cheap and efficient because it doesn't need much manual labour like stocking shelves, managers to open and close stores, HR reps to do the intake forms for new employees, and executives doing deals with their piers over whatever. No lobbyists to lower minimum wage, no unions to fight against it, activists to protest the smog from deliver trucks. Still, how does the middle class, who likely works for the  ruling nobility, pay their bills while building the Netflix economy of the future?

Good thing we don't have too. The player god doesn't wait for anyone. He keeps playing the game. Thus, just like Netflix, the Netflix economy already exists. We just need a new Digital Age philosophy card to click we'll democratization of our functions like insurance, news, and politics.

### Romeo and Juliette Triangle

![Romeo and Juliette](img\ch1\triangle-baking.png)
**Romeo and Juliette:** Two great families really don't like each other. The feud is like boozing to an alcoholic, no purpose but it feels great anyway. The feud goes on until two youngsters catch each other's eyes across the battle line. The setting is wealthy Renaissance Italy. The passions are hatred contrasted by love. Dialogue reinforces the us versus them dynamic, and especially the love story. The antagonist is both family's tradition of hatred. Thought is mindless hatred juxtaposed by soulful love. Two kid protagonists rise above and risk everything for their passion. Love winds up killing them but also the feud that kept them apart.

## THE STORY OF GEO AND HELIO

So that is story. We live stories whenever encountering, dealing with, and solving problems. Since the middle class live problems everyday, we often live inside a story. Thus by understanding stories we can understand our reality. We don't have proof of that yet. I'm saying stories are a lens into human reality, that's quite a statement, but there's no technology to show you. No telescope. It's like when Friar Bruno told people the truth about the solar system, he just had reasoning; the rationality of irrationality. So let's make the telescope into our reality. A piece of technology that shows us the moons of Jupiter. Let's use a story we already know. The one between geocentrism and heliocentrism.

Let's set the stage. The Renaissance.

The Renaissance was a cultural movement that profoundly affected European intellectual life in the early modern period. Beginning in Italy, and spreading to the rest of Europe by the 16th century, its influence was felt in literature, philosophy, art, music, politics, science, religion, and other aspects of intellectual inquiry. Renaissance scholars employed the humanist method in study, and searched for realism and human emotion in art.

Renaissance humanists sought out in Europe's texts of Antiquity, while the Fall of Constantinople (1453) generated a wave of émigré Greek scholars bringing precious manuscripts in ancient Greek, many of which had fallen into obscurity in the West.

Renassaince artists strove to portray the human form realistically, developing techniques to render perspective and light more naturally. Political philosophers, most famously Niccolò Machiavelli, sought to describe political life as it really was, that is to understand it rationally. A critical contribution to Italian Renaissance humanism Giovanni Pico della Mirandola wrote the famous text "De hominis dignitate" (Oration on the Dignity of Man, 1486), which consists of a series of theses on philosophy, natural thought, faith and magic defended against any opponent on the grounds of reason. In addition to studying classical Latin and Greek, Renaissance authors also began increasingly to use vernacular languages; combined with the introduction of printing, this would allow many more people access to books, especially the Bible.

We need a protagonist. Let's use Bruno. Copernicus and Galileo are famous enough. Bruno's life could fill volumes. He was a protagonist in every sense of the word. He rose above the predominiate thought; Aristotialn and Christian theology. Born in 1548 he became a priest in 1572, studied theology in a monastary, getting his doctrate in 1575. He was investigated for his controversial views, and was soon frustrated enough to fle his monastic order in 1576. He was excommunicated and spent the next 16 years travelling western Europe.

Bruno was poor. He worked at a printer, he taught Latin, and did what he needed to make ends meet. He wanted to teach philosophy at a University. He did for a few years before Protestants kicked him out. He was a known rebel anyway which probably didn't help getting hired. He was smart and caring, but had a hard time getting passed the interview. He wouldn't wear the mask of professionalism others could with ease. That's probably why all three major  western religions, Catholics, Calvinsits, and Lutherans, all excommunicated him. That's like the USA, the Soviet Union, and Iran all hating you. Can you think of anyone today with that achievement?

If you met Bruno you'd know why he's so distinguished. He wasn't easy to deal with. Ever talk to a homeless man? Not the one having a good time on drugs or the one drifting from place to place until he grows up. The quiet guy who walks around a lot, probably keeps a pet, could use a shower and haircut if he could stop to look at himself. But he doesn't care about what he looks like. He's too busy thinking about his own world. Thus, he's a perfectly nice person, means harm to no one. Content with himself. Never wanted to interview anyone. Never wanted to be interviewed. That fake world of masks, pretension, and manners is boring. It's not real. And whatever you bribe him with won't be enough because the homeless man won't even look at your material rewards. Fake is fake, and his unique reality is more interesting. So walk around he does, thinking of reality that only he knows. He loves when you agree with him, but he can't get many people to understand because can't describe it to you exactly. His reality just fits him so well he doesn't know how to explain it. So he doesn't. A perfectly nice person.

Until you take him out of that reality. Until you tell him that reality isn't real. That in fact he's living the lie. That he should change. Then you'll see the nice man become a guardian and defend his reality like a parent defending a child. All he has in the world shall not be taken away. No moderation is possible. Stubborn, asshole, foolish, crazy, many names label that man. It's best to leave the man alone, let him be, and let him live.

If you've ever talked to someone like that, if that sounds familiar, then you've talked to Friar Bruno. The difference is Bruno didn't have a unique reality in his head he was happy to live within. He had a reality in his head he demanded others live in. That's why Bruno's life wasn't spent walking around Naples, minding his own business. It was spent writing, lecturing, debating everyone and everything in all of western civilization. He pissed off everyone. Bruno was kind of right, but we remember him more because he was the tip of the spear.

Here's why.

He had constant realizations of a new reality in his head. He struggled to make the reality in his head real for everyone else. He suffered during his journey. He was rewarded with publications and fame, and punished with scorn and infamy. His life was a drama. He never gave up. Many people were his antagonists. Occasionally regular people with their stubborn beliefs, but usually it was high ranking clergy and political leaders who attacked him, usually with dialogue in spoken threats or written condemnations.

He used dialogue to fight for his reality. Writing many books, having many debates, giving many lectures, and finally a trial for his life. He had great passions, and he used tools of pen and paper, writing and speech to interface with the world he wanted to change.

Bruno's life had a plot, a beginning, middle, and end. An end point that controlled everything else inside. Convince the world of something he could never prove. Bruno wanted to create, or destroy, a Death Star that didn't exist yet. Bruno needed the telescope to prove himself. The absence of a telescope make his personal story a tragedy. He could never have won. He never stood a chance. Yet his mental story was a full blown victory. He is a protagonist of history.

Bruno's life was a functional story. He too wondered about reality like Neo in _The Matrix_. He received variations from the infinite Universe and compiled them in his head. He saw an error in the typical thought in his day.

The lessons is many. Bruno didn't have one story, one antagonist, one realization, or one suffering. He's life was complex, varied. Life isn't a single story, but hundreds of simultaneous stories. Yet each is still just a story. Some are art, spectacle, and functional.

Even more fun is the size of story. Or the length. Some stories can be told in real-time, some are about days, weeks, or years. And some can be about generations and even epochs. So to do the stories of real life. Because our stories are inside these varied time frames. Some conclusions impactful, some almost meaingless. Sometimes we learnt the lesson, sometimes we can't find meaning in our lives like so many audiences of art films.

## STORIES GLUE THE LEVIATHAN TOGETHER

The above are Aristotle's story elements. They make up stories like atoms make up elements. Now we have to use these tools, to understand our real lives. Let's start if off when

You might have noticed something interesting.

Each step has more meaning behind it. The first steps are somewhat superficial. For example it's easy to take a picture of an item or someone using an item. Now try taking a picture for rules, antagonist, thought, protagonist, plot and it gets progressively harder. The story elements get less material and more meaningful. The reader must be conscious of the story for each level's picture to make sense.

![Consciousness](img\ch1\story-triangle-consciouness.png)

So stories are compacted consciousness. Thus if a story is well told, and especially if it's an archetypal story, as we experience stories, we share consciousness. That's why stories are the way in which society's community about their ruling philosophy.

You really need to be consciouness of the story to understand higher levels. So lower levels are material, and get more immaterial with each step. That's why plot is vital, the sequence of events gives higher purpose to items and people who themselves don't mean much.

[![Characters with plot vs no plot](http://img.youtube.com/vi/https://youtu.be/FxKtZmQgxrI?t=406/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/FxKtZmQgxrI?t=406)
_Star Wars (1977-1983) contrasted with Star Wars (1999-2005). The original movies were well told. The characters lived inside a healthy plot. The new movies are not well told. Characters don't have a plot to give them life. They have less consciousness. You can see the difference in this nice breakdown._

So, what's above plot? What's more immaterial then plot? Look again to consciousness.

Here we come back to the archetypal stories. In each archetypal story there's a higher purpose. Like Cinderella fighting to go from rags to riches, Frodo's journey to destroy the evil ring in the _Lord of the Rings_, or the moral rebirth of Scrooge in _The Christmas Carol_. Archetypal stories exist because they're so like our real lives. Life inspires fiction and fiction inspires life. There's a reinforcing cycle. You've been the hero of your own movie many times. You've been the hero of other people's lives too. We are often motivated by archetypal stories. The thing that inspires fiction and real life is, life. Life is the thing about plot in every story.

## Conclusions are black holes

Conclusions are our black holes. A back hole is so powerful both physical worlds of gravity and quantum mechanics co-exist. Since functional plots are a reasonable course of events they are like gravity; reasonable and predictable. Functional characters act with reasonably understood emotions, so are comparable to the somewhat understood world of quantum mechanics. This analogy helps understand conclusions are like black holes. A place so powerful both reason/plot, and emotion/character co-exist with shared importance. Inside our black holes we have the creation of new realities, but only when Aristotle's story elements are aligned inside a functional story.

Why do protagonists care so much? Luke Skywalker was one kid on a farm, what are the chances he'd make a difference fighting an evil galactic empire? Romeo and Juliette were like 15, and they died for each other? Was Neo's life of solitude and poverty inside the Matrix worth it to find out he's a slave? The answer is yes, it's why we remember their names.

We love these protagonists because they're archetypes. Fiction inspires real life protagonists, and real life inspires fictional protagonists. Both real and fake archetypes want to make the world a better place. That means overcoming problems inside a functional story.

Functional stories come from our eternal need solve problems. That's why spectacle and art stories never reach archetypal status. Spectalce and art are inspired by humanity to serve their passions. Only function serves a higher purpose of questioning our reality to make the world a better place. We venerate archetypes to inspire us to do the right thing. We need to connect with the consciousness of those who solved our problems before us. A time when the items, passions, dialogue, antagonists, and thoughts were different, but the plot was the same. Solve problems, defeat the bad guys on the way to a better life.

![Super-plot](img\ch1\story-protagonist-higher-calling.png)
_A person moves from item to a protagonist when they ignore all existing story elements and get inspired by a higher calling._

I like to think our soul drives us forward, but you can fill in any other kind of higher calling you like. Whatever it is, a higher calling inspires protagonists to make reality a better place to live.

We love these protagonists because they're heroes. Fiction inspires real life protagonists, and real life inspires fictional protagonists. Both real and fake heroes want to make the world a better place. That means overcoming problems inside a functional story.

Functional stories come from our eternal need solve problems. That's why spectacle and art stories never make history status. Spectalce and art are inspired by humanity to serve their passions. Only function serves a higher purpose of questioning our reality to make the world a better place. We venerate heroes to inspire us to do the right thing. We need to connect with the consciousness of those who solved our problems before us. A time when the items, passions, dialogue, antagonists, and thoughts were different, but the plot was the same. Solve problems, defeat the bad guys on the way to a better life.

## Camels in the Amazon

Now let's put humanity inside life's evolution. You might have noticed some similators. We mimick life's evolution with our technology. And our dreams are visions of the adaptions we need to make real, through our own microstories.

Now I were to show you a desert fox in the Artic, a dolphin in a pond, or a camel in the Amaxon you'd automatically see something wrong. Not with the lifeform, we take our kids to visit all of them in the zoo, but you'd see something wrong with the mixing of a lifeform into a foreign ecosystem.

Now I were to show you daily newspapers in England, gasoline cars in China, or McMansions in America, what would you think? Nothing, despite England have few paper mills, China no oil fields, or Americans having no desire build and clean mansions. You wouldn't see the same mix match between lifeform/adaptation and it's ecosystem. You wouldn't see foriegn lifeforms because you wouldn't see different ecosystems.

That's because right now, our society is still stuck in the immediate growth part of economics. The grasses, weeds, and ferns that life rushes in, so it'll secure itself against entropy. The stiff competition, and ownership of property rights are exactly what happened in politics and economics. With politics it happened after Clovis (453) I to Charlemagne (800) secured Western Europe after Rome's collapse. To create the grasses, weeds, and ferns, humanity was forced into strict roles of feudal king, priest, knight, gentry, and peasant. Feudalism fostered the beginnings of political life. The nobilities descendants then passed on their political control right via inheritance, despite the fact the political situation was much different by 1500. Europe actually had enough political freedom, enough political "carrying capacity". Humanity had to enter the political ecosystems via revolutions.

After we did, we have enough carrying capacity left over to make economic grasses, weeds, and ferns. We let economics being owned by the first lifeforms to find prosperity. We encouraged their growth via economic property ownership, which was to be passed on via inheritance. And like in nature, and politics, once we had enough carrying capacity, we will start making economic ecosystems.

But for now we are camels trying to live in the Amazon.

## Insurance Money

Let's find out. It's not a simple question. Who was I working for? Picture yourself at the side of the road, car's smashed, you've paid $15,000 in insurance money, and you need it back. So how should this work?

Today after a car carsh, you need to get (insurance) money. That means calling a 1-800 number during business hours, waiting on hold, and eventually talking to an adjuster. The adjuster gets the accident details, check's your account, and eventually send's a check. The entire process takes a few weeks.

Adjusters process dozens of phone calls, emails, voicemails, and faxes a day. It was hilarious learning how to fax something. Did you know the fax machine (1865) was invented before the telephone (1876), and we’re using both to process claims for people who just had a real-life NASCAR experience-gone-wrong in the 21st century.

This doesn't tell us who owns insurance money. But it does tell us who doesn't want to give it back too quickly. Among the approximately 10,000 calls I answered over the years, one call stands out the most. A car crash, and the young driver died on impact. Slide on ice. No one to blame, just a lifetime of unanswerable questions for the father. The father was geniunely lost. So was I. Unlike 911 calls, the people aren’t frantic when talking to an adjuster. They’ve had time to consider everything. They need guidance. Adjusters quickly learn to throw away the mandatory talking points and just talk like a real person. Often adjusters were just shoulders.

I talked to this gentlemen about life, families, my future, his, God and…

DING!… DING!… DING!… DING!… DING!… The supervisor was ringing his bell, what he used to tell us “get back to work, answer more phone calls!”. In the age of super computers and high speed interent in everyone’s hands, this asshole is ringing a bell, so I’ll… Send faxes faster?

So the question of asking who owns insurance money, led me to ask, who do I work for? The person who needs their insurance money to repair their life, or the company tasked with protecting it? Is this bell, fax machines, and 1-800 number the best this gentleman’s annual $2,000 insurance payment gets him. Why is modern technology like WhatsApp and Skype nearly free, while thousands of dollars gets faxes and telephones.

## Prologue intro

Writers call your first impression of a story, “the hook”. Hooked means exactly what it sounds like. Being controlled, in this case by a good story, but in reality, you can be hooked by anything in your life. Like being in love with Juliette, or working to cure cancer. Most people are hooked on paying their bills, and thus are hooked on having a job.

I'm one of them. I've been a movie usher, a projectionist, a officer clerk, a drywaller, a claims adjuster. And I'm probably going to have a bunch more before my story ends. Now I want to scream about these jobs. Even though I enjoyed most of them, I can't help but remember their stupidities. Like how movie ushers spend 90% of their time picking up garbage, but can't ask customers to stop dropping it. Or how claims adjusters talk about car accidents days or weeks after they've happened, with people who had a smartphone at the accident! I want to talk about how much of my story I've wasted on these stupidities.

But I know all workers have the same problem. Work is often stupid. We laugh at it when watching shows like _The Office_, because having a job is confusing, because who do you work for? The person who needs help to watch a movie, or process a claim, or the company paying you? The customer and the company are not the same person. And the worker is stuck in between trying to make both happy.

The truth is every worker isn't working for either. They're a specialist in a technology, be it a projector, or a drywall knife. Every movie theatres has customers, watching a movie from a projector. Every insurance company has drivers, processing claims at a call-centre. Technology is the greatest hook of all. And we're all controlled by our chosen technologies success and failure.

I'll show you. Did you know Wikipedia had a sister called Nupedia. With Nupedia only “expert” professors could make articles, while Wikipedia let anyone contribute, but tracked every change to help erase any errors or vandalism.

Conventional thinking said people would go to the experts. They after all had a history of being in control of society's books of knowledge. Well the first problem was the experts didn't like to share. In their first year, Wikipedia had 40,000 articles. Nupedia had 12. The second problem was it turned out "expert" answers, and answers, are actually the same, Mount Everest is 8,848 metres high nobody who says it. And Wikipedia was far better at finding and sharing answers. Now Nupedia is long dead, Wikipedia has millions of articles, and books of knowledge have turned into Wikipedia searches.

This isn't a simple lesson. I was at an “elite university” when Wikipedia was spreading, learning about the philosophy of technological innovations. The best education I got was seeing the experts antagonize their own futures. Few professors could undertand regular people were experts of something, and were happy to contribute, share, and trust their knowledge. With the right technology, the people could educate themselves.

Yet even professors were threatened. Even though Wikipedia was just a better encylopedia, it doesn't do advanced research, they still couldn't admit Wikipedia's technology is better. Heck, hundreds of thousands of students write term papers every year, that are graded and thrown away. Some could just as easily write or improve Wikipedia articles.

But no. Instead Wikipedia is still mocked, even through it's simple better than books. It was like watching Blockbuster laugh at Netflix because the DVD was the future of movies (which Blockbuster did), or Xerox give Apple the designs for the personal computer because the photocopier was the future of office work (which Xerox did). Now 15 years after Wikipedia started, it's joined by even more technologies, like YouTube, Khan Academy, Udemy, all of which are slowly replacing lecture halls, libraries, and even universities.

So we are all slave to the technology we use. What does this story look like? Because workers still need to pay their rent. So they resist modern technology, while needing it to improve their lives. Otherwise we'd still be buying enclopida's that get old within a few years, renting DVD's, or calling an insurance company to make a claim. The Blockbuster's of the world, universities, printing companies, claim departments, refuses to update to new technology. Their ignorance inspires revolutions.

## Prologue - Notice How Much Darth Blockbuster Likes to Party

Why wouldn't professors, who exist and are paid to research, like to share knowledge. Why wouldn't AT&T want more communication running over its network. Why wouldn't Xerox want personal computers. Why wouldn't Yahoo want to search the internet. Why wouldn't Blockbuster like to help people watch movies faster.

Because these institutions, once on the cutting edge of technology, slowly became filled with Darth Blockbusters. Darth Blockbuster is not a worker on the front-line trying to do a better job. He's a self-entitled piece of shit.

At least that what it seems like. In reality, he likes to party, because he can't foresee a new society, One based on the new technology. Thus Darth Blockbuster defines success by their climb up established institutions hierarchies, as being esteemed princes and executives. They antagonize the grandstory of civilzation's invention of new technology to maintain their status. They use prestige of past heroes to hide their self-entitlement. Supposed divinity, exclusivie parties, stuck-up language, and fake titles are his defense.

Protagonists doubledown. People like Galileo who foresaw a world of science, Alan Kay who foresaw a world of personal computers, and Paul Baran who foresaw a decentralized internet of computers, keep fighting for a better civilization despite so many antagonists.

Thus, my parents aren't protagonists because they fight on top of skycrapers. They're simple curious, smart, hard working, and most important selfless. They showed me middle class extras become protagonists when they embrace new technology. While so many professors, managers, and executives at my jobs would insist university, DVD's, and call centres were the future, despite all the evidence otherwise, my parents, like so many middle class people, would just shut up and learn new technology.

New technology brings new capabilties and thus questions who should hold the power over it. Workers always have a job to do, and thus care about being a better builder, cleaner, or adjuster. While "managers" and "executives" sub-consciously know, nobody has ever had a problem and said "does anyone know any good executives?".

Every organization needs management. But excessive management is a sign of bad technology inside a company, country, or civilization. It means the jig-saw puzzle making of technological creation has stopped to keep the antagoinsts party at full throttle. Thus, new technology constantly empowers individuals to become protagonists and do away with Darth Blockbuster.

Wikipedia is an obvious example. It costs basically nothing compared to our college system. Yet with no official support from anyone in power, and very little management, it's built a knowledge-base that's amazing. And this "Wikinomics" is transforming our civlization by empowering extras, who need far less managerial oversight, because protagonists regulate themselves when freed to live their own mission.

GitHub is like a Wikipedia for computer programs. It lets anyone download and update software. Before GitHub programmers were mostly wage labourer extras. Now their supercharged protagonists who program Wikipedia, Linux, Firefox, and other extremely powerful software, that's free for anyone to use. Before Netflix came along, it was internet "thieves" that introduced online streaming to the world. Community made content on Khan Academy, YouTube, and Udemy, educate for virtually free.

These examples are a few pieces of the jig-saw puzzle the future needs us to build. New technology upturning old industries is a recurring story throughout human history. It happened with politics. The key to victory was always to empower the extras to become protagonists on the side of new technology. To do that requires a new idea to attract the extras. The new idea is for extras to see their leaders as antagoinsts, holding everyone back from moving forward in the grandstory.

New ideas are the job of philosophers. People who go back to basics, and make a new storyline with a new philosophy. If their words are magic enough, they make the extras realize they should stop watching the story, and instead become a protagoinsts by picking up a weapon, and start fighting. One of the best examples was the American and French Revolutions which empowered individuals to wiki their politics, and they were inspired by the magical writing of Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

## Prologue Douglass

Think of Douglass' story. When it happened in 1841, hero and villian switched depending on geography. In the agrarian American South, Sophia would have been a comedic extra for trying to teach a slave to read. Hugh would be a hero for defending slavery. The northern abolitionists would be Darth Vader trying to destabilize the entire economy. And everyone would scream as Douglass got on the ship "he's getting away!".

At the same time, in the industrialized North, people disliked slavery. But not out of morality. Their dislike was because slavery was competition for their own paid work and the machines they loved to build. Hugh was thus maybe a jerk, but not a villian, Sophia should have learned the Southern way, and Douglass should stay away from Northern jobs. In fact trying to keep slavery out, or in, of new American states like Kansas was what sparked the American Civil War (1861-1865).

However, at the same time, the British hated slavery. Hugh was a villian, Sophia was a coward, and Douglass was a glorious protagonist. Douglass actually helped make sure Britain didn't recognize the American South as a country, depriving a powerfulally to the slavers. Also, it it was Irishmen who gave Douglass the money to buy his freedom. Thus, if you lived in the American South, North, and British Empire, all places with similar cultures, you'd see Douglass story three different ways.

And this is how we Today our microstories still have this uncertainty. We simply don't have the perspective to all agree on the same protagonists and antagoinsts. Think of all the things we've fought over since Douglass. Segregation, affirmative action, diveristy training, gay marriage, gun rights, global warming, health insurance, union rights, abortion, migrants, foriegn factories, refugees, capitalism, communism, fascism, environmental regulations, conservatives versus progressives, neo-conservatives vs conservatives, progressives versus socialists, and so many more issues. We keep battling each other, everyone fueled by visions of being Luke Skywalker striking down Darth Vader.

- With institutions by asking why wouldn't professors like to share knowledge. Why wouldn't AT&T want more communication running over its network. Why wouldn't Xerox want personal computers. Why wouldn't Blockbuster want people watching more movies.

It's often called the innovator's dilemma. The more successful a tool gets, the larger the institution needed to support it. It's like buying a bigger house and watching the expenses pile up. But with companies expenses are product lines, buildings, employee contracts, management levels, and other "weight". Many people inside will scream how weight makes solving the tools original problem of "telecommunications", "knowledge", and "storytelling" lost in red tape. Large institutions have bills to pay and using increasingly old technology to pay them is an inconvenient truth. Foresight is a luxry. New technology is a threat.

Some people are natural Darth Blockbuster's. They selfishly want success but are too stupid or risk averse to invent new tools to earn it. Yet, large institutions breed many more antagonists because of the innovator's dilemma. Think of all those Blockuster regional store managers, or better yet, all those PhD students of Film Studies, and Geography. Can these experts upload their knowledge on Wikipedia. Maybe, but they definitely want their money back. And that means promoting a prestigous university to the next generation. Old tools become a hot potato nobody wants to be left holding.

This is actually good news. Conquering large institutons is easier than conquering human selfishness. We just need to keep inventing new technology, like Wikipedia, to undercut bygone institutions. While this may suck for those invested in the past, it helps anyone who plans on living in the future.

## Frederick Douglass

he story gets even better. Frederick quickly found friends in the north free states. A radical Christian minority called abolitionists who took the Declaration of Independence literally when it said "all men are created equal".

It wasn't long before Frederick was at a hall of these freedom lovers. People, like his once upon a time angel Sophia, who treated him as a man. These people ignored the clicking of society's rules and wanted to hear him speak. In a time with no pictures, no movies, no telephones, Douglass was the source of knowledge they couldn't get. What was slavery really like? Are blacks really dangerous? Are slaveowners cruel? What is the truth?

Frederick rose and spoke. His oratory matched his bravery. He spoke again, and again and again. Douglass told everyone what Hugh said to Sophia to make her follow the rules; "if a slave learned to read, he would learn about the world, and the slave would become unhappy with his condition and desire freedom." Douglass said this was the first anti-slavery speech he had ever heard. Sophia thought she could be a good citizen to Maryland, a good wife to Hugh, and a good person to Douglass, by keeping him ignorant.

Frederick Douglass took the lesson well. He spread his brilliant oratory beyond the sound of his voice, in the best way. With words. He wrote many books, and he wrote them so well, it clicked millions of people into a new set of rules. Slavery is evil, _all_ people are equal. You can read it now in many books. It would make Douglass happy you educated yourself, and understood why these are the good rules.

Another is how poor the rebel armies were. A reflection of the society, they were always hungry, short of supplies, and even shoeless. The war's decisive battle at Gettysburg (1863) was fought because the town had a shoe factory the south wanted to raid.

If you see war as a battle of tools, the south had slavery, the north had machines. One needs ignorance and oppression, the other education and innovation. Frederick

## Personal blah

The key to empowering the extras is giving them the tools. It wont be easy. I studied the question for a while while working a host of front-line job. I made a new tool that saved about 100 million in operating costs for an industry. I didn't want any fame or fortune, I just wanted to empower co-workers to have better workdays, and some time to write a boring philospophy book.

Getting it approved by the power-brokers was like talking to Darth Vader. They never even asked the extras on the frontline. Instead always found a reason why the new tool was wrong, and the old tool was right. I was supposed to sing and dance for them. Instead I wrote my philosophy book like a rallying call for the extras. And made a new app that will save tens of billion in operating costs and return it to the middle class, so we can all sing and dance to our own music.

For example, the movie theater is a nearly dead storytelling tool in our society. That's not an opinion, I worked inside empty auditoriums for years. However, mass media and studios ignore this, among other ways, by bragging about high "box-office grosses". A movie's gross includes currency inflation, ticket price and population increases. It's meaningless to gauge popularity year over year. Ticket sales are far better, but those are kept secret.

Frontline insights like show how contemporary philosophies don't matter. Although actors are often proud progressives, and corporate businessman often staunch capitalists, they work together to keep a dying tool alive. The difference between good and bad guys is simple proximity. When you count empty theatre seats because you feel the pain of less shifts, while at the same time, you feel the pain of full theaters overflowing with garbage, you wish for a better way, and thus want a better tool. The further you are from the frontline, the more you filter out the truth with things like movie grosses, gender equality, or some other philosophical.

## Movie Theatres Vertival Integration

The movie industry should be solving this problem. It tried throwing money at it with 3D movies, but 3D tell bad stories. The short answer is theatres and studios are separate industries who hate each other. They should unify like Apple Stores, and start working together to give people an affordable night of entertainment. But they can't without questioning who should be in control. So the higher ups in both dying industries hide inside movie grosses.

The lesson is, only the people who count empty theatre seats because they feel the pain of less shifts have a good reason to make changes and invent new tools. In this case live entertainment, cheaper prices, story quality control, double features, affordable food all work well. The further you are from the frontline, the more you filter out real problems.

And here you can see the cast of characters. People on the frontline with the incentive to make new tools, with people in positions of power around the old tool, who don't. This happens on most every new tool. Frontline workers like game developers, taxi drivers, or hosts love Steam, Uber, and AirBnB, while the higher up you go in retail game stores, taxi companies, and hotel corporations, always find reasons to stop it.

## Fight with the recap of chapter, too long

Let's reflect a little bit on our civilization's story. Humanity has a stream of problems like cold, hunger, and disease. We solve them with tools. To solve them better, we need new tools.

Protagonists respond. Of course they do, they're heroes. They use new technology to invent new tools to ease the pain on the frontline. Their continued self-sacrifice slowly empowers people so we all solve our problems with better knowledge, efficiency, and dependability.

Then we have antagonists. Tools develop a power structure, and we reward people for rising in it. Thus, when protagonist's new tools undercut the power structure, antagonists selfishly respond to defend their wealth, power, and prestige.

Antagonists often manage companies or institutions based on dated tools. They look down, but unknowingly fear, working on the frontline because feeling its pain invalidates their old tools.

Lastly we have the extras, everybody in the middle of a battle between two tools. Because they have no direct interest they can pick winners and losers. Usually extras are in the middle class; not so poor as to be desperate, but not so powerful they want to keep the world the same. Sadly, extras don't realize their power.

This is a archetypal human story. Galileo fought a religious establisment with a telescope, George Washington fought a political establishment with a musket, and Steve Jobs fought a economic establishment with an iPod. Nikola Tesla, Marc Andressen, Elon Musk are other heroic examples. Each protagonist was lucky enough to win over the extras.

And that's why you need to stop watching and start fighting. It is important to remember the story is about supporting new tools, not fighting a group of people. Dated philosophies are the bullies against "bankers" and "lawyers", "rich" and "poor". We fight problems, and thus fight _for_ tools, not against groups of people who may or may not be antagonists.

After all, our lives cut across many poblems and tools. We can be a protagonist for a new tool, an extra for many, and even an antagonist for a few. For example, while professors were antagonists to a better encyclopedia, many of Wikipedia's facts were discovered by professors, so they're hardly pure villians. Fight for better tax laws, road traffic, health care, the same way we fought for a better enclyclopedia, by supporting better tools.

To empower the extras in real time, they'll need to see antagonists in real-time. AT&T, Xerox, Blockbuster, would all like a trip into a time machine instead of being cautionary tales. Without one we have to wait for historical perspective to tell us who the antagonists are.

Until now. We need to empower extras to either support the good guys either as extras or protagonists. So in _Techvolution_, we'll have to learn how to tell the difference between good and bad tools. Thus, we'll spot antagonists in real-time. Real villians in need of a proper fight. Ones I call Darth Blockbuster.

## Professors no like Wikipedia for coursework

Typical of the story, Wikipedia was a small and unskilled hero, mocked by the established experts who refused to support "publish now" being open to the masses. I was at university when Wikipedia was taking off. It was amazing seeing self-described experts antagonize their own futures. I saw it most when asking why students couldn't be assigned Wikipedia articles to write or update.

They laughed at the idea. I wondered why. Academia is paid tons of money to find and document knowledge. They love to compete to publish obsure bits like "Is Film Noir a Movie Genre" to publications only their friends read. So why did the professors need to delegate millions of assigments, labs, and term papers, read them once, and throw the knowledge away; only to re-delegate the same work the next semester.

Wikipedia's mission statement is "Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge". In retrospect, but only after paying my tuition, I think I figured out why universities did not want to join Wikipedia's community. Another lesson from the frontline.

## Definitions

Protagonists: they selflessly invent, spread, and use new technology to make new tools. Usually close to the frontline, they individually struggle, but their continued self-sacrifice slowly improves life on Earth.

Antagonists: selfishly resist new tools to defend their wealth, power, and prestige. Antagonists often manage companies or institutions based on dated technologies and think working on the frontline is beneath them.

Extras: everybody in the middle of a battle between two tools. Because they have no direct interest in either side, they can pick winners and losers. Usually extras are in the middle class; not so poor as to be desperate, but not so powerful they want to keep the world the same. Sadly, extras don't realize their power.

## movie theatres

For example lets use movie theatres. They're a dying storytelling tool in our society. That's not an opinion, I worked inside empty auditoriums for years. However, mass media, theatres, and studios total ignore this, among other ways, by bragging about high "box-office grosses". A movie's gross includes currency inflation, ticket price jumps, and population increases. It's meaningless to gauge popularity year over year. Tickets sold are far better, but those are kept secret.

Frontline workers can't hide behind economic stats. Empty seats automatically mean less shifts. Changing the tool, movie theatres, makes sense to a frontline work. As does faster checkout lines, cleaner theatres, and better movies. However, entertainment reporters, movie marketers, industry spokesman, government regulators, can hide behind "rising movie grosses", thus defend their control over the tool, and thus antagonise change. Why rock the boat if you feel no pain?

## tribal politics

They did during industrialization when tools were mass produced because everyone worked in a highly interdependant economy geared towards mass production of tools. Businesses, bankers, workers, regulators,shared the same interests, and thus needed tribal politics.

Yet, tool making in the digital age is so easy and powerful, we don't need to huddle into massive groups of red vs blue, rich vs poor, owner vs worker. Everyone can be the hero of their own story because we can make custom tools for each individual problem. We can understand your travel requirements so you avoid traffic. Know what exact food will optimize your health. Specifically educate you on what you need to know. Customizable tools is a fundametntally different political and economic story.

## johnny's story

I was raised by parents who fled the communists of Eastern Europe. Their loveable mentality was people should work only when there's free time. Kidding aside (not really), they showed me how important tools are. Building a house, installing an air conditioner, cleaning a job-site, is simply using, many tools. The more the better.

I tried to keep this work ethic alive in my jobs. I was a newspaper boy, a movie theater usher, a projectionist, a bunch of factories and warehouses, an office clerk, an account manager, a claims adjuster. I was happily one of those co-workers you sometimes forget about because they just do their job.

That's why I'm (grudingly) grateful a nagging stutter made me too shy to leave the frontline. In retrospect, it's a great place to see where protagonists and antagonists come from. Frontline workers need tools because they do - either the house is there, or its not. Thus, they're natural protagonists

## How I Got Here

I'm nobody special. I was raised by parents who fled the communists of Eastern Europe. Their loveable mentality was people should work only when there's free time. Kidding aside (not really), I worked construction, cleaning, been a movie theater usher, a projectionist, a bunch of factories and warehouses, an account manager, a claims adjuster. A nagging stutter made me too shy to leave the frontline. I was happily one of those co-workers you sometimes forget about because they just do their job.

For a while I was a face painted ideologue but stopped when I realized I was still taking the bus regardless who won. I formally and informally studied the history and philosophy of technology for years. When I thought I knew my stuff, I made a new tool for an old industry. My little app was cheap, effective, and saved tens of millions of dollars. I was rightfully proud of it, and wanted to share my wisdom. But I didn't know shit. I was an extra up against gatekeepers.

I won't go into details. There's no need. If you've used Napster, Netflix, Lyft, Skype, Kickstarter, GitHub, AirBnB, or Firefox, you already know how empowering our new digital tools are. Many protagonists have worked hard to create the new tools of a wonderful new reality, but antagonists keep stomping on it. I'm happy I got bruised up. It taught me a new philosophy.

Now I feel like Galileo looking through his telescope and seeing the Earth revolve around the Sun. I took my small political wisdom, mixed in limited tech experience, added the bruises, and out of the oven came Techvoluion.

Stories sometimes need new languages for their new worlds. Ours needs a new philosophy. I made one for you. It was hard, but still way easier than dealing with those damn antagonists.

## IDK

Until we master making new tools, each new one will be made by a small group of protagonists obsessed with solving a problem in a better way. Many stronger, richer, and prestigious antagonists will suppress it build up prop up its existing tools. For example, Blockbuster used email, teleconferencing, and had a website, but wanted people to drive back and forth to its stores instead of pressing "watch now".

We will master our the creation of new tools when the extras realize their power. Because unlike an audience, extras are in the story, and thus if you realize your power, you can pick winners just be choosing the tool you want to use. Happily the extras fought for Wikipedia, online streaming, Telsa, and the rest already mentioned.

But there are millions of tools today not so lucky. So many of our problems, like rampant unpaid overtime, not sleeping enough, incomprehensible tax codes, expensive formal education, endless road traffic, glass ceilings, exist because the tools that'll solve them are repressed. The extras who care think "fiscal conservatism" or "democractic socialism" will help, the ones who don't binge Netflix. In truth all the extras have the same power to turn make lightsabers. Just by joining the battle over new tools.

## We Need A New Philosophy

Right now regular people are either obsessed with red vs blue politics, watching professional sports, another Marvel movie, or binging on Netflix.

It's no ones fault. Really it isn't. No one is to blame. We're extras because our society uses old philosophies. Until someone invents a new one, we're stuck with ones like conservatism (1781), progressivism (1868), marxism (1856), and free-market economics (1776).

We're using philosophies founded to help the world industrialize. Before rubber shoes, indoor plumbing, and electricity; when humanity could only mass produce a few tools like wood barrels, steam engines, and pencils. Businesses, bankers, workers, regulators, rightly needed highly interdependent philosophies.

Yet, tool making in the digital age is so easy and powerful, everyone can be the hero of their own story. We can understand your travel requirements so you avoid traffic. Know what exact food will optimize your health. Specifically educate you on what you need to know. 3D print your new hammer. Customizable tools is a fundametntally different political and economic story.

Using philosophies born when the moon was our nightlight is holding everyone in our society back. Even main characters in politics and business are suffering. Especially them actually. After all they have to try and motivate voters and employees to care using philosophies that can't.

Just look at the the recent shake ups. The Tea Party, Move On, Brexit, Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, Proud Boys, Antifa, Yellow Jackets. These aren't an accident. They're the result of our old philosophies not solving everday problems like road traffic, climate change, and shaky employment. Leaders think we're breaking the rules. But we're looking for new philosophy to improve our lives.

While I hope our leaders and political junkies likes it, if you're sick red vs blue politics, sick of being an extra, I wrote this book for you. Keep in mind, a new philosophy is a big deal. It's like writing a story for all society to act in. We'll go step by step.

## Personal Note

If you liked _Skin in the Game_, _Rework_, _Zero to One_, _The Great Degeneration_, and _The Innovators_, you'll probably like this book. These books are amazing and helped me make this one. And by the way, I never forgot about my little app. It got bigger and it'll be the lightsaber for the middle class. But more about that later.

And to Darth Blockbuster. You're not evil. But you can't work at Blockbuster and get to use Netflix. Because if everyone thinks like that, our entire civilization stays filled with Blockbusters, and that's fucking horrible. Nobody wins.

Moreoever, will all benefit inside a society that works for, not against, new digital tools. Politicians will govern more and fundraise less. Executives will lead us to the future and stop grinding out quarterly earnings. Marketers will brainstorm about cool new tools more instead of doing the ten millionith car commercial. Activists will empower the poweless with tools instead of marching and yelling.

Our wondrous digital technology will give us this bright future if we embrace it. Saying that, if you still want to scream at political rallies about Marxist ideology, or sit in a corner office and delegate work like Charles Montgomery Burns, that's on you. The digital age is one of individual empowerment with new tools. Help update our society, or be everyone's villian.

## misc from prologue

Teach or study at an expensive university lecture hall and you'll fight to keep it alive by saying government should pay; and thus be a old school socialist. Work in at Blockbuster with vanquishing DVD sales, you'll lobby both political parties to attack online streaming, increase tax-credits, and lower minimum wages. Make candy apples, and you'll tell everyone to eat candy apples.
