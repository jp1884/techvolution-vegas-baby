# Prologue

I wrote this for the people on GitHub, Wikipedia, Udemy, Stackoverflow, Slack, Dribbble and wherever else you open-source Jedi gather. Learning your ecosystem of digital tools was cool. Learning your philosophy was even cooler.

You've change the world. Most people just don't realize it yet. They still think stuff like news, manufacturing, and education is only for government or big business. Yet because of you, there's countless digital tools for _the people_ to control their own lives. It's truly a new world. One where Cinderella goes to the ball simply because she wanted to have fun.

You're like Yoda! I'm being serious. Whether its moms learning to repair iPads for extra cash, laid off workers learning to program solar panels, or parents teaching their kids, you've empowered regular people to become protagonists.

I'm one of them. I'm a lone politics, history, and philosophy geek who spends his days thinking about what's coming next in the story of civilization. With Firefox, Project Gutenberg, YouTube, and Wikipedia I can do my own research. With Markdown, VS Code, and Ghost I can write, design, and host my own work. With Word and Figma I can collaborate with world-class illustrators and writers to make it better. This book is a byproduct of your own ecosystem.

The old world is worth leaving. I helped clean office buildings as kid. Picking up the garbages and blue bins before going off to read PC Gamer. Years later when working inside a cubicle the cleaners were short staffed. Management spent hours meeting about the "garbage problem". Their solution? More meetings.

Funny for, but really sad when you've seen the openness, accountability, and work ethic of open-source. It's not perfect. Some people are dicks, projects die off, politics gets involved. But that's humanity only by diving us freedom, as open-source does, do our virtues flourish.

Open-source can't cure everything. Huge universities, corporations, and militaries started the digital revolution and aren't going anywhere (nor should they). However, open-source is the next step in human evolution because it's a check against middleman from these organizations becoming delegating obsessed gatekeepers; like when a few hackers introduced us to internet streaming when Darth Blockbuster wanted us to keeping borrowing his DVDs.

Open-source are the modern minuteman. They should be self-sufficient. But organizations like Wikipedia, Mozilla, Khan Academy. Channels like Real Engineering, CodeCademy, and Traversy Media. The countless people uploading to NPM, RubyGems and elsewhere often need donations just to keep going. All while old tools like universities, television broadcasters, and movie studios get massive subsidies, tax credits, and bailouts.

This great difference signifies our society's great divide. Open-source heroes invent new tools to improve civilization, while the people who control CDs, paper-forms, and call-centres, antagonize upgrades dethroning their place atop the heirarchy and sending them back to equality.

At first I only wanted to learn about open-source. Now I want to liberate it. Because to keep changing the world, you can't just _make_ new tools; now you have to _replace_ old tools too.

Telecommuting, right to repair, home power generation, internet privacy, accident-proof cars; a new world is right there, literally at our finger tips!

We need a new philosophy to get there. Regular people can't use typical "red/blue" politics. These philosphies are very outdated. Their believers march and yell like its Woodstock in 1969, because technologically speaking they love 1969 and thus like Darth Blockbuster's old tools. The potential of digital tools is as lost to him as books, guns, and telescopes were to a Bible thumping Darth King.

Open-source doesn't agree. You all feel the “majic” of new tools but have a hard time explaining why; because humanity still doesn’t understand how our “cyborgology” changes us when we pick up a radio, a smartphone, or a lightsaber (one day!). That's why I turned your unspoken philosophy into a new political philosophy. Like a web framework, it uses terms like “Darth Blockbuster”, “Death Star rule book”, “Jedi vs Sith” to make it easier for the struggling middle class to understand the true political question of our time.

The question isn't "are you for red, or blue, politics?". But "are you for, or against, using digital tools to upgrade our way of life?".

Like fans of an aging sitcom, the people are distractedg by the "dark majic show" of the bombastic political rhetoric, car commercials, fantasy football stats to notice they're in a new digital world open-source is happy to make for them.

Our job is to make them gaze up from main street and realize they control society (the "Leviathan" ruler in the drawing), because society is controlled by them, _the people_.

Our opportunity comes when a regular person has yet another problem with their tax forms, car radiator, ashphalt shingles, or whatever old tool the antagonists are keeping alive. This is when the pain of living on the frontline makes regular people search for a better way to live.

This moment is where I want to empower open-source. Because this is where all its coders, designers, writers, and contributors can replace old tools by saying;

  >You don't need to live with this. You don't need to yell at the TV or hope "change" will happen next election. My friends and I invent new tools so you can improve your own life... They're more cheap, respect your privacy, and are controlled by the people. You can use them. And better yet we could use your help... because it's our own ruling philosophy holding us all back.

And if the regular person asks what they heck you're talking about, you can tell them to read Techvolution: A New Philosophy; then go back to changing the world.
