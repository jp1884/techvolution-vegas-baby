# Prologue

I wrote this for the people on GitHub, Wikipedia, Udemy, Stackoverflow, Slack, Dribbble and wherever else you open-source Jedi like to gather. Learning your ecosystem of digital tools was cool. Learning your philosophy was even cooler.

You've change the world, the world just doesn't know it yet. Most people still think stuff like news, manufacturing, and education is only for government or big business. Yet because of you, there's countless tools for _the people_ to control their own products, identity, and lives. It's truly a new world. One where Cinderella gets a ticket to the ball because... everyone does.

You're like Yoda! I'm being serious. Whether its parents educating their children, moms learning to repair iPads for extra cash, or laid off workers using Rails to make their own business app, you've empowered regular people to stop hoping for a better life and become protagonists making a better life.

I'm one of them. I'm a lone politics, history, and philosophy geek who spends his days thinking about what's next in the story of civilization. With tools like Project Gutenburg, VS Code, and Ghost I can research, write, and host my own work. With Word and Figma I can collaborate with world-class illustrators and writers to make it better. A few decades ago I'd be searching book indexes, scribling on paper, and praying a publisher looked my way.

I helped clean office buildings as kid. I picked up the garbages and blue-bins because it was so easy. Years later when working at a big office, the cleaners were short staffed. Management spent many hours meeting about the "garbage problem". In open-source there's no one to delegate to so... there's nothing to meet about, so magically, no problem would even exist.

Open source still can’t run the world. Read The _Innovators_ and Walker Isaacson will explain how the trifecta of academic institutions, private corporations, and the military was perfect to create the digital revolution. Likewise, it was for profit companies, academic institutions, and open-source programmers who kept it going.

But open-source is the next step in human evolution because it's a check against antagonists in these organizations holding back new technology from society; like when a few hackers introduced society to internet streaming when Darth Blockbuster wanted us to keeping borrowing his DVDs.

Open-source are the modern minuteman. The guardians of the people's interest and betterment. They should be self-sufficient. But the countless people contributing articles, feedback, and code often need donations just to keep going. All while old tools like banks, television broadcasters, and movie studios get massive subsidies, tax credits, and bailouts.

This huge difference signifies our society's great divide. While open-source heroes invent new tools to improve civilization, many antagonists build gates to keep the people away from the party.

At first I only wanted to learn about open-source fight. Now I want to empower it. Telecommuting, right to repair, home power generation, real internet privacy; a better world is waiting once open-source realizes it can't just _make_ new tools; you have to _replace_ old tools too. It's new tool vs old tool. Jedi vs. Sith.

We need a new philosophy to win the fight. Neither open-source or the people can use typical "red/blue" politics anymore. These philosphies are very outdated. Their believers march and yell like its Woodstock in 1969, because technologically speaking they love 1969. The potential of digital tools is as lost to him as books, guns, and telescopes were to Darth King preaching to his choir.

Open-source loves new technology. You feel the "majic" of new tools but have a hard time explaining why; because humanity still doesn’t understand how our "cyborgology" changes us when we pick up a radio, a smartphone, or a lightsaber (one day!). That's why I turned your unspoken philosophy into a new political philosophy that works like a web framework, that condenses ideas into terms like "Darth Blockbuster", "Death Star rule book", "Jedi vs Sith" to make it easier for everyone to understand the true political question of our time.

It's not "are you for red, or blue, politics?". But "are you for, or against, using digital tools to upgrade our way of life?".

The people don't see this question because they're too used to being Cinderella watching the powerful people party behind closed gates to. Worse, the people are often too distracted by the "dark majic show" of fantasy football stats, fancy car commercials, and bombastic political rhetoric to realize they're in a new digital world with no gates. Our job is to make the people look up from main street and realize their new digital powers.

Our opportunity comes when a regular person has yet another problem with their tax forms, car radiator, ashphalt shingles, or whatever old tool the antagonists are keeping alive. This is when the pain of living on the frontline makes regular people search for a better way to live.

And this moment is where I want to contribute to open-source. Because this is where all its coders, designers, writers, and contributors can swell our ranks by saying;

  >My friends and I invent new tools that are affordable, super powerful, and controlled by the people. And we need your help... because it's our own ruling philosophy preventing these new tools from improving your life.

And if the regular person asks what they heck you're talking about, you can tell them to read Techvolution: A New Philosophy; then go back to changing the world.
