# Prologue

I wrote this for the people on GitHub, Wikipedia, Udemy, Stackoverflow, Slack, Dribbble and whatever else you internet Jedi are working on. Learning your ecosystem of digital tools was cool. Learning your unspoken philosophy was even cooler.

You've change the world. Regular people just don't know it yet. They still think stuff like news, manufacturing, and education is only for government or big business. Yet because of you, there's countless digital tools for the people to take control of their own lives. It's truly amazing living in a time when Cinderella goes to the ball simply because she wants to have fun.

You're like Yoda! I'm being serious. Whether its moms learning to repair iPads, or laid off workers learning to code, you've enabled extras used to watching stories, to become protagonists in their own lives.

I'm one of them. I'm a lone politics, history, and philosophy geek who spends his days thinking about what's next in the story of civilization. With Project Gutenberg, YouTube, Wikipedia, and Edge I can do my own research. With Markdown, VS Code, and Ghost I can write and host my own work. With Word and Figma I can collaborate with world-class illustrators and writers to make it better. My book is a by-product of your ecosystem.

Academic institution, corporations, and militaries kicked started the digital revolution, and aren't going anywhere (nor should they). But it's open-source that's the next step in human evolution because it's a check and balance against middleman making gates to the party; like when Darth Blockbuster tried to keep us all driving to pick up and drop off DVDs.

Open-source should being growing. But organizations like Wikipedia, Mozilla, Khan Academy. Channels like Real Engineering, CodeCademy, and Traversy Media. The countless people uploading to NPM, RubyGems and elsewhere, often need donations just to keep going. All while old tools like universities, television broadcasters, and movie studios get massive subsidies, tax credits, and bailouts.

This difference signifies our society's great divide; the Sith fight to put up gates so people keep using his old tools like CD's, DVDs, road maps, lecture halls, gas cars, paper insurance forms, and the always busy call-centers because he owns these tools, he profits from these tools, and he has no idea what Javascript is, so he never wants his users to leave and send him back to equality.

Then there's open-source making new tools to usurp gates and distribute power to the people.

At first I only wanted to learn about open-source's work. Now I want to liberate it. Because to keep changing the world, you can't just _make_ new tools; you have to _replace_ old tools. Thus, it's you _versus_ them, it's Jedi vs Sith. There’s no difference between the soldiers who fought Darth King George III and you, the modern minuteman who work so regular people can empower themselves and better their families.

You all feel the “majic” of new tools but have a hard time explaining why; because humanity still doesn’t understand how our “cyborgology” changes us when we pick up a radio, a smartphone, or a lightsaber (one day!). That's why I turned your unspoken philosophy into a new political philosophy. Like a web framework, it uses terms like “Darth Blockbuster”, “Death Star rule book”, “internet Jedi” to make it easier for the struggling middle class to understand the new world you made for them.

We need a new philosophy. Neither regular people or open-source will go anywhere with typical "red/blue" politics. These philosphies are very outdated. Their believers march and yell like its Woodstock in 1969, because technologically speaking they love 1969. Gas cars, nightly newscasts, 9-5 work days, two car garages; their ideal way of life is a never ending _Simpsons_ episode. But no one's going to tax-cut or flower-power their way past the future's antagonists.

The true political question of our time isn't "are you for red, or blue, politics?". The true question is "are you for, or against, using digital tools to upgrade our way of life?".

Darth Blockbuster fears open-source because he can't own it. And he does so with the outmost sincerity and conviction that he's a “martyr of the people”. The power of digital tools is as lost to him as books, guns, and telescopes was to Darth King. Although they’re usually very well-intentioned people who follow the rules, they can't appreciate the digital era has made them old lifeforms in a new ecosystem.

Like fans of an aging sitcom, the people are too used to seeing the "dark majic show" of the same political rhetoric, cable news shows, 60 Minute interviews, car commercials, fantasy football stats to notice the new ecoystem for themselves and swell your ranks.

My job is to make them look up and take notice.

Our opportunity comes when a regular person has yet another problem with their tax forms, car radiator, ashphalt shingles, or whatever old tool the antagonists are keeping alive. This is when the pain of living on the frontline makes regular people search for a better way to live.

This moment is where I want to return the favour and empower everyone in open-source. Because this is where all its coders, designers, testers, and contributors can gain a member by saying "I am part of the open-source movement inventing new tools to solve problems like this... and we need your help... because something is holding us all back".

And when the regular person asks what they heck you're talking about, you can tell them to read Techvolution, then go back to changing the world.
