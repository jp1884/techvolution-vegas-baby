# Game of No Restarts

Noble refuse to play evolution. In any game, the start resets after each contest. That happens when new tools are invented, but is rejected by the player who thinks he's gold medals are a birthright to his noble blood.

If a lie of omission is a lie, then lied to you a while back. In the evolution of cyborgs chapter, I told you evolution lives inside all lifeforms, making variations to constantly probe for environmental changes. This is how life adapts.

However not all lifeforms create variations. Because not all lifeforms have sex to procreate. Some clone themselves instead, called asexual reproduction. Some water fleas, scorpions, aphids, bees, even some fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds don't mate. Instead the femals fertilize their own eggs with their own genes.

Researchers are still studying asexual reproduction, but cloning helps lifeforms grow faster. Every individual can mother children. There's no competition for mates. No mating rituals. Just reproduction. It's very efficient.

But there's a reason why only 1 in 10,000 lifeforms reproduce asexually. Because there's no variations, any problem in one individual, like a disease or defect, exists in all individuals. Thus asexual lifeforms tend to explode, but then die off relatively quickly.

These lifeforms don't adapt. And we can see our fate, in their's. Because when we don't embrace new tools, we depend on old tools. We similarly clone them, and spread them throughout the world, and enjoy the good times of easy mass reproduction, until a fault brings the entire system down.
