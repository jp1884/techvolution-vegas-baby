# INTRODUCTION

Fighting to spread the power of new tools is an archetypal human story. Galileo fought a religious establisment with a telescope, George Washington fought a political establishment with a musket, and Steve Jobs fought a economic establishment with an iPod.

Likewise, I want to empower you with tools. Yet, this is not a book about how to invent tools. Amazing books like _Rework_ and _Zero to One_ already do that. Nor is it a book about the history of invention. _The Innovators_ does that better than I could dream. If you want brilliant critiques of our society, _The Incerto_ and _The Great Degeneration_ are already waiting for you. Instead, this is a book about how new tools empower society, and how we can distribute their power to improve the lives of regular people today.

It all comes down to changing the rules of our society with a new philosophy. Todays philosophies don’t mix well with modern technology. They consider us, the middle class, as extras. People who are just around to watch the story unwind around them. Even if we watch our problems pile up at home and at work, we’re not supposed to solve them until we pass through the gatekeepers of old tools in government bureaucracies, bloated corporations, lawyers officers, or consultant meetings. This is the equivalent of Blockbuster writing rules to protect itself and keep on reigning in an era of YouTube and Netflix; basically, the opposite of evolution.

Techvolution is inspired by Nature. Notice gatekeeper’s don’t exist there. Evolution doesn’t have anyone telling a cheetah she’s running too fast, that the ants are too cooperative, or that a camel is too water efficient. Lifeforms adapt as best they can to their own problems and the winners survive. There are no middleman, no gatekeepers, just problem solvers. And the problem solvers prevail.

Unless you're willing to wait millions of years we'll never evolve to fly, do advanced calculations, or breath Martian air. Human biological adaptions have effectively stopped. Humanity continues lifes evolution with tools. We're basically cyborgs who adapt and solve problems by upgrading our tools to the lastest problem in transportation, calculation, and breathing. Hold a plane joystick, calculator, or space suit, and you're a different cyborg each time.

However, our problem solving is held back by old philosophies that empower gatekeepers. People in control of old tools like Blockbuster, getting to decide when, and if, humanity will upgrade our tools.

In _Star Wars_, the Force is an all powerful energy field. Luke Skywalker's Jedi warriors harness the light side to help others. Darth Vader's evil Sith harness the dark side to help themselves.

We call technological protagonsts "trailblazers". Like Jedi, they empower us cyborgs with new tools. But since some gates are good, mainly the security ones, we don't have a good term for the antagonists. Thus, I call antagonists to our technological evolution Darth Blockbuster. They are the people who prevent human evolution for their self-interest.

For years we've called biological upgrades and adaptions evolution. I call human technological evolution _Techvolution_. This book is about inventing Techvolution, a philosophy to re-write the rules of society, to kill Darth Blockbuster, so regular people can solve our problems with technological upgrades as smoothly in human society, as natural selection does in nature.

And to make it happen, you, the current extra, have to join the fight. Because victory depends on you picking the right side between an old ruling philosophy, and this modern one called Techvolution.
