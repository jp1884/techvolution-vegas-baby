## Foreword

My oldest child enlisted in a beginner Spanish class. Spanish is his mother tongue. He wanted the class for an easy credit. The teacher got wise, and so tested his knowledge. She showed my son words of colors written in Spanish but typed in a different color.

For example:

- <p style="color: red; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px">"White"</p>.
- <p style="color: grey; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px">"Purple"</p>.
- <p style="color: blue; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px">"Red"</p>.
- <p style="color: orange; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px">"Yellow"</p>.
  
The teacher then asked my kid to quickly say the color each word was written in. It's an easy task if you don't know the language, but near impossible if you do. Even if you're pretending ignorance, you mind reads the word. My kid was soon found out and took the advanced class. I laughed when he told me the story. I advised him to take a lesson from it.

The lesson is you should never devolve; it's a mindset only for the doomed.

That's the reason I still read this book today in 2083. I never want to go back.

I often forget that _Techvolution_ was as transformative as it was. Was humanity ever so backward? Did ideology control economics the same way religion once did politics? Were people slaves to their personalities instead of their achievements? Could someone interfere with a worker's evolution and call themselves a boss; and not an antagonist who never faced a customer's review? Why were there so many currencies that changed value every day? Would supposed teachers demand students not learn the latest technology in their studies because those teachers had jobs for life based on ancient technology? Would a person own a tool and not be allowed to repair it?

It is even more confusing for me to understand how regular people responded to their evolution being held back. They would watch fake ideological stories on a screen and call that politics. They would march in circles expecting things to change. Would they listen to antagonists justify stunted evolution in weekly meetings? Would parents really distract their kids with generic mass-produced items instead of demanding their God-given freedom to evolve?

I must always remember humanity once fought our evolution instead of our natural enemy.

Our true enemy is Entropy, the continual change of our environment through ice storms, hurricanes, plagues, solar radiation, and everything else making Life on Earth a precious work in progress. Every organism on Earth has evolved to stay alive for billions of years. Did humanity think we mustn't be vigilant?

Of course we must! 

Yet, we are not biological creatures. We evolve with technology. It was the antagonists in their fake stories of racism, sexism, and elitism that proved our survival on this lifeboat called Earth is not based on our biology. Anyone who ever preached biological superiority fell in the face of technological progress.

We humans outrace Entropy through the free and widespread creation, adoption, and replacement of technologies.

Before we protected our technological evolution as a sacred right, it's no wonder we suffered so many horrors. Events like civil wars, depressions, and revolutions were as common as plagues once were. These were violent jumps of our evolution that were like mass-extinctions of old ways of life. All caused because Life's demand of continual problem-solving was held back by leaders refusing to let go of old tools.

Evolution is a gradual and painless when its free to naturally select the best adaptions.

Yet delayed it once was. It's hard to believe mothers would let their kids suffer the resulting mayhem caused by preventing evolution. Instead, they'd work their life away to own a fancy car, McMansion, or have an imagined label like Prince and Executive.

I'd rather my kids brag about their planet than their house.

But that wasn't always the case. We now know delaying evolution is as immoral as theft. Like Galileo taught science over mythology, Jefferson freedom over servitude, and Darwin evolution over creationism, this book teaches us techvolution over ideology.

Human nature is not perfect. We still have many problems today. But at least we know to purge our souls of antagonism whenever it shows itself in our community. Like knowing a language, once you understand a way of thinking, you automatically see the world differently.

That's why I re-read this book. I never want to devolve into our past. I can do this because many brave parents changed our future decades ago. I thank all those dearly. Now we study and understand our ongoing story of technological evolution. Parents now know every kid has a goal to achieve, a niche to fill. 

Now, our kids don't fight ideological wars or suffer economic depressions.

Instead, they are busy working hard with other frontline workers, under minimal, open, and accountable oversight, using any tool they need. They are inter-connected by a technological ecosystem that is edging us closer to perpetual profit while evolving Life closer to our glorious future among the stars.

I helped my kids find their technological niche. And now I get to watch them achieve their very best. I advise them to re-read this book to be sure their kids will continue evolving mankind to our highest potential.

A happy and loving mother
