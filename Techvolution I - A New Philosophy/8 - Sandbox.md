## Prologue

The world needed to change. We felt in the cold. We felt it in the hunger. We smelt it in the desperation. Humanity fought back. We laboured in the Industrial Age to evolve out of a dreary existence.

After enough sacrifice was paid. When enough blood and sweat was spilled, we, everyone in Western Civilization, rich and poor a like, got to the summit, and unlocked new technology to live a better way of life.

The Internet Age was to be marvellous. A place of easy education, simple regulations, and perhaps the best part, a place where anyone can be a prince or Cinderella.

Yet this dream world was not allowed to be.

The powers of past had second thoughts. They buckled to hubris, and succumbed to greed. The protagonist of the Industrial Age decided he liked the world as it was. Darth Blockbuster thus forged in secret the rules he needed to keep his tools as the levers of power. These rules concentrate the legal departments, HR reps, corporate lobbyists of the Industrial Age as a Death Star to evolution and change.

_Federal government regulations. Another example of all the "Death Star" rules our Industrial Age establishment makes._

Yet there were some who resisted.

An open-source alliance of coders and designers rallied against the forces of stagnation, and together these heroes fought for the economic freedom of the middle-class.

There, on the firey and cold streets of Main Street, the rules and deception of the dark side, faced off agaist the innovation and creation of the light side, for the soul of America.

Endless hours of designing and coding made free websites, apps, and technologies for the entire world to evolve to a digital mass-collaboration economy.

Victory was near.

Yet, the powers of Lord Blockbuster could not be undone. Left/Right political pettiness, consumerism of useless products, and bullshit jobs were forced on society with the blasts of the mighty Death Star. The world was not allowed to evolve. And thus, the climate started to change, economic growth started to stall, and the people were so unhappy that depressions and despair covered the land.

It was in this moment. When all hope was lost, when the dreams of the Internet Age looked faded, when the chance to evolve seemed gone, something happened the antagonists did not intend.

The world has changed. I feel it in the water. I feel it in the earth. And I smell it in the air. Much that once was, is lost. For none now live who remember it.

We go to the most unsuspsecting of places. For the time will soon come when you, dear reader, will shape the fortunes of all...

The middle-class has to step up and upgrade our way of life to the Internet Age. We must fund, make, and grab hold of the levers of power the open-source community has created for us. Only then will we live in the era of mass-collaboration. If we don't, we'll keep suffering the pains of a degenerating society.

The biggest roadblock to the Internet Age is the gatekeeper Darth Blockbuster. The holdover from the Industrial Age and the antagonist of the modern era.

Darth Blockbuster stalls the future by writing rules to keep his Industrial Age tools, and himself, in power. These rules are like a Death Star. They concentrate the legal departments, HR reps, corporate lobbyists of the Industrial Age to keep antagonists in control.

Before our civilization can evolve, we need to defeat Darth Blockbuster and blow up his super-weapon.

I'll explain the philosophy we need to win, but whether you decide to continue is up to you.

If you're ready, keep reading. It's time to play the game and become a player god.
