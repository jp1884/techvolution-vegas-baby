## Foreword

My oldest child enlisted in a beginner Spanish class. It wasn't long before the teacher suspected Spanish was his mother tongue. To test him, she briefly showed him colors typed in a different color. My son then had to say the color each word was written in. 

Here's an example in English:

<div class="scroller">
   <span>
      <p style="color: red; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px">White</p>
      <p style="color: grey; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px">Purple</p>
      <p style="color: blue; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px">Red</p>
      <p style="color: orange; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px">Yellow</p>
      <p style="color: red; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px">Pink</p>
      <p style="color: brown; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px">Black</p> 
      <p style="color: pink; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px">Brown</p> 
      <p style="color: green; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px">Blue</p>
   </span>
</div>
  
It's an easy task if you don't know the language, but near impossible if you do. Even if you're pretending ignorance, your mind reads the word before seeing the color. My kid was soon found out and took the advanced class. I laughed when he told me the story. I advised him to take a lesson from it.

The lesson is you should never devolve; it's a mindset only for the doomed.

That's the reason I still read this book today in 2083. I never want to go back.

I sometimes forget that _Techvolution_ was as transformative as it was.

Was humanity ever so backward? 

Did ideology control economics the same way religion once did politics? Were people loyal to their personalities instead of their achievements? Could someone interfere with a worker's evolution and call themselves a boss; and not an antagonist who never faced a customer's review? Why were there so many currencies instead of using Nature's currency? Would teachers demand their students not use the latest technology because those teachers had comfortable jobs for life based on ancient technology? Would a person own a tool and not be allowed to repair it?

Understanding how regular people responded to their evolution being held back is even more confusing. They would watch ideological stories on a screen and call that politics. They would march in circles expecting their lives to improve. Did parents really raise their kids in suburban isolation while showering them with generic mass-produced items instead of instilling a God-given requirement to evolve better solutions to their specific life?

The hard truth is yes; we used to live this way. I must remember that. It's easy to forget humanity once fought our evolution instead of our natural enemy.

Our true enemy is Entropy, the catchall term for the continuous change of our environment through ice storms, hurricanes, solar radiation, and everything else, making Life on Earth a precious work in progress. For billions of years, every organism has evolved new adaptions to stay ahead of the nasty, brutish, and short-life Entropy can cause. Did humanity think we mustn't also be vigilant?

Of course we must! 

Yet, we are not biological creatures. Our race, sex, and genetics do not keep us warm or grow our food. Did the caveman start a fire with lasers from his eyes? Did Magellan map the world by flying across oceans? No we are not Superheroes. We are all biological vessels for technological evolution.

We, humans, outrace Entropy by learning the language of our fate; the free and widespread creation, adoption, and replacement of technologies. Our success has the same rules as normal evolution; speciation and unfettered innovation. Our most important identities are the tools we use to find our niche and earn a living.

The people who help our technological evolution are our allies; those who oppose us are our antagonists.

Seeing ourselves as biological beings had us chasing shadows. With new technology comes great power with great responsibility. Identifying in race, gender, genetics allowed technological powerbrokers to become gatekeepers. To hide their advantage, powerbrokers told ideological stories about racism, sexism, and elitism.

We were born free, but everywhere we had antagonized technological evolution.

Even with all their storytelling, antagonists always failed. They proved our survival on this lifeboat called Earth is not based on our biology. Anyone who preached biological superiority fell in the face of technological progress.

Following ideology caused us many horrors. Before we protected every individual's technological evolution as a sacred right and absolute obligation, events like civil wars, depressions, and revolutions were as common as plagues once were. With evolution antagonized daily, needed adaptations were held back like water behind a dam. Unsurprisingly, we had violent jumps in our evolution as violence washed away outdated societies.

Natural selection requires a daily and hour scrutinizing, throughout the world, of every adaption, even the slightest.

Harnessing technological evolution seems simple to us today, but it took a big change to get here. Galileo taught us science over mythology, Jefferson freedom over servitude, and Darwin evolution over creationism; this book teaches us techvolution over ideology. Techvolution teaches us to judge our politics and economics by measuring real-world problems and outgunning Entropy with democratized technological solutions.

Because of techvolution, today, we no longer have ideologies that encourage extremes and excess. Instead, we practice techvolution that promotes moderation and problem-solving. 

This change brought tremendous progress, yet human nature is not perfect. We still have many problems today. But at least we know to purge antagonism in ourselves and our community whenever it appears. Like knowing a language, once you understand a way of thinking, you automatically see the world differently. Gatekeeping a technology is a false god that, instead of being the source of power, leads to inevitable destruction. 

Now I must thank those who took the first leap. It was many brave parents decades ago who unplugged from ideology and ventured into the frontier to start a new society. Because of them, we study, understand, and promote the new modes and orders of our continual technological evolution. As a result, today's parents know every kid has an important goal to achieve and a fun story to live because, like in the natural world, there's always a niche to fill inside an evolving ecosystem. 

Now, our kids don't die in ideological wars, suffer economic depressions, and only rarely struggle with psychological torments.

Instead, they are busy working hard with other frontline workers under minimal, open, and accountable leadership, using any tool they need. They are interconnected by a technological ecosystem edging us closer to perpetual profit while evolving Life closer to our glorious future among the stars.

Along with their teachers and leaders, I helped my kids find their technological niche. And now I get to watch them achieve their very best. I advise them to re-read this book often to be sure their kids will continue evolving mankind to our highest potential.

A happy and loving mother
circa 2083

P.S.
I shudder to think of our fate had we continued to interpret our reality using ideologies that blamed each other for their shared ineffectiveness.
