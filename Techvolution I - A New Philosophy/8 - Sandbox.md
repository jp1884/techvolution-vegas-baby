When a magician makes a playing card disappear, we smile in awe and childish wonder. That's cool, but nothing new was created, so we soon lose our joy. However, when a majician connects someone with typing, drawing, or reading, they've similarly performed something awesome. They've upgraded someone's cyborgology, helped them solve problems better, and effectively created a new and improved person. This makes us smile for a long time.

In short, majic is Nature's long-lasting dopamine fix to motivate us to keep playing the game of civilization.

Yet human-made rules _sometimes_ say upgrading to a new tool is wrong. Medieval parishioners couldn't read a science book, French peasant farmers couldn't have a musket, a 1990's kid couldn't download a digital song. I can imagine only a few cavemen were "allowed" to hold the flint that starter the fire.
