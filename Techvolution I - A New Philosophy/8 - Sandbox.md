# Foreword

One of my kids reads and speaks Spanish. At school he wanted to take a beginner class for easy credit. The teacher got wise and so tested his knowledge. He showed my kid words of colors written in Spanish but typed in different colors.

So "blanco" was written in blue. "Morado" was written in green. The teacher then asked my kid to say the color of each type. If you know the language, it's impossible because your mind reads the word even if you're pretending you can't.

The lesson is, once you know something, it's impossible to go back. Not going back is the reason I still read this book today in 2083.

I too often forget _Techvolution_ was as transformative as it was. Was humanity ever so backward? Were economic leaders not elected? Could someone interfere with a workers evolution and call themselves a boss and not an antagonist who never faced a customer's review? Were there many currencies and each changed value every day? Would teachers demand students not learn the latest technology because those teachers had jobs for life based on ancient technology? Would a person own a tool and not be allowed to repair it?

Even more confusing for me to understand is how regular people responded to their evolution being held back. They would watch fake ideological stories on a screen. They would march in circles demanding change. They would listen to antagonist justify their oppression? Would parents really spoil their kids with generic mass-produced items instead of fighting for their God-given freedom to evolve?

We were fighting our evolution instead of our natural enemy.

Our true enemy is Entropy, the continual change of our environment through ice storms, hurricanes, plagues, solar radiation, and everything else making Life on Earth a work in progress. For billions of years every organism on Earth has evolved. Did humanity think we mustn't be vigiliant?

Of course we must! 

Yet, we are not biological creatures. We evolve with technology. After Charles Darwin taught us evolution, it was the antagonists in their fake stories of racism, sexism, and elitism that proved our survival on this Lifeboat of Earth is not based on our biology. We outrace Entropy through the free and wide-spread creation, adoption, and replacement of technologies.

Before we protected our technological evolution as a sacred right, it's no wonder we suffered as much as we used to. Horrible events like civil wars, depressions, and revolutions were common! All were violent jumps of our evolution caused because Life's demand of continual problem-solving was held back every day in millions of ways.

It's hard to believe mothers would let their kids suffer so much pain in exchange for a car, McMansion, or fake titles like Prince and Executive. If the majestic kodiak bear or bald eagle makes their own homes with modesty, how are my kids made better through luxurious things, if those same things will one day be their undoing? 

I'd rather my kids brag about their planet then than their house.

But that wasn't always the case. We know now delaying evolution is as immoral as theft. We today purge our souls of antagonism whenever it comes up in our community, so we never go back. Like how Galileo taught science over mythology, Jefferson freedom over servitude, Darwin evolution over creationism, this book teaches us techvolution over ideology.

I read this book to understand the past so we may never relive it. I must because other brave mothers changed their future. I thank all those mothers dearly. Now my kids will never fight ideological wars or suffer economic depressions.

Instead, they can work hard to evolve humanity's glorious future among the stars.

A happy loving mother
