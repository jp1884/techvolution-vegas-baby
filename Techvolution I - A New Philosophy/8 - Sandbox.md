## Foreword

My oldest child enlisted in a beginner Spanish class. It wasn't long before the teacher suspected Spanish was his mother tongue. To test him, she briefly showed him words of colors typed in a different color. So "blue" was typed in red ink, for example. My son then had to say the color each word was written in. 

Here's an example:

<button class="t-btn" v-if="!languageBlank" @click="startTestBlank()">Blank</button>
<button class="t-btn-disabled" v-if="languageBlank" disabled>...</button>
<button class="t-btn" v-if="!languageEnglish" @click="startTestEnglish()">English</button> 
<button class="t-btn-disabled" v-if="languageEnglish" disabled>...</button>

<div class="language-test">
  <p v-if="languageBlank" id="wordBlank"></p>
  <p v-if="languageEnglish" id="wordEnglish"></p>
</div>
  
It's an easy test if you don't know the language, but near impossible if you do. Even if you're pretending ignorance, your mind reads the word before seeing the color. My kid was soon found out and took the advanced class. I laughed when he told me the story. I advised him to take a lesson from it.

The lesson is you should never devolve; it's a mindset only for the doomed.

That's the reason I still read this book today in 2083. I never want to go back.

I sometimes forget that _Techvolution_ was as transformative as it was.

Was humanity ever so hamstrung? 

Did ideology control economics the same way religion once did politics? Were people loyal to their personalities instead of their achievements? Could someone interfere with a worker's evolution and call themselves a boss; and not an antagonist who never faced a worker's or customer's review? Why were there so many currencies instead of using Nature's currency? Would teachers demand their students not use the latest technology because those teachers wanted safe jobs for life based on ancient technology? Would a person own a tool and not be allowed to repair it?

Understanding how regular people responded to their evolution being held back is even more confusing. They would watch ideological stories on a screen and call that politics. They would march in circles expecting their lives to improve. Did parents really raise their kids in suburban isolation while showering them with generic mass-produced items instead of instilling a God-given requirement to evolve better solutions to their specific life?

The hard truth is yes; we used to live this way. I must remember that. It's easy to forget humanity once fought our evolution instead of our natural enemy.

Our true enemy is Entropy, the catchall term for the continuous change of our environment through ice storms, hurricanes, solar radiation, and everything else, making Life on Earth a precious work in progress. For billions of years, every organism has evolved to stay ahead of the nasty, brutish, and short-life Entropy can cause. Did humanity think we mustn't also be vigilant?

Of course we must! Like any animal, Entropy is always on our tail; we feel pain as a warning to change our ways to stay ahead of its wrath.

Yet, we are not biological creatures. The caveman didn't start fire with lasers from his eyes, and explorers didn't map the world by flying across oceans because we are not superheroes. Our race, sex, and genetics do not keep us warm or grow our food. We, humans, are biological vessels for technological evolution.

We outrace Entropy by learning the language of our fate; the free and widespread creation, adoption, and replacement of technologies. Our technological evolution has the same requirements as normal evolution powering everything from slime molds to blue whales. We need unfettered innovation to create a variety of new technological adaptions. Whichever adaptions most efficiently harness available resources, capture a niche, and are rewarded with a job in Life's holy war against Entropy.

That's why our most important identity is the tools we use. Our tools, not our biology, enable us to find a niche and earn a living. And, unlike biological animals, we can pick up and drop tools to become new and improved technological species throughout our lifetime. Inventors are thus our heroes, the people who help our technological evolution are our allies, and those who oppose us are our antagonists.

Seeing ourselves as biological beings had us chasing shadows. When we primarily identified with race, gender, or genetics, it allowed those with control over an important technology, from princes to supervisors, to listen to their baser instincts and become gatekeepers if they so desired. These people asked, "Why rerun the race of technological evolution when a story puts me on top?"

Until this book, we didn't realize racism, sexism, and elitism are each shadows of antagonism. We'd attack one head of the hydra but never the root cause, so it was simple for antagonists to create yet another story to justify their control over technology.

We were born free, but everywhere our technological evolution was chained.

Yet, even with all their masterful storytelling, antagonists always failed. They proved human survival on this lifeboat called Earth is not based on our biology. Anyone who ever preached biological superiority fell in the face of technological progress.

Sadly, that progress wasn't perfect. It was so sporadic and uncertain that Entropy often caught up with civilization and inflicted painful attacks called layoffs, unemployment, homelessness, recessions, civil wars, depressions, and revolutions. The real cause in these human affairs was not failed government policy or unfair history; it was about thwarted evolution, i.e., the stream of adaptions needed to outrun Entropy were stalled because people wouldn't, or couldn't, adopt them.

Ironically, the people who benefitted most from keeping Entropy away would invite it back by antagonizing evolution. Antagonists merely set the stage for society's suffering and their downfall. Evolution's selection of the best adaptions requires a daily and hour scrutinizing, throughout the world, of every adaption, even the slightest. 

That's why today, we protect every individual's technological evolution as a sacred right and teach it as an absolute obligation.

Harnessing technological evolution seems simple to us now, but it took a big change to get here. Galileo taught us science over mythology, Jefferson freedom over servitude, and Darwin evolution over creationism; this book teaches us techvolution over ideology. The pathway to healthy economics is democratized technological solutions that let everyone find their niche. We judge our success by measuring the health of our technological ecosystem's checks and balances as biologists do with the natural world. Politics is good when it ensures everyone can freely access the tools they need or want to experiment with.

Because of techvolution, today, we no longer have ideologies that encourage extremes and excess. Instead, we practice techvolution that promotes moderation and problem-solving. 

This enlightenment brought tremendous progress, yet human Nature is not perfect. We still have many problems today. But at least we know antagonism comes too naturally to us when we have authority over others, from teachers to coaches, supervisors to executives, and so it must be purged in ourselves and our community whenever it appears. Like knowing a language, once you understand a way of thinking, you can't help but see the world differently. Better tools are the best weapon against Entropy, but gatekeeping a technology is a false god that, instead of securing one's future, destroys the checks and balances required inside ecosystems and thus leads to everyone's inevitable destruction.

Now I must thank those who took the first leap. It was many brave parents decades ago who unplugged from ideology and ventured into the frontier to start a new society. Because of them, we now study, understand, and promote our technological evolution's new modes and orders. As a result, today's parents know every kid has an important goal to achieve and a fun story to live because, like in the natural world, there's always a niche to fill inside an evolving ecosystem. 

Our kids don't die in ideological wars, suffer economic depressions, and rarely struggle with psychological torments.

Instead, they are busy working hard with other frontline workers under minimal, open, and accountable leadership, using any tool they need. Nature's currency interconnects them inside a technological ecosystem adopting new adaptions so quickly that it's edging us closer to perpetual profit while evolving Life closer to our glorious future among the stars.

Along with their teachers and leaders, I helped my kids find their technological niche. And now I get to watch them achieve their very best. I advise them to re-read this book often to be sure their kids will continue evolving mankind to our highest potential.

A happy and loving mother

P.S.
I shudder to think of our fate had we continued to interpret our reality using ideologies that blamed each other for their shared ineffectiveness to defeat Entropy and give people a happy life.
