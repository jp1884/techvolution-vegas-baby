## Politics

If a genie granted me three wishes, I'd wish you are as sick of politics as I am. That you're proudly middle-class. And you think our society is full of wasted potential.

Ending hunger, getting rich, and even halting this coronavirus wouldn't cross my mind. It may seem a waste, but it's not. From Cinderella to Braveheart, what hero ever dreamed their problems away?

The truth is the middle class needs to act. Main Street has massive untapped political power, and the sooner we realize it, the sooner can get happy again.

Symptons of our inaction are everywhere: rising debt, shaky employment, expensive health-care. Not too long ago, our political culture would solve problems like this. Not anymore. "Politics" is now ideologically obessesed reporters, columnists, and academics finding new ways to sing to their choirs.

In _Techvolution_ we'll uncover why Left/Right politics is so extreme. But even better, we'll rework what's ethical in today's political world. By unmasking political Nature, we'll understand why we must empower welders, nurses, everyone on the frontline, with new amazing new digital technology. Politics is only good when it advances our technological evolution.

And we entered the completely new and wondrous Internet Age in 1970. Left/Right are as obsolete as the horse and carriage. To prosper again, we need a new Internet Age philosophy.

Here it is. And I wish it clicks with people like you.
