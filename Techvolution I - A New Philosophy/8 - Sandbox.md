Even before this pandemic we had many problems: rising debt, growing bureaucracies, expensive healthcare. Not too long ago, we could depend on our political culture to solve these everyday problems. Not anymore. Today, our politics is ideologically obsessed reporters, columnists, and academics finding new ways to sing to their choirs.

In _Techvolution_ we'll uncover why Left/Right hate each other so much. Even better, we'll learn to disregard both Conservatives and Progressivess. The middle-class problems aren't solved by echo chambers. We need better technology, apps, electronics to live happier lives.

Joyfully, Main Street can empower itself with to new heights because in 1970 we entered the Internet Age and unlocked truly amazing technology. Left/Right aren't evil, they're both from the Industrial Age, and both will be as obsolete as the horse and carriage; once we adopt a new Internet Age philosophy.

Here it is. And I wish it clicks with powerful people like you.
