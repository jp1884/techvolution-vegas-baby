## Foreword

My oldest child enlisted in a beginner Spanish class. It wasn't long before the teacher suspected Spanish was his mother tongue. To test him, she briefly showed him words of colors typed in a different color. So "blue" was typed in red ink, for example. My son then had to say the color each word was written in. 

Here's an example:

<button class="t-btn" v-if="!languageBlank" @click="startTestBlank()">Blank</button>
<button class="t-btn-disabled" v-if="languageBlank" disabled>...</button>
<button class="t-btn" v-if="!languageEnglish" @click="startTestEnglish()">English</button> 
<button class="t-btn-disabled" v-if="languageEnglish" disabled>...</button>

<div class="language-test">
  <p v-if="languageBlank" id="wordBlank"></p>
  <p v-if="languageEnglish" id="wordEnglish"></p>
</div>
  
It's an easy test if you don't know the language, but near impossible if you do. Even if you're pretending ignorance, your mind reads the word before seeing the color. My kid was soon found out and took the advanced class. I laughed when he told me the story. I advised him to take a lesson from it.

The lesson is you should never devolve, it's a mindset only for the doomed.

That's the reason I still read this book today in 2083. I never want to go back.

I sometimes forget that _Techvolution_ was as transformative as it was.

Was humanity ever so hamstrung? 

Did ideology control economics the same way religion once did politics? Were people loyal to their personalities instead of their achievements? Could someone interfere with a worker's evolution and call themselves a boss; and not an antagonist who never faced a customer's review? Why were there so many currencies instead of using Nature's currency? Would teachers demand their students not use the latest technology because those teachers wanted safe jobs for life based on ancient technology? Would a person own a tool and not be allowed to repair it?

Understanding how regular people responded to their evolution being held back is even more confusing. They would watch ideological stories on a screen and call that politics. They would march in circles expecting their lives to improve. Did parents really raise their kids in suburban isolation while showering them with generic mass-produced items instead of instilling a God-given requirement to evolve better solutions to their specific life?

The hard truth is yes, we used to live this way. I must remember that. It's easy to forget humanity once fought our evolution instead of our natural enemy.

Our true enemy is Entropy, the catchall term for the continuous change of our environment through ice storms, hurricanes, solar radiation, and everything else, making Life on Earth a precious work in progress. For billions of years, every organism has evolved new adaptions to stay ahead of the nasty, brutish, and short-life Entropy can cause. Did humanity think we mustn't also be vigilant?

Of course we must! Whenever we feel pain, it's proof Entropy is always on our tail.

Yet, we are not biological creatures. Did the caveman start a fire with lasers from his eyes? Did explorers map the world by flying across oceans? No, we are not superheroes. Our race, sex, and genetics do not keep us warm or grow our food. We are all biological vessels for technological evolution.

We outrace Entropy by learning the language of our fate; the free and widespread creation, adoption, and replacement of technologies. Our technological evolution has the exact requirements of normal evolution. We need unfettered innovation to create a variety of new technological adaptions. Whichever adaptions most efficiently harness available resources, capture a niche, and are rewarded with a job in Life's holy war against Entropy.

That's why our most important identity is the tools we use. Our tools, not our biology, enable us to find a niche and earn a living. But unlike biological animals, we can pick-up and drop tools to become new and improved technological species at will. Innovators are thus our heroes, the people who help our technological evolution are our allies, and those who oppose us are our antagonists.

Seeing ourselves as biological beings had us chasing shadows. When we primarily identified with race, gender, or genetics, it allowed technological powerbrokers to become unchallenged gatekeepers who skipped the race of evolution because they convinced people to give them resources for free. Distracted by the darkness, we let antagonists justify their advantage by spinning ideological stories about their supposed racial, gender, education, or noble superiority.

We were born free, but everywhere our technological evolution was chained.

Yet, even with all their talented storytelling, antagonists always failed. They proved human survival on this lifeboat called Earth is not based on our biology. Anyone who ever preached biological superiority fell in the face of technological progress.

That progress was so sporadic and uncertain it allowed Entropy to often catch up. The pain of its attacks was called recessions, civil wars, depressions, and revolutions. The real cause in these human affairs was never about culture, policy, or history; it was the about thwarted evolution; i.e. the stream of adaptions needed to outrun Entropy were stalled because people wouldn't, or couldn't, adopt them.

Ironically, the people who benefitted most from keeping Entropy away would invite it back by antagonizing evolution. Antagonists merely set the stage for society's suffering and their downfall. Natural selection requires a daily and hour scrutinizing, throughout the world, of every adaption, even the slightest. 

That's why today, we protect every individual's technological evolution as a sacred right and teach it as an absolute obligation.

Harnessing technological evolution seems simple to us now, but it took a big change to get here. Galileo taught us science over mythology, Jefferson freedom over servitude, and Darwin evolution over creationism; this book teaches us techvolution over ideology. Its lessons grant us the pathway to healthy politics and economics; democratized technological solutions that let everyone find their niche. We now judge our politics and economics by measuring the health of our technological ecosystem's checks and balances as biologists do with the natural world.

Because of techvolution, today, we no longer have ideologies that encourage extremes and excess. Instead, we practice techvolution that promotes moderation and problem-solving. 

This change brought tremendous progress, yet human nature is not perfect. We still have many problems today. But at least we know antagonism in all its forms-racism, sexism, elitism-must be purged in ourselves and our community whenever it appears. Like knowing a language, once you understand a way of thinking, you automatically see the world differently. Using better tools are the best weapon against Entropy, but gatekeeping a technology is a false god that, instead of being the source of ever-lasting security people hope for, destroys the checks and balances required inside ecosystems, and thus leads to everyone's inevitable destruction.

Now I must thank those who took the first leap. It was many brave parents decades ago who unplugged from ideology and ventured into the frontier to start a new society. Because of them, we study, understand, and promote our technological evolution's new modes and orders. As a result, today's parents know every kid has an important goal to achieve and a fun story to live because, like in the natural world, there's always a niche to fill inside our ever-evolving ecosystem. 

Now, our kids don't die in ideological wars, suffer economic depressions, and only rarely struggle with psychological torments.

Instead, they are busy working hard with other frontline workers under minimal, open, and accountable leadership, using any tool they need. They are interconnected by Nature's currency inside a technological ecosystem adopting new adaptions so quickly its edging us closer to perpetual profit while evolving Life closer to our glorious future among the stars.

Along with their teachers and leaders, I helped my kids find a technological niche. And now I get to watch them achieve their very best. I advise them to re-read this book often to be sure their kids will continue evolving mankind to our highest potential.

A happy and loving mother

P.S.
I shudder to think of our fate had we continued to interpret our reality using ideologies that blamed each other for their shared ineffectiveness to defeat Entropy and give people a happy life.
