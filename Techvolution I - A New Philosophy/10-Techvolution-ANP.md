# Techvolution: A New Philosophy For Our Modern World

## Rear Page Summary

Conservatives are making the middle class great again. Across the world these red-blooded patriots are giving regular people better jobs and honest government. Don't be a socialist; join them and fight for your liberty!

No, wait. The Progressives are the good guys fighting for us all. Their ideology is the one saving us from climate change, racism, sexism, elitism, chauvinism while making sure everyone gets their fair share. Fight fascism; fight for social progress!

Our politics is filled with black-and-white messages like these because left-wing and right-wing ideologues keep spreading their single-minded stories throughout society. On cable news, social media, dinner tables around America, It's winner takes all, no moderation or compromise is allowed.

Many people are sick of their toxicity.

Here's a new philosophy called Techvolution—it's custom-designed to calm our politics via Mixed-Ideological Politics and supercharge or innovation and job market with Bumblebee Economics.

Let's get started.

## Inner Flap

In an age of growing political polarization and technological disruption, "Techvolution" offers a new framework for understanding and navigating the challenges of our time.

This book argues that we must move beyond the outdated left-right ideologies that have long dominated our politics and economics. Instead, in the age of ever-expanding technology, we must embrace our identity as a "technological species" - one whose evolution is driven more by the tools and innovations we create more than any of our biological traits or chosen identities.

Techvolution presents a synthesis of conservative and progressive values, blending the efficiency-focused principles of capitalism with the equity-minded goals of social democracy. Through its core tenets of "Mixed-Ideological Politics" and "Bumblebee Economics," this philosophy shows how we can harness the power of technology to generate and distribute wealth in a more efficient yet sustainable way.

Drawing insights from evolutionary biology, pollitical philsophy, and the history of technological progress, Techvolution offers a fresh perspective on perennial questions of human development. How can we structure our institutions and incentives to foster continuous innovation? What is the role of government in shaping technological change? And how can individuals find meaningful niches within an ever-evolving technological ecosystem?

Rather than get caught up in the zero-sum battles of left vs. right, Techvolution empowers readers to become active agents of their own technological evolution. By embracing a mindset of collaborative problem-solving and open-source innovation, we can build a future of greater prosperity, resilience, and freedom for all.

Thought-provoking and pragmatic, Techvolution provides an essential roadmap for navigating the complexities of the 21st century. It is a must-read for anyone seeking to transcend the ideological divides of our time and unlock the full potential of human and technological co-evolution.

## Endorsements/Quotes

"I know oppression is wrong. I marched, voted, and protested for social justice. I'm also tired of always fighting. I want to find common ground. I want to help my grandkids who keep telling me the rising cost of living is their main problem."
_A Ethically-minded American resident_

"American values were once celebrated around the world. But America is not the beacon on the hill she once was. We were fighting ourselves to death. Techvolution helped me understand embracing change means we can make the future one of liberty and individual empowerment again."
_A Proud American_

"Global instability, resource wars, societal infighting? I told myself these were a 'you' problem, not a 'me' problem. I planned to ride out whatever problems humanity suffered inside the comfort of my home. The truth is, I was just so turned off by politics. Techvolution showed me how to find compromise by working on economic development that generated and distributed wealth at the same time."
_A former non-voting American_

"I need my employees to be engaged. I need to be inclusive. I need to be profitable. I need to be innovative. I felt like I was flying blind until Techvolution explained where we are in human evolution. Now I know how to direct my projects, communicate with the people, and make my goals happen."
Regional Director, Acme Corp. 

"I love technology. Submitting a pull request on a repo makes me smile. But the open-source ecosystem was too often isolated, underfunded, and lacked direction. Techvolution gave us the plot we needed. Now we install a brick of the Internet Age with every PR we make."
An Open-Source contributor

"Gone are the days of feeling helpless in the face of social injustice, government overreach, and the rising cost of living. Techvolution equipped me with an evolutionary framework to navigate our technology-driven world."
_An American who wants to pay their bills_

## Preface

Talk to any political junkie, no matter when, and they'll say there's a big election coming up. They'll tell you, "if the Right-wing triumphs, infrastructure, healthcare, everything will go to shit!"

If you buy it—and most of us have at some point—you glue yourself to Left-wing blogs, radio, and TV. As you fill-up on Leftist philosophy, you'll filter human history as a never ending story of social oppression liberated by strong government action. With every additional minute you watch the news, you'll walk towards extremism and begin to see any opposition to Leftist demands as _fascist_ Conservatives opposing social justice for their selfish greed.

Or, if the other side sucked you in first, you start spotting _communist_ Progressives and their unholy socialist agenda instead. Most people are helpless during this drive towards extremism for good reason: devouted ideologues tell a great story.

Broadly speaking in America today, Republicans are right-wing because they align with Conservatism and Capitalism, while the Democrats are left-wing because they embrace Progressivism and Socialism. All of these philosophies were created centuries ago by people desperate to industrialize their agrarian societies. Poor, hungry, and cold people raced to invent steam power, machine tools, and other innovations to mass-produce roads, radios, factories, hospitals, and schools. American society tried both rightist ideas, like Roosevelt's trustbusting monopolies, and leftist ideas, like the other Roosevelt's fight against economic depressions via a social safety net.

In the end, America won the Industrial Age race, turning itself from a muddy backwater in 1776 into the world's economic powerhouse in 1960.

Today's ideologues portray their side as righteous protectors of America's post-industrial pension plans, medical systems, and wealth, with the "other" being a constant threat. Both sides ignore that industrialization was a shared story many pages long, and each ideology had successes and failures. But since they have few new ideas, today's Left and Right must take all the credit for America's industrialization to keep themselves relevant.

With their industrialization ideologies aging, ideologues resort to more marketing. Which is why they tell such good stories on the news, streams, and blogs. Once their captivating tales fill your mind, the nuance and complexity of history fade in favour of the excitement of cheering for "the good guys."

Techvolution can't compete with this chorus of entertainment. I don't want to. Anyone with easy answers to our problems is lying to you. No one has ever built a society facing today's challenges using today's Internet Age technology. This is the first time Earth has 7+ billion people, advanced robotics, electric cars, AI, nuclear weapons. How could anyone have all the solutions?

And here's the face-palm movement: today's ideologies were created by people very out of the loop. Their founding thinkers, Adam Smith, Karl Marx, Edmund Burke, and John Stuart Mill, never used a toilet, never sat in a car, never disinfected a wound. Each thinker has lessons to teach of course, but we should build upon them instead of clinging to them as their devout followers today do, like dinosaurs trying to survive after the world has moved on, believing in outdated worldviews ill-suited for the modern era.

So no, Techvolution avoids easy answers because there are none for anyone who wants to offer practical solutions to real-life problems. That's why instead of repeating Left-Right industrialization politics, metrics, and policies, Techvolution measures its success on how prosperous the middle-class is. The rate of mortage payoff. The cost of insurance. Time spent in traffic. We can improve real-life metrics when our society turns from extremism and instead learns the fundamental laws governing life's evolution on Earth. Since we evolve with technology, so we must learn to fully harness technological evolution; hence the new word "Techvolution."

This new philsophy's two tenants are MIP and BBE. MIP is the recognition that as technological beings someone's politics should promote the tools they use to make a living. The Industrial Age had relatively powerful but still primitive technology. Most production lines and offices needed humans to power the production. It took years to master using a typewriter or welding machine. People often had jobs for life out of necessity as learning a new trade was near impossible. Thus people had fixed ideology's. Workers voted for more of a share, while owners voted for their own interests.

Modern tools are increasingly cheap, easy to learn, and powerful. It's easier for a individual person to mix-and-match modern tools to the needs of their unique life. MIP tells people to go for it. Learn and use whatever tools will improve your bottom line. Out of neccesity then, your politics should also be mixed as you might be a worker, and an owner, several times in your life, perhaps even at the same time.

BBE is the technological specifications needed to be sure that individual tools should be able to work together with minimal, if any, middleman. Think about it, creatures in nature as different as a squriell, acorn, and bobcat can all work together in the same ecosystem, even though there's no one to order them around.

This amazing world of MIP and BBE is here in writing, but not out in the world yet. That's why this philosophy empowers you to ask better questions so you can discover lasting solutions to the problems of your unique life. Techvolution can't be entertainment because it stops you being a spectator, and turns you into an active agent who lowers the cost of living by creating an economy that generates and distributes wealth for everyone who works for it.

While this book won't be entertaining as Left vs Right broadcasts, I'll do my best to make this new philosophy fun and inspiring. Because the future should be.

## Foreword

My oldest child enrolled in a beginner Spanish class. It wasn't long before the teacher suspected (correctly) that Spanish was his mother tongue. To test him, Ms. Milgram showed words of colors typed in a different color, so "red" was shown in blue ink, for example. With only a half-second to see each slide, my son had to say the color each word was written in.

<LanguageTest />

It's nearly impossible to cheat the test. Even if you're pretending ignorance, your mind reads the word "red" before seeing it's typed in blue. My kid was soon found out and took the advanced Spanish class. I laughed when he told me the story. I advised him to take a lesson from it.

No lifeform can ever stop evolving; it's a mindset only for the doomed.

That's the reason I still read this book today in 2083. I never want to go back.

I sometimes forget _Techvolution_ was as transformative as it was.

Was humanity ever so hamstrung?

Did ideology control economics the same way religion once did politics? Were people loyal to their personalities instead of their achievements? Why did the world's regions have stark inequalities? Why were there so many currencies instead of using God's currency? Would teachers demand that their students not use the latest technology because teachers wanted safe jobs for life teaching ancient technology?

What's even more confusing is trying to understand how regular people responded to their evolution being held back. They would watch ideological stories on a screen and call that politics. They would have one career for life and, therefore, one ideology for life, regardless of changes in technology, demographics, and environment. How could parents raise their kids in suburban isolation while showering them with generic mass-produced items instead of instilling a God-given requirement for their children to use their unique gifts, physique, and passions to evolve solutions to their problems?

The hard truth is yes, we used to live this way. I must remember that. It's easy to forget that humanity once fought our evolution instead of our natural enemy.

Our true enemy is Entropy, the catchall term for the continuous change of our environment through ice storms, hurricanes, solar radiation, and everything else making Life on Earth a constant work in progress. For billions of years, every organism has rushed to stay ahead of the nasty, brutish, and short-life Entropy can cause. Did humanity think we must not be vigilant?

Of course we must! Like any animal, Entropy is always on our tail. We feel the agony of pain as a blessed warning to avoid chutes and cherish ladders while living on the gameboard of life; only by reducing pain can we stay ahead of Entropy's wrath.

Yet, we are not solely biological creatures. Did the caveman start a fire with lasers from his eyes? Did explorers map the world by flying across oceans? No, we are not superheroes. Our race, sex, and genetics do not keep us warm or grow our food.

So what does it mean to be human in the age of advancing technology? We are increasingly not just biological beings, but vessels for technological evolution - complex systems that can adapt, learn, and grow in ways that biology alone can't. And it's fostering our diversity of sizes, personalities, and abilities that allows us to operate entire technological ecosystems.

We outrace Entropy by learning the language of our fate: the free and widespread creation, adoption, and replacement of technologies on the technological tree of life. Technological evolution has the exact requirements as the evolution powering everything from slime molds to blue whales. We need unfettered innovation to create a variety of new technological adaptions. Whichever adaptions most efficiently harness resources captures a niche and is rewarded with a job in life's holy war against Entropy.

That's why our most important identity is the tools we use. Our tools, not our biology, enable us to find a niche and earn a living. Importantly, unlike biological animals, we can replace our tools and become new and improved technological species throughout our lifetime. Inventors are thus our heroes, the people who help our technological evolution are our allies, and those who oppose our technological self-improvement are our, and evolution's, antagonists.

Seeing ourselves as biological beings had us chasing shadows.

When we primarily identified with race, gender, or ethnicity, it allowed those with control over an important technology, from princes to supervisors, to become gatekeepers and stop our evolution. Even worse was how believing in biological identities gave antagonists the ammunition they needed to spin up ideological stories that (supposedly) justified why their racial, gender, or noble "superiority" put them above participating in the evolutionary race as equals.

When humanity fought against these fictions, another would inevitably pop up. Like a hydra, racism, sexism, and elitism could be re-born because biological identities were masks of identify distracting humanity from the technological antagonism holding them back.

We were born free, but everywhere, our technological self-evolution was chained.

Despite their talented storytelling, antagonists always failed. They proved human survival on this lifeboat called Earth is not based on our biology. Any group who ever claimed biological superiority fell in the face of technological inclusion and innovation.

That progress wasn't perfect. Entropy often caught up with us because antagonism made our evolution sporadic. The pain of its attacks was called layoffs, unemployment, homelessness, recessions, civil wars, depressions, and revolutions. So what was really behind our struggles? Was it bad government policies or unfair circumstances? Nope. It was thwarted evolution, i.e., we didn't, or were prevented, from adopting innovations fast enough to outrun Entropy.

Nature made us pay for our sins. Every biology student knows evolution's selection of the best adaptions requires a daily and hour scrutinizing, throughout the world, of every adaption, even the slightest. That's why today, we protect every individual's technological evolution as a sacred right and teach it as an absolute obligation.

Harnessing technological evolution seems simple to us today, but getting here took a big change. Galileo taught us science over mythology, Jefferson freedom over servitude, Darwin evolution over creationism; this book teaches us Techvolution over ideology. With it, we learned the pathway to healthy economics is Bumblebee economics via democratized, interoperable, and open-source technological products that let everyone find their niche. We judge our economic success by measuring the health of our technological ecosystem's checks and balances as biologists do with the natural world. Perhaps most important, everyone needs a mixture of tools to solve their problems, and thus everyone needs a healthy mixture of political beliefs to protect and promote their tools.

Techvolution transformed the era of mass production into the era of mass collaboration. This change finally unlocked the super-productivity of Internet Age technology like 3D printers, crypto-currency, augmented reality, and artificial intelligence.

I am not naive. Human Nature will never be perfect. We still have many problems today. But now we know gatekeeping by way of bullying, lawsuits, and violence comes too naturally when we have authority over others, from teachers to coaches, executives to princes. To fight against our darker Nature by purging the antagonism via the continued universal experience of real-life troubles and the reliance on others to solve our pains.

Knowing Techvolution is like learning a language. Once you understand this way of thinking, you automatically realize creating and distributing better tools is what truly secures everyone's freedom and prosperity. This new philosophy also teaches us that gatekeeping technology is a false god that, instead of securing one's future, destroys the checks and balances required inside ecosystems. Thus antagonism is a tragic tale that leads to its own inevitable destruction.

Now, I must thank those who took the first leap. Decades ago, many brave parents unplugged themselves from fixed-ideological politics and their respective identities and ventured into the frontier to start a new society. Because of them, we study, understand, and promote our technological evolution's new modes and orders. As a result, today's parents know every kid has an important goal to achieve and a fun story to live because, like in the natural world, there's always a niche to fill inside our ever-evolving technological ecosystem that's using Nature's currency to harness energy more efficiently every day. 

Now, all the world's regions sustain happy human life. Like the relgious wars that once plague humanity, our kids no longer die in ideological wars. Economic depressions are distant a memory. And psychological torments rarely afflict our children.

Instead, they receive the customized education and tools they need to roll their own dice on the gameboard of life. They work with other frontline workers under minimal, open, and accountable leadership, using any tool they need. Nature's currency interconnects them inside a technological ecosystem filled with open-source and interoperable tools that select new adaptations so quickly it's edging us closer to perpetual profit while evolving life closer to our glorious future among the stars.

Along with their teachers and leaders, I helped my kids find their technological niche. And now I get to watch them achieve their very best. I advise them to re-read this book often to be sure their kids will continue evolving mankind to our highest potential.

A happy and loving mother
circa 2083

P.S.
I shudder to think of our fate if we had continued to interpret our reality using ideologies that blamed each other for their shared inability to drop old ways of living and work hard to give our kids a happy life.

- We co-evolve with technology, the same way bees and flowers do

## Chapter 1

Learning evolution--actually Techvolution--will be a process. Not only because of the things to learn, but for the knowledge you must unlearn -like the identities the Left and Right give themselves.

One way for me to tip your interest towards an education in Techvolution is asking, do you think you're going to make it?

Of course I don't mean you and your family are in danger. Unless you live in Ukraine, Russia, Palestine, Israel, Sudan, Taiwain, Korea, Kasmir, Sri Lanka, or any of the other flash points at different levels of illumination. Those troubles won't spread. Once you choose one of the warring Left/Right ideologies, you'll have someone to blame, and ranting, protesting, and rioting against another group of people will keep you safe.

Perhaps I'm being too coy, but blaming someone else is the theme of many Left vs Right TV shows, news feeds, and debtes. And for good reason, blaming someone else for your problems is a good way to hook an audience; fighting fascists and saving America from socialists is an exciting story.

And, American politics could very well get much more dangerous. More civil unrest, more government gridlock, more assassination attempts. Hopefully not, but would anyone be surprised at this point if it did?

These fights getting worse around the world aren't random. They are caused because our way of life that was born in the Industrial Age and spread around the world during globalization, is well past it's life expectancy. The benefits of industrialization are obvious. Going from hand tools, to power tools, artisan-made items to mass-produce products, speeds up the time needed to construct buildings, farm land, print books. 

But today, the automobile that once sped up transportation, is often sitting in bumper to bumper traffic. The tasty fast food that was once an enticing treat, is now daily food causing mass health problems. The suburban house that once held many friends and tupperware parties is increasingly so big and expensive the youth struggle finding a home.

As the once innovation Industrial Age products are aging, the people who use those products are feeling the pains of old-age too. We're behind the evolutionary times; Entropy is catching up to us like it does for any other creature. The simmering conflicts around our planet appear to be over ideology and history, but in reality lifeforms don't have reason to fight if everyone has enough resources to be secured with good shelter, stable food, quality education, hopeful futures. When the salmon are running up Canadian rivers, fierce grizzly bears come together in their dozens and cause each other no harm. Bountiful resources brings peace.

The Industrial Age created a bounty for humanity. The food supply, political stability, individual freedom all grew by leaps and bounds for seveal generations. There's a reason why human popoulation exploded 1150% from 1900 to 2000, and why historians call the period after World War II "the long peace".

Digital technology was supposed to make the long peace last forever. In 1969 several American universities invented the ARPAnet. This tiny network was the first internet, where the backbone technology called TCP/IP was invented. The same year an inventor name Douglas Engelbart put on his "Mother of All Demos" where he showed a world used to typewriters and telegraphs the first personal computer. Among the attendees that fateful demonstration was the people who soon make the Apple Macintosh computer.

You might be thinking, why does this guy keep saying we need to live in the Internet Age. We are, aren't we? I'm holding an iPhone in my hand, and doesn't the "i" stand for internet.

Being in an Age doesn't mean being from the Age. Holding a iron hammer doesn't mean your from the Iron Age. For one, you likely have no idea how to forge anything out of iron. Most importantly though, you don't need the hammer to make a living. You could use a power tool, as most people would today, instead of hammering nails all day.

Likewise, most everyone can not use modern technology. Can you program an app? Understand how internet packets work? Build your own computer? And moreover, the modern technology you do use, is likely only a consumer a product. A toy to spend time with and not depend on. The default choice for most of our institutions is still a telephone number, not a WhatsApp chat. Politicians debate on broadcast television, with its limited time slots and commercial breaks, instead of talking on YouTube for as long as they need to (Abe Lincoln debated for three hours in his 1859 debates. No breaks.). Industrial Age tools are still the defaut tools most of the time because we are still in that age.

Yet, the Industrial Age bounty is mostly gone. Here is a list of our problems today. Take your time flipping through them.

*Note, assume there is a list of growing real-world problems, like inflation, debt ratios, health trends.*




Right now, you are standing at the base of the ladder of evolution, and are in the Industrial Age. We're dying. At the top is the Internet Age. It's ready for you to go there and populate it with Mixed-Ideological Politics and Bumble-bee economics. 

But the first steps on the ladder willingness that you must evolve. There's no other way but conflict and extinction.

After you admit that, you can move on up. The first step is learning giving you the respect to explain what this new philosophy knows where to send you.


## Chapter 1 - Techvolution in Your Life




Mix white and black paint, and you'll have a shade of gray. Maybe it'll be lighter or darker gray, but it will always be gray and never white or black. You can't unmix what you've mixed because time only moves forward. As Entropy breaks down, blows up, decomposes the Universe, the arrow of time says things can never go back to the way they were.

That's why Life shudders at stagnation. Life must keep evolving more creatures with more diversity to harvest as many resources as possible. Growing antifragility means Life can better outrun Entropy's ceaseless wrath. 

In 1969 several American universities invented the ARPAnet. This tiny network was the first internet, where the backbone technology called TCP/IP was invented. The same year an inventor name Douglas Engelbart put on his "Mother of All Demos" where he showed a world used to typewriters the first working personal computer. Among the attendees was people who soon worked on and sold millions of Macintosh computers.

We entered the Internet Age in 1969, and we could never go back. Time only goes forward remember. Yet, we didn't evolve along with technology like evolution wanted us to. Thus, Entropy caught up to the Industrial Age and is hurting the clingy countries with more stife, broken politics, and increasing cost of living.

We need to use new MIP and BBE to embrace modern technology and burst out in front of Entropy on the gameboard of Life. But before we do that, you must buy into the Techvolution philosophy: we are biological creatures who must evolve with technology to prosper. While this new philosophy embraces change, it doesn't disregard the past by any means, it builds on it in fact. 

Since we want to stand on the shoulders of giants, you do need to know a little about where today's ideologies come from. Some ideologies say humanity should be poor or whatever. Conservatives and Progressives disagree. Both sides think a "wealth" of products and services is the best way to improve human life. They do disagree on how best to grow economic wealth. Conservaties want to grow wealth efficiently, and Progressives want to distribute wealth fairly. They fight only because they disagree on the best to achieve their common goal of mass-producing a lot of stuff for people to have.

Techvoltion is the synthesis of left-wing and right-wing because it understands how modern technology both creates and distributes wealth at the same time. Linux, MediaWiki, Python are but some examples. The loudness of politics today makes this truth too simple to see; and too inconvenient for many people to acknowledge, so I can't just explain why modern technology can improve our real lives. Sadly, the slick ideological "Left vs. Right" storytelling gives new technology a "side". For example, power wind mills are somehow "Liberal", although wind mills have been around since at least Roman times.

It's hard to talk about technological evolution when people are so dig into their political ideological storytelling. So, instead I'll have to show you Techvolution, MIP, and BBE in action.

Here's a practical way to see why traditional Left Right ideologies are past their evolutionary prime, and why we need Techvolution to harness the power of new technology to solve our problems like government red tape, envionmental damage, and a rising cost of living.

Picture driving your car. You're going to work, to the store, maybe you're on a country road under a blue sky with a slice of peach pie waiting for you at a farm stand so homely you can see the sunset overtop rolling green hills.

Wherever you are, you're driving on the road all peaceful and happy as you should; and then you hit another car head-on.

It's a horrendous crash.

Moments later you awaken in a new reality. You have no clue what happened. Your air bags definitely deployed, you know that because the white bags are all around you. You look around in a haze. Farm fresh peaches are everywhere, what a waste is your first conscious thought. What is your next? What should happen next after a car crash?

Remember this moment. It's not a talking-point on a television show. It's not a zinger in a debate. Every day thousands of people get into a terrible car crash. And it's been happening for over 100 years as Left and Right have been in power inside government and business and still we don't know what to do when it happens to us today.

We'll return to this moment as we learn more about Techvolution and how believing in this new philosophy will improve your everyday life tremendously. It might even safe it too.

## Lifeboat

<!-- Lifeboat Image -->

>The Earth from here is a grand oasis in the big vastness of space.
> Astronaut Jim Lovell, Apollo 8, the first ship to fly around the Moon.

When the first humans went around the Moon, they took a photo. We at home could finally see who we are, tiny things traveling on a rock in the middle of absolutely nothing. The [Earthrise photo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthrise) made people understand how fragile our lives truly are.

Billions of years ago, life started on Earth. Since then erse is governed by the law of evolution. It shouldn't be a surprise that your life, job, civilization's success and failure is also governed by the laws of evolution. Yet, although we understand how the rules of biological evolution apply to creatures, we don't yet understand how the laws of evolution determine our fate.

Learning evolution--actually Techvolution--will be hard. Not only because of the things to learn, but for the knowledge you must unlearn and perhaps most difficult, the things in real life--like the identities the Left and Right like to label each other with so harshly today--you must move past like a distraction it is.

One way for me to tip your interest towards an education in Techvolution is asking, do you think you're going to make it?

Of course I don't mean you and your family are in danger. Unless you live in Ukraine, Russia, Palestine, Israel, Sudan, Taiwain, Korea, Kasmir, Sri Lanka, or any of the other flash points at different levels of illumination. Those troubles won't spread. Once you choose one of the warring Left/Right ideologies, you'll have someone to blame, and ranting, protesting, and rioting against another group of people will keep you safe.

Perhaps I'm being too coy, but blaming someone else is the theme of many Left vs Right TV shows, news feeds, and debtes. And for good reason. The increasingly nasty words in American politics is one of the many examples of the conflicts simmering or raging around the world today.

American politics could very well get much more dangerous. Hopefully not, but would anyone be surprised at this point if it did?

These fights getting worse around the world aren't random. They are caused because our way of life that was born in the Industrial Age and spread around the world during globalization, is well past it's life expectancy. The benefits of industrialization are obvious. Going from hand tools, to power tools speeds up the time needed to construct buildings, farm land, manufacture products. 

But today, the automobile that once sped up transportation, is often sitting in gridlock. The tasty fast food that was once a enticing treat, is now daily food causing mass health problems. The suburban house that once held many friends and tupperware parties is increasingly so big and expensive the youth struggle finding a home.

After decades and centuries on this planet, many of the once innovation Industrial Age products are aging.

Therefore, the people who use those products, are feeling the pains of old-age too. We'll go into this in much detail later, but being behind the evolutionary times means we doing what Nature demands; innovating more efficient ways to live and harvest resources. The simmering conflicts appear to be over ideology and history, but in reality lifeforms don't have reason to fight if everyone has enough resources to feel secure. Grizzly bears come together in their dozens, when salmon are rushing upstream.

The Industrial Age created a bounty for humanity. In comparison to any other era of humanity and you'll notice how the food supply, political stability, individual freedom all grew by leaps and bounds. There's a reason why human popoulation exploded 1150% from 1900 to 2000, and why historians call the period after World War II "the long peace".

Yet, the Industrial Age bounty is mostly gone. Here is a list of our problems today. Take your time flipping through them.

We are not bears fighting because the salmon have gone; after all the salmon come back every year so the bears don't don't get made when the good times have gone. The hard truth for each of us all strong enough to look up into the nothingness around Earth, is using Industrial Age political ideologues and economic systems in the Internet Age, makes us dinosaurs who fight over resources because we are unfit to harvest them in this new land.

Right now, you are standing at the base of the ladder of evolution, and are in the Industrial Age. At the top is the Internet Age. It's ready for you to go there and populate it with Mixed-Ideological Politics and Bumble-bee economics. 

But the first steps on the ladder willingness that you must evolve. There's no other way but conflict and extinction.

After you admit that, you can move on up. The first step is learning givin you the respect to explain what this new philosophy knows where to send you.

- There is plenty of value if the sereneness of Amish living, or the morality of religions. But no matter the words we speak, Entropy's storms, radiation, cold and other perils don't listen to any moral arguments. Every lifeform stays on Earth only because of the resources it can harvest. Some people hate hearing that their hobbies, interests, and personalities don't matter to evolution. I'm sure the Dodo bird had its favorite music, like the dinosaurs loved their children. Neither mattered in the end.

- Evolution on cares about you can do to fend off Entropy's death and destruction only respond to the counter-attacks of clean water, easy education, warm shelters, healthy food, and other things tools give us. If evolution can't understand your interests, personality, etc. it can't select it.

You might be thinking, why does this guy keep staying we need to live in the Internet Age. We are, aren't we? I'm holding an iPhone in my hand, and doesn't the "i" stand for internet.

Being in an Age doesn't mean being from the age. Holding a iron hammer doesn't mean your from the Iron Age. For one, you likely have no idea how to forge one. Most importantly, you don't need the hammer to make a living. You could use a power tool, as most people would, instead of hammering nails all day.

Likewise, a person can not use an iPhone and still make a living today. Try the same thing with paper work. The default choice for most of our institutions is still a telephone number, not a WhatsApp chat. Politicians debate on broadcast television, with its limited time slots and commercial breaks, instead of talking on YouTube for as long as they need to (Lincoln debated for hours in 1859). Industrial Age tools are still the defaut tools most of the time because we are still in that age.

For good reason. The Industrial Age brought us out from poverty. Mud roads became paved ones. Hand-made clothes made way for the sewing machine. These tools changed the world, but were primitive. Which is why factories were the size of cities, computers the size of rooms. With little electricity and robotics meant people needed to power and operatat the first industrial age factories.

Our ancestors worked these jobs, often for their entire lives.

With one job, came one skillset, came one way to earn a living; the political interest of a person was set. As society industrialized, it was the people who owned the factories and the people who operatored the tools and bought the products. Rightists gave preference to the owners whose capital built and sustained factories. Leftists gave perference to the workers and consumers of the products who powered the Industrial Age.

This is the best way for me to explain wgat "mixed ideological politics" is by noting the Industrial Age had fixed-ideological politics. Society is divided into two huge groups that (back then) often admitted they needed each other while still jostling for interests.

We don't have primitive factories, with job security for life. 

The next step on the ladder is learning the rules of evolution.

## Evolution

To make the best possible choice we need to step back and reflect on our situation as much as possible.

The furthest a human has ever looked at Earth is on December 24 1968. Three American astronaughts were going around the moon and saw earth "rise" above the moon's landscape. That's when spaceman Jim Lovell said "I could cover everyone and everything with my thumb". Flying through space in a tiny spacecraft, these astronaughts realized then, what you must today. 

Earth is not a planet.

Planets are balls of rock rotating around a star according to the laws of physics. These laws collect stars and planets together and slowly degrade them into dust. There are many planets in the universe of course.

Earth is among the list of course, but when Life started 3.5 billion years ago, Earth became much more. We don't just have the laws of physics here. Uniquely in the universe, we also have the laws of biology. 

In fact, biology and physics battle each other. Physics likes to degrade moutains, spews storms, crash meteors. Life wants to grow, expand, diversify. Life does this via evolution, and turned this rock wandering around a star into an oasis. Earth isn't just a planet, but a lifeboat.

The laws of evolution are all powerful. Among the nearly infinite forms life can take, evolution decides which lifeforms get to stay and play. Because the laws of physics are unchangeable, the rules of the game are collecting enough resources to survive and procreate. Only the fittest keep their place in the team. Evolution fights physics to turn a rock into an oasis.

We are going to return to politics soon. But first we must complete this quick forary into evolutionary biology. In summary, here are the five rules of evolution.

 - No species survives forever.
 - All lifeforms have a common ancestry.
 - Evolution of new species is gradual.
 - The number of species always multiplies to fill niches.
 - Natural selection determines which individuals lives on.

The vital thing to realize is that humanity is subject to these laws as much as any lifeform before and after us is. We live on the same planet and fight the same laws of physics and biology that force us to eat, stay warm, cool down, and pass on our genes to survive.

And Once you realize, that earth is a lifeboat, and we all are fighting for a spot, the hatred, yelling, and all the shit extremists are doing today makes sense.

The Left and Right are lifeforms fighting for survival. The reason why things are getting so desperate, and why they will keep getting worse before they get better, is because Left and Right are not fighting physics to survive, they are fighting evolution. Because both sides are out of date; dinosaurs trying to survive after earth has change.

Both sides fight, because they don't know how to evolve with it.

Not yet anyway.

There is joke about a physicist trying to explain gravity to a dog. It's not a funny bit so I'll spare you. The punchline is there's no chance the dog will ever get it. Likewise, while we understand the rules of evolution for other creatures, we don't understand the rules of evolution that determine if we'll stay on the lifeboat or die off like the dinosaurs.

To calm our politics I must explain the rules to you. Afterwards, you won't get so emotional over things like Trump, Biden, Democrats or Republications. Instead, you'll pick and choose like evolution does with so much success that one of its lifeform can leave Earth and cover it with his thumb.

Evolution is fighting physics. As physics creates problems for life by making things colder, warmer, wetter, drier and so on, life needs to change the players on the team who can survive and procreate. If physics is the troublemaker in Life's way, evolution is a problem solver finding the creature best suited for the new environment.

This returns us to our nasty politics today. Here are the problems we have. Take your time and look through this list.

FLIPPER RATES UP

These are the problems drawing people to the fire of left vs right politics. Who is to blame for it? Who should pay for it? Bills are billing up. Credit is running out. Darn it, who is paying for all this! Life doesn't have debates and take a vote. If it did, the dinosaurs could have voted themselves to stay alive forever.

Evolution is a open race to solve problems. Whoever collects enough energy to procreate, wins. And you'll notice something about our problems. They started in 1969, and have gotten worse ever since. Take a second look at the problems above and you'll see the trend.

You already know why. At least, you know what evolution does when it encounters problems. All lifeforms must harvest energy. When we don't evolution finds someone else better adapted to survive on the lifeboat. So what changed in 1969?

The laws of physics never stop. There's no running away from gravity, entropy, radiation. These, and many other, things control what happens on Earth. If the evolution is the game of life, the laws of physics controls the gameboard.

Earth's many changes are divided into geological ages. The Jurassic and so on.

FLIPPER SPIRAL

You'll notice that the dinosaurs 

 - No technology survives forever.
 - All technology has a common ancestry.
 - Evolution of new tools is gradual.
 - The number of tools continually diversifies to fill niches.
 - Natural selection determines which individual tools/users live on.
