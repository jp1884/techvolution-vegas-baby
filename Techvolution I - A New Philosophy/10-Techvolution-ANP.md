## Dedication

_This book is for the open-source community — for the collaboration mindset you handed down to me while updating Wikipedia, writing free software, and answering endless questions on StackOverflow. You showed a political student what the future could be as you became the protagonists of the Internet Age. Still, I hope this book inspires you to (no offense) stop making JavaScript frameworks and coding unused side projects because you must create the Internet Age economy, build-step by build-step, posthaste._

_This book is especially dedicated to the extras on Main Street. When it’s time for you to act, I pray you decide to play the game of evolution and reach for the future that the open-source heroes have built for you._

## Quote

"_We are really the revolutionaries in the world today—not the kids with long hair and beards who were wrecking the schools a few years ago._"

Dr. Gordon Moore, author of Moore's Law, 1973.


## Preface

On September 29th 2014 Dr. Johnson made a prediction. He said that in seven years, three months, two days, at 10:11 AM EST, star number 9338 would explode.

Dr. Johnson was a newly minted astrophysicist. Giving a prediction seven years in advance, about an event that was two billion light years away was quite bold. Some people have difficulty knowing their house value next year, and she was predicting an event so far away in time and distance it defies human imagination. Happily, Dr. Johnson was taken seriously and the scientific community aimed their telescope and captured what came could be called "God's Clapping" photograph.

It's quite the image if you feel like looking it up. If you did, it would probably be the first time you would see the photograph because it didn't attract huge attention. The prediction was not that bold. There was little doubt the supernova would happen. That's because Dr. Johnson didn't make a wild guess when making her prediction. Rather, she applied known and trusted laws of physics and mathematics, not easy to master, but easy to trust because they have been used so many times before to dependable results. The astronomer has gone onto a respected career, her prediction being one of many highpoints.

Supernovas are a natural phenomenon. As is planet formation, electricity, mass extinctions, infections, and millions of other things. By natural phenomenon, I mean these things are part of the natural world. They happen without humanity's involvement as part of the wonderful universe we live in. Because they surround use, we have good reason to understand what makes the natural world tick they way it does.

We used have a vague understanding of planet formation, electricity, and the other phenomenon. We once thought the Sun orbited the Earth. That the Earth and its species were only a few thousand years old. We even thought sickness was due to "bad air", which is why old hospitals were so often had their windows wide open, even in cold months.

This misunderstanding gave us odd behaviors. For example, it always amazed me that if our ancestors cleaned its wounds with alcohol (instead of drinking it), countless lives would have been saved from grusome deaths. Just think how many soldiers with a stab wound, loggers with a sliced hand, seamstresses with a pricked finger suffered terrible fates. Because of their ignorance, many patients drank themselves intoxicated to forget about the pain of their infected wounds. In the American Civil War, doctors even had whiskey bottles for this purpose. In contrast some people got lucky with their habits. During the Black Plague that killed 1/3 to 1/2 of Europe's population, a convent of nuns were spared because they happened to boil their laundry, and thereby happened to kill the ticks spreading the disease people thought was caused by "spontaneous generation" or the Devil.

These are but a few example of how having a vague understanding of the world around us made living a happy and healthy live so much harder. Happily, ignorance doesn't always last forever. Sometimes we uncover the reason behind the pains we feel. 

Because eventually we come to understand why natural phenomenon happen. The path to enlightenment is making tools that can gather enough evidence of the natural world so we can how we see the universe. When enough evidence is gathered, a remarkable individual envisions a new philosophy to explain the new world they see when looking around. Thereafter this person will declare old facts to be mythologies. Sir Issac Newton explained the laws of gravity. Charles Darwin uncovered the laws of evolution. Joseph Lister proved applying carbolic acid to patients after an operation would prevent infections because microorganisms naked to our eyes called "germs" were what really make people so sick.

These new philosophies of the world change how we see it.

Humanity started off as just another biological creature. Therefore we had very little understanding of the natural world beyond our senses. Gradually, with enough tools, we gathered enough evidence, to create totally new ideas that unlocked our ability to look out at the universe and understand it. Now we can often predict what the future will bring in astronomy, biology, medicine, physics, and many other fields. These areas still have arguments and ignorance, but our understanding is so large that these fields have mostly become self-perfecting, because the more we understand, the more we can build tools using our understanding. With better tools comes more facts, and therefore better answers. That's how handheld telescopes become space telescopes, alcohol disinfectant becomes cancer treatment, and the telegraph becomes the smartphones.

We don't yet have this level of understanding in our politics and economics. We have many belief systems that did their best to explain phenomenon like political revolutions, wars, and economic depressions. Each have elements of truth inside them, but like the world of our pre-breakthroughs they are not enough to make accurate predictions boring.

This book is the first in a series that puts politics and economics on the list of things humanity truly understand. It will make the natural phenomenon we experience everyday described via laws of nature.

- The first book explains the story of ongoing evolution.
- The second book introduces "Mixed-Ideological Politics", which is custom-designed to calm our politics and cure to the growing extremism in our society.
- The third book introduces "Bumblebee Economics", a novel economic system to help us unlock the super-productivity potential of Internet Age technology like 3D printers, crypto-currency, augmented reality, and artificial intelligence.

Prior breakthroughs were predicated on simple observations. Ones that were so quant they were almost childish in their insight. Yet they changed the world, but changing our perspective of our place inside it. Sir Issac Newton saw an apple fall, and thus thought maybe things fall the same way everywhere, on Earth and in the Heavens. He thus discovered the universal law of gravitation. Albert Einstein wondered about light, and realized it's speed was the limit anything could travel in the Universe, and thus he discovered General Relativity. These observations were groundbreaking, yet they were about events that happened since the dawn of time.

All of this insights that flow for these three books are based on one simple fact. Humanity is not a biological species. We haven't been for many years. And we each passing invention we left the biological kingom of Life behind. We did not start fire with our eyes. We did not chart the world with our hands. The ways in which we gather resources, protect ourselves from the elements, defend ourselves from danger, and so many more things, has increasingly been with technology. 

Humanity evolves with technology. And technological evolves according to the same rules of evolution as biological. Like watching the apple fall, once we become self-aware of these facts, we can harness the power and take control of natural phenomenon by writing natural laws.

To start us off, human technology co-evolution needed a new name, hence the new word "Techvolution."

Predictiond and clear explanations are the hallmark of any breakthrough. So, this book will explain what is happening today. Some of the coming answers are: 

- Why conservatives and progressives exist and need each other.
- How innovation happens and why innovative societies eventually stagnate.
- Why empires grow and die.
- Even the battle at the modern workplace.

But, before we can master our futures with this new philosophy, ideology, and economic system, we must understand the identities Nature wants us to have.

So what does it truly mean to be human?

- You are a character in the ongoing story of Life. But like Dr. Johnson showcased, we don't evolve biologically. It's not like she used her intuition to say when the star would explode, like she didn't use her eyes to see it happen. 

## Foreword

To be done. Or redone. Not the 2084 mother, that'll stay for MIP.

## Chapter 1 - The Story of Life

Life is a beautiful story.

How can it not be? It's the ultimate rags-to-riches tale. Our planet was once lifeless. Then over three billion years ago, some cells formed in pools of acid. From that ooze, spunky Life created an almost endless list of bacteria, plants, fungi, and animals. Life turned the third rock from the Sun into an oasis. But success wasn't and still isn't a forgone conclusion. The story of Life has always been very dramatic...
