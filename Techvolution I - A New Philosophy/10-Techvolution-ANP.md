## Dedication

_This book is for the open-source community — for the collaboration mindset you handed down to me while updating Wikipedia, writing free software, and answering endless questions on StackOverflow. You showed a political student what the future could be as you became the protagonists of the Internet Age. Still, I hope this book inspires you to (no offense) stop making JavaScript frameworks and coding unused side projects because you must create the Internet Age economy, build-step by build-step, posthaste._

_This book is especially dedicated to the extras on Main Street. When it’s time for you to act, I pray you decide to play the game of evolution and reach for the future that the open-source heroes have built for you._

"_We are really the revolutionaries in the world today—not the kids with long hair and beards who were wrecking the schools a few years ago._"

Dr. Gordon Moore, author of Moore's Law, 1973.


## Preface

On September 29th 2014 Dr. Johnson made a prediction. He said that in seven years, three months, two days, at 10:11 AM EST, star number 9338 would explode.

Dr. Johnson was a newly minted astrophysicist. Giving a prediction seven years in advance, about an event that was two billion light years away was quite bold. Some people have difficulty knowing their house value next year, and she was predicting an event so far away in time and distance. Happily, Dr. Johnson was taken seriously and the scientific community aimed their telescope and captured what came could be called "God's Clapping" photograph.

It's quite the image if you feel like looking it up. If you did, it would probably be the first time you would see the image; it didn't attract huge attention. This is because the prediction wasn't that bold. There was little doubt the supernova would happen. That's because Dr. Johnson didn't make a wild guess when making her prediction. Rather, she applied known and trusted laws of physics and mathematics, not easy to master, but easy to trust because they have been used so many times before to dependable results. The astronomer has gone onto a respected career, her prediction being one of many highpoints.

Supernovas are a natural phenomenon. As is planet formation, electricity, mass extinctions, infections. By natural phenomenon, I mean these things happen without humanity's involvement; they are part of the natural world we must live in. We thus have a reason to understand what makes the natural world tick they way it does.

We used have a vague understanding of planet formation, electricity, and other phenomenon. We once thought the Sun orbited the Earth. That the Earth and its species were only a few thousand years old. We even thought sickness was due to "bad air", which is why old hospitals were so often had their windows wide open, even in cold months.

It always amazes me that if humanity just cleaned its wounds with alcohol (instead of drinking it), countless lives would have been saved from grusome deaths. Just think how many soldiers with a stab wound, loggers with a sliced hand, seamstresses with a pricked finger suffered terrible fates. Because of their ignorance, many patients drank themselves intoxicated to forget about the pain of their infected wounds. In the American Civil War, doctors even had whiskey bottles for this purpose. During the Black Plague that killed 1/3 to 1/2 of Europe's population, a convent of nuns were spared because they happened to boil their laundry, and thereby happened to kill the ticks spreading the disease people thought was caused by "spontaneous generation" or the Devil.

These are but a few example of how having a vague understanding of the world around us made living a happy and healthy live so much harder. Happily, ignorance doesn't always last forever. Sometimes we uncover the reason behind the pains we feel. 

Because eventually we come to understand why natural phenomenon happen. The path to enlightenment is making tools that can gather enough evidence of the natural world so we can how we see the universe. When enough evidence is gathered, a remarkable individual formulates a new philosophy. Thereafter this person will do declare old facts to be mythologies. Sir Issac Newton explained the laws of gravity. Charles Darwin uncovered the laws of evolution. Joseph Lister proved applying carbolic acid to patients after an operation would prevent infections because microorganisms naked to our eyes called "germs" were what really make people so sick.

These new philosophies of the world change how we see it.

Humanity started off as just another biological creature. Therefore we had very little understanding of the natural world beyond our senses. Gradually, with enough tools, we gathered enough evidence, to create totally new ideas that unlocked our ability to look out at the universe and understand it. Now we can often predict what the future will bring in astronomy, biology, medicine, physics, and many other fields. These areas still have arguments and ignorance, but our understanding is so large that they've mostly become self-perfecting, because the more we understand, the more we can build tools using our understanding. That's how handheld telescopes become space telescopes, alcohol disinfectant becomes cancer treatment, and the telegraph becomes the smartphones. As we

This book will change how you see the world of politics and economics with a new philosophy. It will explain the natural phenomenon so that when you look out into the world ....controlled these areas of the natural world. 

But there are areas in which we don't understand. Despite all our advances, we do not yet have this mastery of Nature over politics and economics. We have many belief systems that did their best to explain phenomenon like violent political revolutions, wars, and economic depressions. Each have elements of truth inside them, but like the world of our pre-breakthroughs they are not enough so that accurate predictions are boring.

This book is the first in a series that puts politics and economics on the list of things humanity truly understand. It will clarify and open your eyes so that natural ph are described via laws of nature that have controlled our politics and economics. In the later books of this series we'll discuss both in great detail and introduce Mixed-Ideological Politics and Bumblebee Economics.

This book will explain what is happening today. Events that are driving us toward hatred and war will be made clear. 

- Trump's presidency
- The Reaction against him
- The fight to 
- Even the battle at the modern workplace.

You are a character in the ongoing story of Life. But like Dr. Johnson showcased, we don't evolve biologically. It's not like she used her intuition to say when the star would explode, like she didn't use her eyes to see it happen. We evolve with technology, and philosophies that help us use technology to understand our world.

But, wefore we can master our futures with this new ideology and economic syste, we must understand the identities Nature wants us to have.

So what does it mean to be human?
