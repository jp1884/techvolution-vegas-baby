# The Interview

A real life depiction juxtaposition of getting a job/interviewing with Darth Blockbuster, and not. Or better yet, a day in the life of red / blue under Darth Blockbuster, and then under the Life Star.

Example:

- wake up with alarm clock / wake up when rested.
- drive to work regarldess of time / drive to gathering, but decide to Skype in because weather is bad.
- listen to "hawaian" shirt day / wear what you want.
- listen to customer complain / tell customer they're the problem.
- waste gas, drive by accident / walk at lunch.
- job interview, showcase loyalty / talk about the problems you solved faster and better.
- go to CIP class / learn a new skill.
- tell friends to come over and watch TV / go on an adventure.
- etc...

## TAKEN FROM BROKEN CAR EXAMPLE

Now consider it's often against the rules to solve our problems so simply. Patent laws, insurance regulations, nondisclosure agreements, non-compete clauses; a mountain of rules any antagonist can search through so he can force us to keep walking to gas stations.

Darth Blockbuster is in control. He's dedicated to keeping control. And he's no protagonist. He can't be a hero, because unlike Neo, Cinderella, Romeo and Juliette he's not mentally capable of rising above the situation, and seeing a solution to what he thinks is a fact of life. Cars break down, deal with it. And when someone asks him to solve the problem, his face goes blank. He can't pass that question on the test. He can't run fast enough to make the team. He can't throw a spiral. So his dad comes over and asks the coach to do him a favor on put him on the team anyway. That favour is the rules Darth Blockbuster asks government, corporations, and culture to keep the extras using old tools.

That's why a small company like Tesla had to bring modern cars to America. They didn't have early access to new technology, different tools, a magic wans. Tesls is run by people who _can_ see problems. They can answer that question on the test, they can run fast enough, they can throw a spiral. So they're father sits proudly in the seats. Darth Blockbuster should be beside him. Yet, he gets to be captain because he pays for it.

Ignore revolutions! Digital tools and their many Jedi innovators, coders, technicians, designers, repair shops, are ready and waiting to solve real-life problems, it's intoxicating to them. We just need Techvolution, the freedom to choose the best tools to solve our problems at home, work, and leisure. The people ignoring red/blue talk, and only demanding tools to solve their problems, with the freedom to majically bonding with whatever tool they want, is the ultimate revolution.
