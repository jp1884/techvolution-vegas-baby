## The Problem

So do you think Darth Blockbuster is dead? Do you think he'll ever die? Do you feel the weight of the questin on your shoulders, Stargazer. Do you feel itâ€”the weight of the world? The mantle of fate? As we create a new philosophy to rule our society's deepest definitions of right and wrong in all areas from politics to economics?

You shouldn't. For this book was merely a lesson in the history of political philosophy. Which is history of sequels.

I didn't write this book to create a new ruling philosophy that we'll use to make a new rule book. Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, St. Augustine, Francis Bacon, John Locke, even my favorite Rousseau could't make a political philosophy that, when applied inside a rule book, was agreed upon by everyone.

Protagonists and antagonists still fought over tools, and the extras were stuck in between trying to figure out who the bad guys were. Most of political philosophy is basically new version of my "one good story, and two bad stories" explanation. The point is in the 2300 years of politcal philosophy we're still here aruging over if its okay for someone to download download a movie or not.

Regardless of the political philosophy, human frailty taints its application when writing the rulebook to govern everyday life. Power corrupts man, turning once classical heroes (and especially their descendants) into self-important "art" film characters who use their money to distract the masses with spectacle. When spectacle doesn't work they use their Death Star rule book to hold on for as long as possible.

Thus, I didn't write this so Techvolution will replace red/blue politics with its own rule book. Even though it would be an improvement, it wouldn't all that digital tools make possible. I only wrote this book to wipe old rule books away.

Because digital tools are the telescope showing us the Nature in a new light. One that finally let's us finally see the "visions of the just and good society" the philosophers dreamed about.

So come Stargazer, with your mind wipe clean up old philosophies, and human written rule books, we can now find true answers to the human condition as we tear the mask of Nature, and stare into the face of God.
