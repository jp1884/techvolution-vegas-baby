# Polar Bears in the Amazon

If you were to see camels in Norway, tree frogs in Mongolia, or polar bears in the Amazon you'd automatically see something wrong. Not with the lifeform, we take our kids to visit these cuties in the zoo, but you'd see an obivous mix-match of a lifeform in a foreign ecosystem.

Now when you see SUVâ€™s in Shanghai, daily newspapers in England, American McMansions, coal power-plants in the Sunshine State, and another Spider Man playing throughout the world, you wouldn't see the same mix-match. Even though England has few paper mills, China no oil fields, Florida no coal, or Americans having no desire build and clean their own mansions. You wouldn't see the same mix-match between lifeform/adaptation and it's ecosystem, because you wouldn't see foriegn lifeforms because you wouldn't see different ecosystems, as you automatically do with a polar bear in the Amazon.

When Europe entered the Renaissance and Scientific Revolution, the ruling nobility hit the jackpot. The society's they controlled developed new tools that made them the strongest in the worlds Ships that could travel against the wind, navigate at night, and rule the seas. Guns that could kill from hundreds of yards away. Books that could educate about the best military tactics, navigation, and agriculture methods. The nobles used this power to spread themselves, as they spent the 1500-1900 colonizing the world with their rules.

Yet, these political empires didn't last. And there was nothing that could have made them last. The reason is a simple one. The rules, and way of life of England, France, Spain, is not the way of life that will prosper somewhere else. Nature adapts lifefotms to local problems inside ecosystems. Humans evolve with tools. Thus, we need ecosystems to adapt. World wide rules and empires are like trying to have little biodiversity.

It's impossible. A dream. The European nobility fought to keep it alive for centuries. They fought the wave of independece to local governments could make their own rules, customized for their own political ecosystems.

And now, our world-wide mass produced, free-trade, global rules that sustain the pre-digital tools of suburban housing, blockbuster movies, gas cars, fasionabe clothing are merely the same thing Darth King's political empires. Economic empires of Darth Blockbuster trying to have his economic cake and eat it too.

Darth Blockbuster is trying to make polar bears live in the Amazon. And the extras are stuck using the wrong tools to solve the frontline problems.

## The Buffet Line

Okay Skywalker, so I said to ignore red / blue philosophies. But I'll indulge this one here for your and mine sake. What I just told you, that the world economy has to divide into mostly self-suffcient ecosystems isn't simple. It'll eventually happen, I mean cyborgs from Nova Scotia and Jordan need different tools to prosper for the same reasons their natural lifeforms have different tools to prosper. Their enviornments are totally different. And if the same political laws didn't work in both ex-British empire places, why should the same tools for transportation, agriculture, education, entertainment and so forth.

But this simple observation will cause a huge backlash from Darth Blockbuster and blue / red politics. The ideology of one tool fights all is their meal ticket. The business side wants to sell their tools in every ecosystem, so fights for one world of economy. The cultural side wants to integrate the world's people, and so fights for one world culture. A single world economy is a team effort. And it pays well. And so they'll fight back.

The argument will be basically this. That mass producing tools, even if they aren't customized for a ecosystem, is more efficient. That it's better to have lots of generic foxes, then less customized artic or desert ones. Pre digital tools that might have been true, but with 3D printing, cheap computing, easy knowledge, digital tools, it's simply not. It's better to make whatever tool best solves a frontline problem.

Mountains of think tank policy papers, corporate future plans, consultant forecasts, will say otherwise. Movies, cars, homes, fuel, manufacturing should all be mass produced. Because this generates wealth for everyone to enjoy. International bankers, lawyers, executives at G8 meetings, Davos, Aspen, and others will talk about how world economy products enough to give a buffet of wealth for everyone.

To defeat the attacks, and they will simply attack and not argue, ask for their place in the buffet. So sure, no problem mister 500 dollar an hour lawyer, I'll stick with you, just can we switch wages. I'll write a regulation for climate change action, and you can do technical customer support, with stagnate wages and a boss who keeps threatening to outsource me if I don't work weekends for free.

They of course won't. They'll say they earned their place. And that reveals their identity. They believed in a heirarchy, and they earned their high place in it by following the rules. They want to University and said the right things. They joined an international corporation, and followed the rules, and said the write things. And you didn't. They rose about the frontline and deserve to be rewarded.

But Techvolution is about frontline people solving frontline problems with digital tools. No heirachries, just problem solving. So when you are confronted by the heirarchy wanting you to be a polar bear in the Amazon, just ask them to switch spots.

I don't know everything in life. I don't know much at all. But I do know you'll always still be here. And that should tell you all you need to know.
