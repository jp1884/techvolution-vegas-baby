# This is Real

We're in a pandemic. People are shocked, scared, and quite unhappy. It's like watching a good movie. One that  has us wondering what's going to happen next. But this is isn't fiction; it's real-life. And it could have been so much easier.

I'll tell you why.

First do me a favour. Get all your medical records ready. Okay good. Now, collect all your health metrics from your FitBit or Apple Watch. Great, now let's evaluate how much of a risk Covid-19 is to your life by comparing your statistics, to the records of sick people; especially the ones around your area. Know to top-off this investigation, what does your doctor say about your chance of death?

Since I don't know you, so I can only hope you're a low risk factor. But, in the worst case scenario, if you're a high risk, at least now you've been told so by your doctor. Knowledge is the great lever of power after all.

Wait, wait. Is they lever stuck? This is a pandemic, a motherfucking pandemic! A real-life movie! Complete uncertainy! And you don't have your medical records! Where the fuck are they? You don't even know! Well at least your doctor is... shit, your doctor hasn't even reviewed your risk factor. Fuck this! Dude, are you just waiting around watching CNN, and reading random bullshit on the internet during a pandemic?

You are. I am. We all are. We entered the Internet Age in 1970. And despite using it's awesome technology to tweet, post, and stream everyday, we're still using Industrial Age philosophies to run our lives. For generations, we've thought health-care meant arguing for private or public health insurance. Yet, with both, every person is still today reading mass-produced broadcasts instead of interacting with health professionals. 

Here's why your living blind during the Great Pandemic of 2020.

In this TED talk by a doctor Doctor Alieta Eck says when she started medical school in the early 80's, she thought being a doctor meant connecting with her patients. She dreamed of being deeply involved, and helping them live healthier lives. She pictured examinations, home visits, and phone calls.

However, since she entered practiced, she's increasingly gotten something far different.

Dr. Eck started medicine in the early 1980s. Towards the beginning of a growing trend. Since 1970, ever more people have been putting themselves in the middle of doctors and their patients. Administers have gone up every single year. Dr. Eck notes how doctors spend far more time doing adminstrative paperwork then dealing with their patients health.

That's called administrative creep. Government regulators, project managers, hospital administrators, claims adjusters, insurance underwriters, lawyers, and more meetings then anyone can imagine. All these people are doing work that digital technology can replace like robotics did for manufacturing. As digital technology has given us a more complicated health-system, the people inside it have given themselves control over that systems levers of power like medical records, health-costs, and etc.

Technological speaking, there is absolutely no reason for this. There's also no reason whatsoever your records can't be cross-referenced against your health statistics to tell you your risk factor to Covid-19. And, if doctors weren't spending so much damn time with paperwork, they could talk to their patients proactively and help the ones in most need to weather this storm.

And the Internet Age has even more power to offer. Like renting someone's room on Airbnb, Uber arranging drives, or Quora answering one of our questions, when the people control the levers of power, we can collaborate to help ourselves to great effect. For example, watch _The Pharmicist_ on Netflix, and you'll see how a simple online database of prescriptions identified and stopped Oxycontin pill mills. Too bad it took years to make. If done sooner the oxycontin epidemic could very well have been stopped dead.

We don't because since entering the Internet Age, we've been held back by a ever-more middle-men. People who antagonist our progress. I call them Darth Blockbuster because they harm our civilization out of self-interest.

Please don't tell me that doctors have something better to do then review your status. Or that having your health records means someone might steal them. Of course doctors are still busy, but if you're risk factor is low, at least you know it officially. And if your risk factor changes, wouldn't that be nice to know, officially. Second, all your health records are online, spread around clinics, hospitals, and insurance companies. Workers at each have the passwords. The last person who does is you.

The definition of a healthy civilization is your personal happiness. And right now, people are beyond unhappy. Pandemics will never go away, but when we upgrade our way of life to the Internet Age, then we'll learn to deal with them better than we are so far.

Techvolution gives you the new philosophy to upgrade. One that makes you a player god so you have much more control of your own life.
