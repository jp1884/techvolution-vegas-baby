# TECHVOLUTION: A NEW PHILOSOPHY

You, me, and everyone else quarantined in their houses are anxiously waiting for the COVID-19 storm to pass.

On the bright side, we have Netflix.

Thanks to online streaming, our worries are easily replaced with tales of passionate love, wicked magic spells, and galaxies far far away.

Stories are compelling because they're simple. Protagonists are good because they want to fix a problem. Antagonists are bad because they don't.

Free from any debate, we cheer for the protagonist. Thus, Romeo and Juliet's love is beautiful and worth dying for! While their families' feud is ignorant and stupid. Luke Skywalker's rebellion is righteous and worth fighting for! While Darth Vader's empire is hellish and must be destroyed.

Our heroes are always brave. But that's not enough. That's why Hogwarts students and Jedi Knights always reach for their wands and lightsabers.

But so does the enemy.

We hold our breath and wonder who better controls the power of magic, the force, and technology; light or dark side? Unlike us, the protagonists can't sit back and enjoy the drama.

Because nobody ever won a battle by watching it. The victors are the ones who control the levers of power.

And that is the big lesson restless and quarantined Main Street must learn today. Otherwise, this pandemic was for nothing.

Talk to any political junkie, no matter when, and they'll say there's a big election coming up. They'll tell you, "if the Right-wing win, infrastructure, healthcare, everything will go to hell!"

If you buy it—and most of us have at some point—you glue yourself to Left-wing blogs, radio, and TV. Filled with Left-wing philosophy, you start seeing evil Conservatives everywhere. Or, if you got sucked in by the other side, you see devilish Progressives instead.

But it's all bullshit.

Despite Left/Right yelling matches, neither ideology is your enemy. Because neither is your hero. Both are happiest sending you one-way messages to tune-in, protest, or donate. Like a bad friend, Left/Right ideologues only want your attention and money.

Galileo, George Washington, and Luke Skywalker reached for the power of new technology. Why shouldn't the middle-class overcome our problems by holding modern levers of power? Isn't our healthcare, infrastructure, and especially our pandemic response, worthy of upgrades?

Of course they are. And, that's the point.

The feud between Left and Right is a distraction. The politics of upgrading our lives (or not) is the real political game of our time.

This contest started in 1970, when our civilization left the Industrial Age, entered the Internet Age.

The owners of industrial technology don't want you holding internet technology like Netflix. In fact, "Darth Blockbuster" is working hard to antagonize all future technology.

Happily, many internet geeks are fighting to put these levers of power in your hands.

Main Street must jump-in and help the protagonists.

There is no debate. Because if we don't upgrade our society soon, this pandemic only foreshadows a much more terrible storm to come.

This book will teach you how to win the game to we upgrade our entire civilization with amazing new technology.

It'll be a story worth telling once you realize politics is a game worth playing.
