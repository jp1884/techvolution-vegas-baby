## Evolution Needs a Choice

Do you believe in Techvolution? Do you think Right/Left philosophy is outdated? Do you see why the era of mass-production should be replaced by mass-collaboration? Do you want to hold levers of power in your society, instead of complaining, protestig, and begging the powerbrokers for help. Do you see through the endless rules of the Industrial Age as bullshit. Can you see the dark majic around gas cars, 9-5 workdays, call-centres, paper-forms—the entire 1969 way of life that keeps us away from the Internet Age?

That fate of civilization is on your shoulders. Your job is to do what's best for yourself, and help society prosper. Looking up for guidance you now see two options. Open-source heroes of the Internet Age who keep innovating, thinking ahead, while fiiling the world with the majic of evolution. And the self-importance, short-sightedness of Darth Blockbuster, the fallen hero of the Industrial Age who uses the trickery of dark majic and a corrupted rulebook to keep himself in power.

You an internet cyborg, inside the Industrial Age philosophy. The only question is, what philosophy do you believe in? Deciding the ruling philosophy is your Main Street's power. It's a battle as old as civilization between Protagonist vs. Antagonist. Inventor vs. Noble. And now Player God vs. Extra.

The fate of civilization is a simple question. Who are you Stargazer? Will you be a player god or an extra? We all await your choice. The conclusion of Techvolution: A New Philosophy is thus a simple choice inside your head. Which might look something like this.

## Two Worlds

I want you to imagine two worlds. The first is a place you've lived in your entire life. It's the conscience world that you can see, taste. Inside this world, you are a lifeform that needs resources. You thus, go to school, get a degree, and apply for jobs.

You apply to dozens and dozens of jobs. You don't know anything about the work culture, the bosses, the co-workers. Is it a happy and efficient workplace, or a sinking ship? You can't find out, so you go to the interviews and answer some bullshit questions from the HR rep whose probably never even done the job you're there to do. You eventually get a job, and make some money. With eight different bosses, everyone is on edge because everyone's job is replaceable.

You're not happy, so you buy stuff. Televisions, ATV's, vacations. But you spend 60% of your time at work, 20% in your car, and whatever's left sleeping or socializing.

While you use modern technology at your home life. Google Home, Facebook, Amazon Prime, these companies don't "distrupt" as they like to say your work life. They are like the enlightened monarchs of old. Very well intentioned modern companies, but in the end, still massive heirarchies. They don't want too empwer the frontline too much. They still us to be extras, clicking the ads to buy dark majic products.

But these companies still fuel the future. Because they helped build open-source technology. Now you can build your own society. Literally, like in a Civilization computer game. You can build a better YouTube. You can fight for the "Right to Repair". You can starting using Figma, WikiBooks, Stack Overflow, and start collaborating with people like you to improve your world.

The internet a


## The End, or the Beginning

I'm going to stop there. I've run out of time. More importantly, I can't think for you. Nor do I want to keep holding your hand. This book has been informative enough. You understand that regular people feel the pain of real-life, and to evolve humanity, we have to drop old tools, and pick up new ones. But to pull these levers of power, we need a new philosophy that turns us into player gods of the game.

So, the future is on your shoulders. Antagonists will never stop. Open-source protagonists have done their job. I personally just want to live in a place were life prospers. That's why I pray you decide to play the game, like our ancestors did for us so many times.

The solution to our unhappiness is upgrading to the Internet Age and embracing the era of mass-collaboration. To do that, we need Techvolution, a new philosophy that gives the right, and duty, to frontline people to use digital tools to solve their real-life problems. Letting antagonists decide is stupid, while believing in Left/Right philosophies is a recipe for living in the past.

Look around, and see old drafty windows, gas engine car, cable news, mass-producted toys, eight different bosses, car traffic, endless red-tape... Do you see the Industrial Age? Are you willing to overcome dark majic and drop old tools and become a proud Internet Age cyborg who solves todays frontline problems?

Or do you want to return to the comfort and safety of being a 1969 cyborg, bragging about gas cars, fake job titles, and McMansions, while following the antagonists rules, and chasing the phantoms of Conservative/Progressive politics in a very unhappy life. Did Techvolution click? The fate of your life, your kids, and of your society, rests on the simple question—will you step up and become a player god in the game of civlization?

If you do, we win. If you don't, we lose.
