## Introduction

Before we go any futher, I want to lay out the philosophy of Techvolution more clearly. To do so, here are a few terms that will enable us to all be on the same page:

===

Philosophy: the largely unspoken ideals that tell members of society what’s right and wrong, good and bad, in science, art, morals, politics and economics. A civilization's collective consciouness used by members to make rules around questions like: what is scientific truth? Who should govern? And how should resources be organized?

Ruling philospophy: is a civilization’s chosen philosophy. One that all factions agree on. Like the “Divine Rights of Kings” derived from Christian theology used in royalist Europe, “Marxist-Leninism” of the Soviet Union, or the combination of “red / blue” philosophies of our philosophy today.

Technology: a catchall term for things we make tools from, like concrete, lumber, nails, shingles, insulation, and bricks.

Tool: a catchall term for things we create with technology to solve a problem, like guns to kill bad guys, books to record and pass on knowlege, and houses to shelter in.

Frontline: The point of contact between a tool and the problem. A movie usher talking to moviegoers, nurses talking to patients, cleaners cleaning a bus, police chasing a robber, soldiers on the battlefield. People on the frontline have jobs to solve problems.

Hierarchy: Every tool develops a power structure to manage its use in society. Feudalism's castles and their rigid hierarchy of nobles, church, knights, merchants and peasants is an easy example. We usually reward those who rise in a hierarchy with power and prestige. Leaders naturally become distanced from the frontline, and struggle to relate to reality. People inside have titles to mark their positions in power.

Civilization story: The invention of new technology and creation of new tools to overcome whatever problem troubles us. We use tools to evolve.

Protagonists: people who invent, spread, and use new technology and new tools for the greater good. Usually close to the problems on the frontline, they individually struggle, but their continued self-sacrifice slowly improves life on Earth. We call their leaders trailblazers who often skirt the rules; Nikola Tesla, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk.

Antagonists: people who selfishly resist new tools to defend their wealth, power, and prestige. Often called establishment or elites, antagonists usually manage companies or institutions based on dated technologies and think working on the frontline is beneath them. They hide behind rules, which they work to control. We don't often individually identify them. I invented "Darth Blockbuster" so we can.

Extras: everybody in the middle of a battle between antagonist and protagonist. Because they have no direct loyalty to either side or their tools, extras can pick winners and losers. Usually extras are in the middle class; not so poor as to be desperate, but not so powerful they want to keep the world the same. Sadly, extras don't realize their power.

Techvolution: a new philosophy empowering seemless human technological evolution by ridding Darth Blockbuster of his power, by empowering extras to decide when society should upgrade our tools.
