## My App

My app. Using modern web development, it took just a few months of work. Take some free code from GitHub, an inexpensive cloud computing account, and the design skills of a novice. It was simple. Might not even get me a job in "tech".

The tool wasn't polished because new tools never are. It was, would have been, so effective because it came directly from the frontline. A place far away from today's ruling philosophy.

Here's how it worked. Today's car insurance claim system depends on drivers exchanging information like names or insurance policy numbers after a car accident. Drivers are frazzled and scared of strangers, so they usually don't. My adjusting job was talking to these drivers to process their insurance claims. The one supposed to return drivers back to normal; at least as best to normal as money can get them. A big problem was simply knowing who the other driver and adjuster were. Since we often didn't know, we had to search for it-literally calling around, or hoping someone calls you. Delays piled up like crazy.

Adjusting sucks. People assume we try to short change them, but the truth is we overpaid to compensate for processing delays all because the tools we adjusters had are a telephone, email, voicemail, checkbook, google, and a supervisor telling us to hurry up or get fired. Beyond st-st-stress ~~stressful~~, very emotionally taxing.

Until you speak with a driver who is a real person.

Real person because their accident wasn't an inconvenience, but a life changing horror. Maybe their arm was amputated, or their friend is in the Intensive Care Unit, or their kid burned alive twelve hours ago.

You're mind shuts Darth Blockbuster up the moment you talk to this real person. They have a problem and your soul wants to help.

Why did this happen? That's all drivers want to know. Was someone trying to beat a red light? Was the road not salted for ice. Was it drunk driving? What's the reason for the sudden terror of pain. It's soothing knowing why the accident happened, it helps knowing it won't happen again.

My app combined several existing technologies, email, internet, GPS, google maps, and web apps, to make a new tool. It let insurance adjusters post an accident on a google map, and verified their identity by their work email. Since every accident shares the GPS coordinates, all adjusters, regardless what drivers do, can find each other. It's minimal operating cost was paid for by rental car companies and repair shops, who loved the ability to email invoices directly to adjusters without have to call first.

A simple new tool that only someone on the frontline would ever feel the pain to make.

Society would have save hundreds of millions in insurance claim operating costs. That's cool. Adjusters's and drivers would save hours of their day. That's cool too. But this is the part worth fighting over. With my app, for the first time, we'd have a database of the exact location and causes of car accidents. Thereafter we could cross reference with weather, traffic, demographics, and many other databases. We'd finally learn why car accidents happen, and start to fight back.

This database doesn't exist today. So when branches grow over stop signs, tires are faulty, intersections jam up too much, roads aren't salted, or anything else repeatedly causes accidents, we don't even know. With machine learning and artifical intelligence, we'd find trends to the millions of accidents, and tens of thousands of deaths that happen every year. Who loses?

People happy with the way things are, who've never spoken with a driver, and don't feel frontline pain. It was their the blank faces, the clueless looks, the arrogant smirks of the executives, lawyers, marketers, and consultants who stood in the way of a new tool that angered me so much it merged years of political theory in my mind, and let me see a new ruling philosophy called Techvolution clearly in my head.

It was still hard writing this book. It was condensing so much political and economic theory and history into such a short space. I was mentally very tired, and despite indulging in Jack Jones' "The Impossible Dream" too much, a little bitter. Then I watched an episode of Netflix's _Black Mirror_ and went back to work.

This episode was the tale of a crazed man, who wants to talk with the powerful CEO of an Instagram like app called Smithereens. He holds a company intern hostage awaiting the CEO's call. Police surround him, corporate lackies try to deflect him, bullets are fired at him, but he still wants his phone call. Nobody knows why.

I started to cry. I soon wept. I knew why. Because I knew this crazed man.

I knew distracted driving killed someone close to him. The crazed man had been driving, and he checked his Smithereen feed, saw a picture of a dog or something, and he missed a drunk running a stop sign, and his beloved fiancee died.

I didn't know it was his own distracted driving, but I knew the pain the actor played out so well. He just wanted to tell someone why it happened, so maybe it wouldn't happen again. I knew that because I used my soul to ease this person's pain for years.

I made a new tool that would have helped. Not solved. Not actual magic, but it majically would have gotten us closer. The help, and the example of the Life Star I wanted to show, was against the rules, so Darth Blockbuster stopped it.

He'll never say that, or even know it. He thinks frontline pain is a thing to manage not ever feel and solve with new tools.

I did my best as a protagonist. Not good enough to prevent anyone's accident, but I did my best. The point isn't self-pity. The point is self-pity doesn't need to exist in the digital age. For the philosophy of digital tools isn't a place of sword weilding heroes with a mass of peasants behind them. I pushed as far and high as I could. Now another protagonist can pick up where I left off. Everyone is either an extra choosing the best tools, or a hero working to earn their favour, in the ruling philosophy of Techvolution.

Rest assured, the millions of protagonists inside the open-source community are making an app far more powerful than my little thing. Darth Blockbuster can't stop it, because the Sith are defeated. The're lawsuits, corporate rules, red / blue marches, worked to suppress digital tools since the 1970's. No more.

The question is, now that Darth Blockbuster isn't weighing us down, what should we do with the immense knowledge and resources the Life Star gives us. What future should the Jedi in the open-source community build.

All us geeks have dreamed of it everytime we watch not a galaxy far far away, but the one with the continuing mission to explore strange new worlds. We have to start somewhere; like the Moon, Mars, and beyond. I think we all want live in the world of Captain Picard's a rational society, where problem-solving trumps rules, individuals always contributeths, but science, technology and tools govern the story of civlization.

That's coming up in the sequel, the book I originally wrote, _Techvolution: Starting Starfleet_.

### Personal Note on Political Philosophy: The Prince and the Executive

This was the the executive. It will do for economics what the prince did for science and later on for politics. putting humans below the story, and letting the truth of the world as seen and sensed by tools, to determine our truths. human affairs, especially economic ones of what we make and use, needs the same transition as science, and democracy has today.

If it was called and presented that, you'd likely seen it through red and blue eyes. I hoped to showcase how the prince changed and belittled human thinking but that meant to empower it with science that has done more to improve humanity's progress than anything else in history.

I wish this book means humanity will never need another lesson. That's probably too idealistic. So hopefully this books will make it easier the next time human hubris gets in the way of heavenly progress.
