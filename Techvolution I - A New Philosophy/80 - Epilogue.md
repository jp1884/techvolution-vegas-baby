# EPILOGUE

## My App

My app. Using modern web development, it took but a few weeks of work. Take some free code from GitHub, an inexpensive cloud computing account, and the design of a novice. It was simple. Might not even get me a job in "tech".

The tool wasn't polished because new tools never are. It was, would have been, so effective because it came directly from the frontline. A place far away from today's ruling philosophy.

Here's how it worked. Today's car insurance claim system depends on drivers exchanging information like names or insurance policy numbers. Drivers are scared and frazzled so they usually don't. My adjusting job was talking to these drivers to process their insurance claims. The one supposed to return drivers back to normal. Or at least as best to normal as money can get them. A big problem was simply knowing who the other driver and adjuster were. Without policy numbers or phone numbers, delays pile up like crazy.

Adjusting sucks. The only tools we adjusters have are telephone, email, voicemail, checkbook, google, and a supervisor telling us to hurry up or get fired. Beyond st-st-stress ~~stressful~~, very emotionally taxing.

Until you speak with a driver who is a real person.

Real people because their accident accident wasn't an inconvenience, but a life changing horror. Maybe they lost an arm, or their friend is in the Intensive Care Unit, or their kid burned alive twelve hours ago.

You're mind disregards your supervisor's threats the moment you talk to this real person. They have a problem and your soul wants to help.

Why did this happen? That's all they want to know. Was someone trying to beat a red light? Was the road not salted for ice. Was it drunk driving? What's the reason for the sudden terror of pain.

The frontline is the intersection between problems and tools. WHen one of our tools failed, a person died. Grief can only fight the pain by fighting to make sure this problem wont happen again.

My app combined several technologies, email, internet, GPS, google maps, and web apps, to make a new tool.

It let insurance adjusters post an accident on a google map, and verified their identity by their work email. Since every accident shares the GPS coordinates, all adjusters, regardless what drivers do, can find each other. It's minimal operating cost was paid for by rental car companies and repair shops, who loved the ability to send invoices directly to adjusters without have to call first.

A simple new tool that only someone on the frontline would ever feel the pain to make.

Society would have save hundreds of millions in insurance claim operating costs. That's cool. Adjusters's would save hours of their day. That's cool too. But this is the part worth fighting over. With my app, for the first time, we'd have a database of the exact location and causes of car accidents. Thereafter we could cross reference with weather, traffic, and many other databases. We'd finally learn why car accidents happens, and start to fight back.

This database doesn't exist today. So when branches grow over stop signs, tires are faulty, intersections jam up too much, a section of highway doesn't get enough salt, or anything else, is repeatedly causing accidents, we don't even know.

With machine learning and artifical intelligence, we'd find trends to the millions of accidents, and tens of thousands of deaths, that happen every year. And fight back. Who loses?

People who don't feel the pain. People happy with the way things are. Seeing the blank faces, the clueless looks, the complete arrogance of the executives, lawyers, marketers, and consultants who stood in the way of the frontline workers, and the unlucky ones grieving in pain, waiting for this solution, merged years of political theory in my mind and let me see a new ruling philosophy called Techvolution clearly in my head.

It was still hard writing this book. It was condensing so much history and political theory in such a short space. I was mentally very tired and despite indulging in Jack Jones' "The Impossible Dream" too much, a little bitter. Then I watched an episode of Netflix's _Black Mirror_ and went back to work.

This episode was the tale of a crazed man, out to talk with the powerful CEO of an Instagram like app called Smithereens. He holds a company intern hostage awaiting his call. Police surround him, corporate lackies try to deflect him, shots are fired at him, but he still wants his phone call. Nobody knows why.

I soon started to cry. My eyes making puddles as I full out wept. I knew this crazed man.

I knew a distracted driving killed someone close to him. The crazed man had been driving, and he checked his Smithereen feed, saw a picture of a dog or something, and he missed a drunk running a stop sign, and his beloved fiancee died. [remember lightsabre, wasn't yet turned on by Techvolution.]

I didn't guess it was his own distracted driving, but I knew the pain the actor played out so well. I used my soul to ease this person's pain for years.

I made a new tool that would have helped. Not solved. Not actual magic, but it majically would have gotten us closer. Darth Blockbuster stopped it. He'll never say that, or even know it. To him the frontline is a place to stand above, not live within.

I did my best as a protagonist. I still wonder how many lives were lost because I failed going all the way, but I did my best. The point isn't self-pity. The point is self-pity doesn't need to exist in the digital age. For the philosophy of digital tools isn't a place of heroic individuals with a mass of extras behind them. I pushed as far as I could. Someone better suited to the problem can pick up where I left off and keep going. Everyone is either an extra choosing the best tools, or a hero working to earn their favour, in the ruling philosophy of techvolution.

Rest assured, the millions of the protagonists inside the open-source community will soon make a app far more powerful than my little thing. Darth Blockbuster can't stop it. The question is, now that the Sith are defeated, how do we empower you Jedi in the open-source community, to build the future faster.

I mean how do we empower ourselves to the Moon, Mars and beyond. Travelling the stars needs a new way of life. All us geeks have seen it, and wish to live in it, everytime we watch not a galaxy far far away, but the one with the continuing mission to explore strange new worlds with Captain Picard.

That's coming up in the sequel, the book I originally wrote, _Techvolution: Building Starfleet_.

### Personal Note on Political Philosophy, The Prince, and the Executive

This was the the executive. It will do for economics what the prince did for science and later on for politics. putting humans below the story, and letting the truth of the world as seen and sensed by tools, to determine our truths. human affairs, especially economic ones of what we make and use, needs the same transition as science, and democracy has today.

If it was called and presented that, you'd likely seen it through red and blue eyes. I hoped to showcase how the prince changed and belittled human thinking but that meant to empower it with science that has done more to improve humanity's progress than anything else in history.

I wish this book means humanity will never need another lesson. That's probably too idealistic. So hopefully this books will make it easier the next time human hubris gets in the way of heavenly progress.
