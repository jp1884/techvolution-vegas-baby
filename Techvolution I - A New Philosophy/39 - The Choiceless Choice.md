# King's Choice

Once peace and security returned to western Europe, the nobility's storyline ended. Thus, the nobility should have proactively done what Rousseau said, and return to being equal members of a peaceful, self-governing, democratic, society. They didn't of course. And history used many violent revolutions to right that wrong.

Charles had a speech impediment. Often called a stammer or studder. No one then, or even now, understands what causes it. It's like a gremlin holding an electrical cord connecting your thoughts and your tongue; sometimes the electricity flows, and sometimes it doesn't. In practice this means some words are easy to say, some are ~~difficult~~ hard, and some decide which at the last mili-mili-mili-second.

Talking with a stutter is like playing guitar, except the music notes are written on the fly by a drunk friend. The randomness of sayable, non sayable, and maybe sayable, rush toward the speaker in real time. Fail and you stutter. And far worst is getting  _that_ look from people when it happens, the "what the fuck is wrong with you?" look. Succeed and people hear the wonderful music of smooth talking.

Hello, my ~~name~~ I go by John-ne. I wa-want ~~can~~ want to help ~~master~~ human evol-ution. I've been ~~writ~~ trying to write this book for ~~about~~ ah ~~five~~ six months...

The prospect of talking, except to yourself and a dog, which Charles had two of, causes huge anxiety as you can imagine. _The King's Speech_ showed it well. The impediment usually forces a person to be shy, passive, eager to please, and come up with weired reasons for their erratic speaking like hand gestures, random silence, drinking, and swear words (which for some reason never cause a stutter). It's entirely possible King Charles' relationship with Parliament was so bad because he simply didn't want to talk with them. Not that he would ever admit he had a problem. After all, he was a king!

I know this all because luckily enough (kidding) I have the same affliction as King Charles. It was the reason I got a job in a car insurance claim department. After a Vice President at an old company secretly told my supervisor I wasn't allowed to talk to customers, for fear of embarrasing the company, I was like shit I guess I don't have this damn gremlin under control. I wasn't even that mad about it (although I was that they were not upfront). I never told anyone I had the impediment, so despite therapy as a kid, it was obviously still a problem.

So fuck it. Jump into the deep end and sink or swim. A car insurance claim call-centre was like the Olympic trials for a stutterer. So I jumped in and had a daily workout of huge emotional outbursts from customers, all day phone calls, customer service expectations, no "outs" like swear words, booze, or wonky behavior to hide behind.

And it was far worse then I thought. The insurance company would ring a monotone digital "bell" all day because... I don't know, to de-sensitize us to customers pleas for more money, or to bully us to hurry up maybe. Management used it as punishment; "answer more phone calls or we'll make the bell louder!". I'm being serious by the way. Back then, car adjusters were often more stressed then the person who just had a car crash.

Whatever the reason, DING-DING-DING-DING all day, which gave people who weren't stutterers huge anxiety, breakdowns, sick leaves; one guy had a frickin heart attack. Most days like the stock market crashed. Some calls were actually nice, some were horrible, most the time you and the caller just wanted to hurry up and go about your day.

Super-shock speech therapy! After about a year I didn't have to massage my jaws at night to release it from all the teeth shattering jaw-clenches I did to divert vocal stuttering. I was cured!

The point is this. That's what I took for me to mostly now, never really stutter (except for situations like boardrooms or anywhere else where pretenious cultures limit my word options.). It's like night and day. A hidden personality was brought out and frankly is fun, although still surreal, to be.

Yet Charles never had this lesson. He was famoulsy shy, quiet, and anxious his whole life because that's the personality the gremlin superimposes onto you. Even when fighting a 10 year war defending his "noble right" to govern England, Charles still probably had to massage his strained jaws every night. I can sympathize. The gremlin is a bully.

After he lost the civil war Charles was tried in court. He was accused of being "a Tyrant, A Traitor, Murderer, and a public enemy to the Commonwealth of England". The prosecutors said Charles didn't have a "divine right to rule" and asked for the death penalty. Charles wouldn't even acknowledge the charges, the trial, or his judges. His life was on an actual chopping block, and he just ignored the possibility of being guilty of anything.

Charles wasn't pretending or bluffing. He wasn't proud, or stubborn. He psychologically couldn't understand even the idea of being wrong. He was a noble. Noble's rule. God said so. Who is anyone to question God? Charles was an antagonist who thought he was the hero.

The judges convicted Charles anyway. He was sentenced to death by removing the head from the body. Charles was flabbergasted, and finally spoke in his defense. Fuck the ringing bell of a claims department, or the yelling customers, Charles only had words to save his life! Speak or die Charles. And... and... no stutter. Not once!

Charles freely, openely, spoke the music of his mind.

He didn't just speak, he spoke so eloquently many people, even those who hated him, were impressed. He spoke so well, so clearly, people heard no gremlin! Fuck... I'm happy for him. It must have felt like so much vindication. Like having lunch with your dream girl after years of thinking you could never ask her. Charles must have thought God killed the gremlin for him. Indeed Charles's last words were a clearly "I am the Martyr of the people."

Charles spoke clearly because he had no anxiety. He had no doubts. No questions. He was wrong, dead wrong. Pun intended. His and his peers ignorance caused so much destruction we've been studying it for centuries. Yet he still believed he was making society better. He died believing in it while speaking his last words without a hint of a stutter.

I can tell you how hard that was for him. Although I'd ~~still~~ have to jump a-around, ~~this~~ the ~~smaller~~ gremlin while I did. It's rare to be so, it's rare to be so con--fid happy, that the gremlin ~~runs~~ goes gone for good.

This story may seem dramatic. It's not. I'm using King Charles because he was among the first nobles to have the choice of leaving the throne. King George III of England had the same choice in 1776 when American coloials wanted representation inside their government. King Louis XVI of France had a similar choice in 1789 and choose to stay. He ironically helped design the guiliotine that would cut his head off. Tsar Nicholas II of Russia in 1917 had a similar choice. He left the throne, but not before bringing anarchy to Tsarist Russia that brought the communists to power who soon killed him and his family.

The nobles divine right to rule was a ruling philosophy. One of many in the grand story of life's fight against evil. The political nobles were at first the protagonist, and at the end, antagonist who went down fighting, instead of bearing the shame of returing to be equals members of the community, and starting a new story. The people, were enraged, so the people rose up, and started violent revolutions.

No tell me, will this happen again or not.
