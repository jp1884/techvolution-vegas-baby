### Declaration of the Rights of Man, and the Citizen
Article I – Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be founded only upon the general good.

Article II – The goal of any political association is the conservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man. These rights are liberty, property, safety and resistance against oppression.

Article III – The principle of any sovereignty resides essentially in the Nation. No body, no individual may exercise any authority which does not proceed directly from the nation.

Article IV – Liberty consists of doing anything which does not harm others: thus, the exercise of the natural rights of each man has only those borders which assure other members of the society the fruition of these same rights. These borders can be determined only by the law.

Article V – The law has the right to forbid only actions harmful to society. Anything which is not forbidden by the law cannot be impeded, and no one can be constrained to do what it does not order.

Article VI – The law is the expression of the general will. All the citizens have the right of contributing personally or through their representatives to its formation. It must be the same for all, either that it protects, or that it punishes. All the citizens, being equal in its eyes, are equally admissible to all public dignities, places, and employments, according to their capacity and without distinction other than that of their virtues and of their talents.

Article VII – No man can be accused, arrested nor detained but in the cases determined by the law, and according to the forms which it has prescribed. Those who solicit, dispatch, carry out or cause to be carried out arbitrary orders, must be punished; but any citizen called or seized under the terms of the law must obey at once; he renders himself culpable by resistance.

Article VIII – The law should establish only penalties that are strictly and evidently necessary, and no one can be punished but under a law established and promulgated before the offense and legally applied.

Article IX – Any man being presumed innocent until he is declared culpable if it is judged indispensable to arrest him, any rigor which would not be necessary for the securing of his person must be severely reprimanded by the law.

Article X – No one may be disquieted for his opinions, even religious ones, provided that their manifestation does not trouble the public order established by the law.

Article XI – The free communication of thoughts and of opinions is one of the most precious rights of man: any citizen thus may speak, write, print freely, except to respond to the abuse of this liberty, in the cases determined by the law.

Article XII – The guarantee of the rights of man and of the citizen necessitates a public force: this force is thus instituted for the advantage of all and not for the particular utility of those in whom it is trusted.

Article XIII – For the maintenance of the public force and for the expenditures of administration, a common contribution is indispensable; it must be equally distributed to all the citizens, according to their ability to pay.

Article XIV – Each citizen has the right to ascertain, by himself or through his representatives, the need for a public tax, to consent to it freely, to know the uses to which it is put, and of determining the proportion, basis, collection, and duration.

Article XV – The society has the right of requesting an account from any public agent of its administration.

Article XVI – Any society in which the guarantee of rights is not assured, nor the separation of powers determined, has no Constitution.

Article XVII – Property being an inviolable and sacred right, no one can be deprived of private usage, if it is not when the public necessity, legally noted, evidently requires it, and under the condition of a just and prior indemnity.

### Summary of Third Estate
The Third Estate had around 30,000 complaints and grievances to bring up during the Estates General in 1789. They wanted change but not for the whole French Society and did not expect this meeting of the estates to bring about a full-blown revolution1. The Third Estate refused to consent to the abolition of the sale of offices unless the nobles surrendered some of their privileges. They also spoke out mainly against the financial privileges held by the two other Estates. They were both exempt from most taxes such as the church tithe and the taille (the main direct tax). They also wanted to have a fair voting system in the Estates-General.

The Tennis Court Oath was a dramatic act of defiance by representatives of the nonprivileged classes of the French nation (the Third Estate) during the meeting of the Estates-General (traditional assembly) at the beginning of the French Revolution. The deputies of the Third Estate, realizing that in any attempt at reform they would be outvoted by the two privileged orders, the clergy and the nobility, had formed, on June 17, a National Assembly. Finding themselves locked out of their usual meeting hall at Versailles on June 20 and thinking that the king was forcing them to disband, they moved to a nearby indoor tennis court (salle du jeu de paume). There they took an oath never to separate until a written constitution had been established for France

## Our problems - Rates Up

What do you want from politics? If you want screaming, yelling, blame, and picking a group of people to fight. Go do that.

Politics doesn't exist to fight. It exists so a group of people, from several, to millions, can come together and problems. People only fight when they can't compromise. Before we talk about how to fix our politics, we must understand what our politics is trying to fix.

Here are a list of problem our society is facing today. These aren't Left or Right, but an extensive list of facts to give a picture on politics in America.

The United States has been running consistent trade deficits since 1976 due to high imports of oil and consumer products. In 1974 it was about -2 billion. By 1988 it was -10 billion. By 2000 it was -30 billion and by 2018 it was minus -60 billion. If America was a business, charity, or person, it would be bankrupt.

### Work

In the United States, the ratio of personal income saved has gone down. 1963-1975 it was 10-15% and then lowered under 5% 2009. It increased a little for the next decade, but by 2022 it was again under 5%.

The gap between productivity and a typical worker's compensation has increased dramatically since 1979 Productivity growth and hourly compensation growth, 1948-2022

Productivity-1948-1979 Productivity +117.5%. Compensation +107.3%.. Productivity +64.7% Hourly pay +14.8%. Productivity has grown 4.4x as much as pay. 

Fertility rate: children per woman. 1950 - 2.93.  1970 - 2.47. 2000 - 2.05. 2021 - 1.66. 

Marriages per 1,000 people. Number of marriages in each year per 1,000 people in the population. In 1970 it was 10.60 in USA. Since then the slide has been 6.50.

Stay-at-home parents in Canada.
The number of single-earner families with a stay-at-home parent dropped from 1,487,000 in 1976 to 493,000 in 2015. Families with a stay-at-home mother declined by 1,025,000, whereas those with a stay-at-home father increased by 32,000. The number of stay-at-home mothers declined in almost every year between 1976 and 2015. The majority of the decline occurred between 1976 and 1991 (851,000, compared with 174,000 between 1991 and 2015). 

**People aren't paid well despite being more productive. Not surprinsgly, people aren't having as many kids, aren't getting married as often, and both parents are increasing employed instead of someone concentrating on raising their kids.**

### Health

People have gotten unhealthier. For example, estimated prevalence of obesity which is a risk factor for chronic complications, including cardiovascular disease, and premature death. In 1975 11.70% were obese, by 2016 it was 37.30%

The amount of medical doctors has barely changed in that period. Staying between 2.2 to 2.7 per 1000 people between 1995 to 2020. Meanwhile nurses per 1000 people has gone from 10 in 2000 to 12 in 2020. Hospital Beds went down in the United States. There were 8.5 per 1000 people in 1968 to 4.5 in 1992 to 3 in 2016.

Roughly the same amount of doctors, more nurses, and less hopsital beds. 

USA - 1930 - 0.34% government healthcare expenditure as a share of GDP.
USA - 1960 - 1.09% government healthcare expenditure as a share of GDP.
USA - 1990 - 4.54% government healthcare expenditure as a share of GDP.
USA - 2020 - 15.95% government healthcare expenditure as a share of GDP.

So, if medical care wasn't getting this money, where was it all going?

Growth in the number of healthcare administrators has far outpaced growth in the number of physicians. Between 1975 and 2010, the number of U.S. physicians grew 150%, roughly proportional to population growth, whereas the number of healthcare administrators increased 3200%. Supporters of this exponential growth argue that increased administration is necessary to navigate changes in healthcare delivery, including advances in information technology, new regulatory requirements, and unprecedented levels of scrutiny. On the other hand, critics say administrator growth increases physician burnout. As administrators impose rules, management procedures, and regulations to streamline clinical processes and achieve the "triple aim" of healthcare, the burden often falls on physicians. 

### Prison

The year 2023 marks the 50th year since the U.S. prison population began its unprecedented surge. In 1972, the imprisonment rate was 93 per 100,000 people.11 The prison expansion that commenced in 1973 reached its peak in 2009, achieving a seven-fold increase over the intervening years. Between 1985 and 1995 alone, the total prison population grew an average of eight percent annually. And between 1990 and 1995, all states, with the exception of Maine, substantially increased their prison populations, from 13% in South Carolina to as high as 130% in Texas. The federal system grew 53% larger during this five-year period alone.

### Environment

Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Data. Global carbon emissions from fossil fuels have significantly increased since 1900. Since 1970, CO2 emissions have increased by about 90%, with emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes contributing about 78% of the total greenhouse gas emissions increase from 1970 to 2011. Agriculture, deforestation, and other land-use changes have been the second-largest contributors.

CO2 Emissions in World increased to 34344006.07 KT in 2019 from 34289350.66 KT in 2018. CO2 Emissions in World averaged 21959280.11 KT from 1960 until 2019, reaching an all time high of 34344006.07 KT in 2019 and a record low of 9423934.42 KT in 1961.

Carbon dioxide emissions account for the largest share of greenhouse gases which are associated with climate change and global warming. Data for carbon dioxide emissions include gases from the burning of fossil fuels and cement manufacture, but excludes emissions from land use such as deforestation. Oil releases about 50 percent more carbon dioxide than natural gas, and coal releases about twice as much. Carbon dioxide emissions are often calculated and reported as elemental carbon. The unit of measurement is kt (kiloton).

1968 - 14000000 KT
1980 - 20000000 KT
2004 - 27000000 KT
2016 - 33000000 KT

### Debt

People need money and so do governments. Debt is used by everyone to pay for things today...

National debt of the United States has been growing. In 2006 it was 8 trillion, 2016 18 trillion, and 2024 34 trillion.

Federal debt to revenue ratio The federal government has a 6.75 to 1 debt to revenue ratio as of Q2 2023.
1966 - 2.2
1976 - 2.0
1990 - 2.8
2004 - 3.5
2010 - 5.3
2020 - 6.1

The United States recorded a Government Debt to GDP of 129 percent of the country's Gross Domestic Product in 2022. Government Debt to GDP in the United States averaged 65.20 percent of GDP from 1940 until 2022, reaching an all time high of 129.00 percent of GDP in 2022 and a record low of 31.80 percent of GDP in 1981. source: Office of Management and Budget, The White House

1945 - 119%
1955 - 65%
1972 - 35%
1989 - 55%
2006 - 61%
2023 - 130%

Consumer and Government Debt as a % of GDP

1966 - 80%,
1980 - 75%,
1990 - 110%,
2000 - 105%,
2010 - 180%,
2019 - 175%,

---

All of these growing problems leads us to the expression of frustration. All governments, whether its an elected one or not, usually promises prosperity. Governments leaders act like parents, people with the authority but also the responsiblity to provide food, shelter, hopes and dreams to their followers.

Hence today's ragged political climate. When the National Election Study began asking about trust in American government in 1958, about three-quarters of Americans trusted the federal government to do the right thing. Trust in government began eroding during the 1960s, recovered in the mid-1980s, but falling again in the mid-1990s. Since 2007, the shares saying they can trust the government always or most of the time has not surpassed 30%.

People don't trust government as much because they feel government is negging on their deal to provide a happy life.

Today's politics will solve all these problems by blaming someone else. Far from being the solution, they point the finger. Hence it is widely reported that partisanship in the United States Congress is at an historic high. We quantify the level of cooperation between Democrat and Republican Party members in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1949-2012. We find that despite short-term fluctuations, partisanship in the U.S. Congress has been increasing exponentially since the 1970s with no sign of abating or reversing.

We want to solve these problems. Our political representatives, parties, ideologies are not solving problems. Before we talk the new ideas that is Techvolution, let's look at how Life solves problems. She's been doing it quite a bit longer.

<Flipper1970 />
 
## How Life Solves Problems

Whatever problems you have, Life has dealt with it before. Hunger, loneliness, thirst, cold, these are all constant problems for anything living on Earth. So while you think of your problems today, a penguin is diving for fish, an ant colony is raiding its neighbor, a polar bear is stalking a seal, and trillions more lifeforms are also battling for survival.

Living in the wild is tough, but many creatures struggle extra hard today. The environment is changing fast. Among other things, forests, greenfields, and ice caps are disappearing. That means lifeforms such as polar bears have increasingly unhelpful adaptations. They have Life's burning desire to survive and procreate, but their form of white coat and colossal bulk is losing its once mighty advantage to kill seals in the Arctic.

What options does the polar bear have?

Let's look at another creature that faced a similar problem. 

Earth is always changing. 2.3 million years ago it was changing especially fast in the space between North and South America. Central American was born after two tectonic plates smashed into each other. At the same time, the Pleistocene glaciation was spreading huge glaciers. Many animals near the polls needed to move. Happily, there was a new land bridge to give everyone a place to aim for a better life.

During this time the dull-colored bird flew out from South America into the Pacific ocean, likely blown out by storms and not showing an explorers spirit. Some birds eventually found salvation in a series of volcanic islands today called Galapagos. Like the polar bears today, these creatures were stuck in a totally new environment.

There are 18 major Galapagos islands. Each are different. Some are new volcanic islands similar to Hawaii. Lush and full of Life. Other islands are old and weathered down by the elements and look almost empty of Life.

But these islands are all the original birds had. So Life went to work.

Life can't assess her environment and available resources and create the traits she needs to survive. Instead, Life slightly changes the genes of new offspring during reproduction. Thus the single bird ventured out into the the many different islands. The birds with the right traits for a particular environment found enough resources to procreate and pass on their beneficial genes. The ones who struggled eventually died off, saving the finch population of its unhelpful traits.

The small birds famously evolved to have different beaks which are suited to different food types such as large seeds, small seeds, berries and insects. With no other birds around, these finches evolved to occupy all different niches in the ecosystem. With Life's evolution at is back, the small bird that landed on a new land, soon became different species, a staple of its many different ecosystems.

When Charles Darwin visted the Galapagos, observing these finches helped him unlock the story of evolution. When Darwin was born people thought God created all Life about 5,000 years ago.

The truth is, we weren't the first species to live on Earth, and we won't be the last. Life has survived billions of years without depending on any species. There's nothing special about any creature. We each survive and thrive according to the same laws of evolution.

Life needs evolution because the Universe is a hostile place. It's constantly changing as mountains fall apart, volcanoes erupt, stars emit radiation, waves wash away shorelines, and endless more things transform our planet. To respond to a changing environment, Life must evolve new species.

Creatures continue playing because their combination of attributes gives them an edge. But, as the planet inevitably changes, traits lose their advantage. Thus, while evolution is a constant race to harvest resources more efficiently, no species ever knows if its list of adaptions is good enough to overcome the problems of its environment. That's why pain hurts so much; it's Life's way of telling individuals to change their behavior and try something else before it's too late.

Evolution has these laws:

 - No species survives forever.
 - All lifeforms have a common ancestry.
 - Evolution of new species is gradual.
 - The number of species always multiplies to fill niches.
 - Natural selection determines which individuals lives on.

These laws describe the patterns and processes of evolution. The competition started after a few amino acids combined to form the first cells 3.6 billion years ago. Since then, evolution has continually created new species. Each is based on the prior one, but each removes or adds traits to find an edge. That edge could mean simple improvements like getting bigger or smaller, faster or slower. Or, the edge could be a specialization to find a niche no one else has, such as polar bears being the only seal hunters seals in a frozen ecosystem.

Regardless of what new adaptation an organism evolves, evolution's selection of the best adaptations requires daily and hourly scrutiny throughout the world of every adaptation, even the slightest. The best way to continually test species is with ecosystems. By putting creatures inside a shared environment, there are checks and balances to keep everyone able to harvest resources from the environment and each other. So when any plant, fungus, scavenger, predator, herbivore, or omnivore falls behind, Life can easily search the ecosystem and create a new species to take the laggard's place. Crucially, all lifeforms cooperate inside ecosystems to keep Life playing the game of survival.

_The Evolutionary Spiral in the [history of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_evolutionary_history_of_life). Evolution is seamless from Life's perspective._

The story of Life is billions of years old, involving trillions of lifeforms. Happily, the pages are very organized. Since Life adapts to its surroundings, we can track evolution using Earth's geological changes. Each period, epoch, and age of Earth's geography, from the Jurassic to the Paleozoic, have different characteristics like concentration of oxygen in the air, amount of water in the oceans, or ice in the poles. These geological changes are chapters in the story of Life.

While Life's evolution was relatively seamless between each chapter, species often had an agonizing time during the transition. Each time Earth's geology changed, it was like a climactic conclusion asking if an individual's list of adaptations would prosper in the new environment. The few creatures who passed the test climbed the ladder to the next age, while most species went around in circles, stubbornly fighting their inevitable extinction; their existence was only remembered as fossils to be maybe uncovered one day. 99% of all the species that have lived are dead.

![Evolutionary Spiral](/assets/speciation-elephants.png)
_The Evolutionary Spiral in the [history of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_evolutionary_history_of_life). From a lifeform perspective, evolution is a series of death circles._

It took scientists centuries to demystify the story of Life's evolution, and this summary misses the many details. But the essence is here: Life must adapt new species to Earth's ever-changing environment. The faster, the better; the more species, the better. Individual evolution suffers no interference because individuals are Life's unit of selection. Wherever there's liquid water, an artist named evolution works night and day, creating custom lifeforms to harvest every possible ray of sunshine, food scrap, and heat source. Evolutions's constant stream of creations is the only reason Earth isn't just another rock revolving around a star with no one to notice how beautiful the Universe is.

Because animals sadly can't change their genes. Like the polar bear now, all must endure the pain of "survival of the fittest" to evolve. We humans also evolved via the same laws of evolution. But once we invented technology, our evolution started to look a little different.

If you don't like politics, or you feel pressured to care because politics is suddenly everywhere, this book is for you. Despite the uproar on American television, radio, and dinner tables, you don't need to pick a side in the Left versus Right war.

You know when a salesman pitches something like an extended warranty. With a lousy product, he resorts to catchy words and false urgency to push for a sale. 

Our ideologues present themselves as being altruistic debaters, but the Right and Left are more like sales departments. They push everything from SUVs, corporate healthcare, and for-profit prisons on the Right. To EVs, government healthcare, and university education on the Left. Each side oversells the good parts, plays down the bad, uses catchphrases like "liberty" and "justice" to appeal to their customers, and creates an urgency that it's "use my products, or else the other side will ruin society."

Our politics is falling apart because the products of both sides are too old, ineffective, or expensive to help Americans live better lives. This book teaches a new kind of politics. One that uses modern technology to fix problems today so our kids, country, and planet have a better tomorrow.

## Inner Flap

_Here is where political philosophy enters. People often don't always reason well, but they do always look for a reason—and political philosophy starts from that fact. In America today, Progressives argue that wealth is unjustly distributed, for example, but they overlook the need to generate wealth. Conservatives do the reverse; preoccupied with wealth generation, they pay little attention to how it should be distributed._

_A partisan difference like this one is not a clash of "values," with each side blind to the other and with no way to decide between them. A competent judge could ask both sides why they omit what they do, and he could supply reasons even if the parties could not. Such a judge is on the way toward a new political philosophy._

Harvey C. Mansfield, _A Student's Guide to Political Philosophy_

---

Whole Foods shoppers want fair-trade coffee. Corvette collectors are ready to buy another model. Home and Garden Television viewers would love to renovate their home again.

Right and Left ideologues want to sell their chosen products. But they don't go out and say that because they have thousands of items in their catalog. The only way to sell each is to use philosophy. Because, like with brands, once a person buys into a philosophy, they will sell themselves the products of its unique way of thinking.

Political philosophy is a long and complicated road, but it's fair to say today that the Right believes in Conservative philosophy started by [Edmund Burke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Burke) in 1806. While, the Left believes in the Progressive philosophy that [John Stuart Mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill) wrote in 1859.

Both philosophies were invented in the early Industrial Age to help our very poor ancestors overcome everyone's extreme poverty. Conservativism empowered industrious people to concentrate the wealth needed to build the first railroads, mills, and factories. They cherished equity, profit, and consistency because these helped their mission to make new products. Progressivism let creative people imagine new products and marketing campaigns to keep industrialization growing. They cared about equality, change, and rights because they knew disadvantaged persons needed to benefit from industrialization to join in. Although they'd bicker, both sides could cooperate because they built and sold the first trains, pants, toilets, pens, disinfectants, and other innovative products.

Happily, after many years of advancements, we no longer have primitive factories, mills, transportation or mass hunger, illiteracy, and disease (if you're thinking about all the poor people in the world today, you are correct; their lives should be improved, but still marvel at the fact in the 1800s, almost all persons lived in poverty and there was no one to blame or send help because poverty-fighting tools didn't exist yet).

Many products and policies today are supported by the Left or Right. For example, government regulation, green energy, and university education are typically Left. At the same time, corporate policies, fossil fuels, and business-world experience are often Right. There are no legal limits on either side's choices, but if a product distributes money, Leftists will likely include it. If a product grows personal wealth, Conservatives will usually like it. Even so, plenty of rich Progressives are selfishly defending their money and charitable Conservatives distributing theirs. Regardless of contradictions, ideologues must protect their friends. While both sides will benefit from a product or policy it argues against, like all sales departments, they only promote the ones in their catalog.

Conservatives and Progressives fight so much today because their Industrial Age products are out of date and losing sales. They mock each other's failings for entertainment because that's the only way to maintain their own believers' loyalty and attract new buyers. Their sales pitches have devolved into "The Right is concentrating too much wealth!" or "The Left is distributing too much wealth!" to which the other side screams to its followers, "That's what we're supposed to be doing! Keep going! Don't them _them_ stop us!"

And both sides are correct.

If we were in the Industrial Age and trying desperately to keep factories from going broke or ending yet another cholera epidemic (both were common). But we're in the Internet Age with advanced robotics, supercomputers, clean energy, 5G internet, 3D printers, smartphones, AI, blockchain, and many more products that easily generate and distribute wealth. Yet, because we're using Conservativism and Progressivism to wield Internet Age tools, our current problem is too much wealth concentration (i.e., thousands of billionaires) and too much wealth distribution (i.e., printing money).

This book introduces Techvolution, a new philosophy combining Progressivism and Conservatism into an updated and improved package. Techvolution generates wealth easily and distributes it fairly by putting the incredible wealth-generating power of Internet Age technology into each person's hands.

Equity and equality all at once.

Conservative and Progressive have difficulty including new technology because it has elements of their enemy inside it. Only a new philosophy rises above their blind hatred so we can remind everyone that feeling hate for past sins and placing blame for our current troubles doesn't change our fate. We are creatures in nature, and as it does for all species, Life demands that we evolve new and improved adaptations to solve our problems.

We either innovate an Internet Age society proactively under the direction of Techvolution's new way of thinking or, after many depressions, wars, and revolutions, gradually teach us the lessons reason wasn't able to.

## Note to the Reader

To teach humanity about our evolution, Techvolution uses Aristotle's _Poetics_ to better understand Hegelian dialectics to showcase how humanity continues Life's Darwinian evolution via technological innovation. That's a mouthful, so it's easier to say this new philosophy explains why the politics inside our families, workplace, governments, and societies are best understood as another story in Life's long and ongoing evolution.

I wrote a deep dive in a book called _Story Cut Tools_, which is a good read but also long. This summary has enough meat so you can skip the nerdy philosophical details and jump into a new philosophy. It will put the power of evolution in your hands so you can evolve a new society today.

## Evolution

As you read this, a penguin is diving for fish, an ant colony is raiding its neighbor, a polar bear is stalking a seal, and trillions more lifeforms are battling for survival.

Living in the wild is tough, but many creatures struggle extra hard today. The environment is changing fast. Among other things, forests, greenfields, and ice caps are disappearing. That means lifeforms such as polar bears have increasingly unhelpful adaptations. They have Life's burning desire to survive and procreate, but their form of white coat and colossal bulk is losing its once mighty advantage to kill seals in the Arctic.

What would you tell a polar bear if you could communicate with her?

Wouldn't it be nice to explain Life on Earth is a game of survival, where organisms must adapt to changing environments to survive. Traits are the expressions of genes, which are passed on from parents to offspring during reproduction. Natural selection is the process by which organisms with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their winning traits to their offspring. Over time, natural selection leads to the evolution of new species that are better adapted to their environment.

Life needs evolution to survive a changing environment.

If we could educate a struggling polar bear about evolution, she would know her endangered place in the story of Life. She could then assess what innovations she needs to prosper in the Artic's new environment. Perhaps male polar bears should help raise their cubs. Or polar bears should hunt in packs to kill reindeer. Maybe the apex predator should go south and diversify her diet with berries, grubs, and roots.

Whatever new traits hungry polar bears will eventually need to have, if they knew about evolution, they could roll their own dice to find the adaptations that'll regain their prosperity. At least by understanding how evolution works, polar bears wouldn't feel so frustrated as they walk in circles, struggling to find seals in a wetter environment.

We can predict a rough future of polar bears because paleontologists, biologists, genealogists, and other specialists have mapped millions of species' habits, linages, and physiologies. This extensive knowledge lets scientists inform humanity about the history, status, and future of many creatures.

Here's a question: Do we know our fate like we know the polar bears? Given how much anger, angst, and confusion we have in our politics, the answer is no.

This book will teach you about human evolution. Our story is the same as all lifeforms. The environment is constantly changing. Thus, Life demands we innovate new adaptations to harvest the resources we need to keep procreating and evolving.

Humans think we understand Life's requirement to evolve. Almost every leader, company, and ideology says they'll provide enough resources for their people to live a happy Life. But all the marches, protests, strikes, fears of job losses, and other outbursts of frustration from society today show we don't know how to drop old ways of living and adopt the new adaptations we need to prosper. Indeed, most of today's Conservative vs. Progressive politics is about resisting evolution to keep an aging way of Life alive and then telling stories to justify why "the other" should bear the burden of society's refusal to stop being Industrial Age polar bears and start anew.

Techvolution will teach you how to move on from the past. You'll roll your own dice in the game of evolution and adopt the technological innovations that'll put the power of wealth-generating modern technology into your, and everyone else's, hands.

Because animals sadly can't change their genes. They must endure the pain of "survival of the fittest" to evolve. We can change our fate by updating our characteristics with modern technology. But before we use modern technology to regain our prosperity, we must use evolution to create a new politics. The recipe is straightforward: take one part Left and one part Right and mix them together.

<!-- ![Preface](/assets/problem-solving-philosophy.png) -->
<!-- Left and Right ideologies loves to "debate". But never do they concede a loss because they don't embrace evolution. In contrast try and find an innovative animal that spends time arguing with complacent ones. -->

## New Politics

>I thought you guys would like to hear this story. I know my fellow wrestlers know exactly what I'm talking about. A martial art is either real or it's not. Very early on in the sport of mixed-martial arts, when the logical assumption from the marketing team is that you're going to get every taekwondo student, every karate student, every judo practitioner, and every aikido and they're just going to absolutely love mixed-martial arts.

>It ended up being the absolute opposite.

>All of those arts that I just named that, turned out to not be real, or at least real in terms of their effectiveness in actual combat, steered as far away from mixed-martial arts as they could. They begged their students not to watch. Found a number of different reasons why mixed-martial arts is too violent or too, whatever their excuse was.

>Because the practioners of old martial arts didn't like what they were finding out. They had bought into it. They had spent their Life. They had mastered some of these old martial arts movements. To only find out that it was a waste of time.

In its highest form, politics discusses what direction a society should take. Individuals give their opinions, offer their perspectives, and exchange ideas. Should society invest in a new dock or a new road? Should we go to war or make peace? Should we attract newcomers or invest in citizens? Good politics is like a healthy nervous system directing resources to solve the pains of its society.

But daily politics isn't always so rational.

Cells in the human body are constantly fighting for resources, and we, the people who make up the ["body politic"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_politic) of our respective countries, are no different. Even in good times, daily politics is full of ranting, half-truths, and memes because individuals want tax breaks, subsidies, government bailouts, and other resources.

Why would anyone want to be left out?

Political philosophy is supposed to rise above daily politics and create a shared vision for a society. This super-narrative allows people to compete for resources while still trending everyone towards innovation. Only when a body politic works together can its members build a healthy nervous system that heals enough pains to keep evolution going. A good philosophy makes people realize humans are not the final judge of right or wrong. As it is for all creatures, Mother Nature ultimately decides if our way of Life is harvesting resources well enough to keep our civilization playing the game of evolution.

So, while many ignorant polar bears are doomed to suffer for many more years, with a good philosophy, humans can be happy and healthy in a constantly evolving society. As happened when young Conservatism and Progressivism together lifted humanity from poverty.

To evolve, we humans develop new traits. We try to change our "genes," so to speak. We train techniques to enhance our bodies. We change government policies to direct our resources in better ways. We open businesses to utilize goods and services differently. We invent tools to solve our problems with lasting solutions. And we learn new ideas to expand our minds.

Whatever traits we develop, we do it to solve our pains. 

Martial arts is a great example.

Karate, kickboxing, taekwondo, sambo, wrestling, aikido, jiu-jitsu, judo, and boxing are our most popular martial arts. Each teaches unique self-defense techniques like wrist locks or body punches. Each martial art creates rules that say only their techniques are allowed; there's no kicking in a boxing match, for example.

The world's martial arts co-existed for many years. Inside the disciplines, teachers happily taught their techniques to the next generation, practitioners would train almost every day, and the best students would compete in tournaments, get scholarships, and strive to become world champions. A discipline's rules, history, and ethics created a unique fighting philosophy that was kept lively by everyone congregating around experts, debates, and the latest news.

But these martial artists would only compete against each other.

However, in the late 1980s, as cable television and videotapes spread information worldwide, once-isolated fighting cultures started to open up. People got curious. As fighters began to watch other disciplines, they asked themselves, "Which martial art is best?"

Would a boxer beat a kickboxer? What about a wrestler versus a karate guy? Many people wanted to know what if martial artists threw away their rule books and fought a real fight.

In the early 1990s, the questions stopped, and the fighting started. At first, called Vale Tudo, then Ultimate Fighting, martial artists from every discipline competed in fights that excluded no techniques. Finally, the world's fighting masters could prove their martial art was the best on Earth!

And the winner of the best martial art was...

All of them are.

And none of them.

This revelation surprised everyone. The martial arts community assumed one discipline would reign supreme. But no discipline did because each had a limited toolbox of techniques. Sometimes, those techniques were very effective in a real fight, like Brazilian jiu-jitsu's submissions or wrestling's dominant control. But many techniques like karate's katas, taekwondo's flashy high kicks, and boxing's obsession with standing toe-to-toe and swinging for a knockout were easily countered and [therefore ineffective](https://youtube.com/shorts/4IjqBuo3Bow?feature=share).

As Ultimate Fighting tournaments continued, it became clear that some martial arts disciplines were more effective than others, but each had drawbacks, and none was complete. When Ultimate Fighting grew in popularity during the 1990s and 2000s, it forced all martial arts communities to reflect on their fighting techniques, styles, and philosophy.

As the opening quote says, many practitioners, coaches, and pundits (especially from the least effective disciplines) retreated into their sub-cultures because they "didn't like what they were finding out." I.e., they had bills to pay, and suddenly everyone could see their product was a self-defense philosophy with many useless techniques bundled inside.

Stubborn martial artists masked their problems by forming echo chambers. They pretended nothing had changed as their members told prospects and members about their glorious history, impressive morality, and superior fighting philosophy. It was all salesmanship to protect themselves from simple discussions about their technique's effectiveness against other options.

However, many fighters embraced the effectual truth revealed by Ultimate Fighting. As a result, the world of martial arts started to get all mixed up.

Kickboxers trained submissions. Wrestlers learned some punching. Masters in one discipline started as eager newbies in another. Like a bumblebee going from flower to flower, pioneering fighters like Bas Rutten, Maurice Smith, and Ken Shamrock cross-pollinated techniques from everywhere. They evolved more complete skill sets than any martial arts or discipline teacher.

These new martial artists discarded loyalty to a single discipline by opening their minds. They adopted evolution's philosophy of "adapt or die." Old disciplines, school-like systems of grades, belts, trophies, medals, and scholarships became stepping stones to building a complete skillset and not end goals to be relished. A fighter's physical pain was the new barometer of whether a technique or teacher was good or bad.

Finally, human self-defense learned what every lifeform on Earth knows: loyalty to man-made philosophies will not save you in Nature.

No deer in the world depends on a judge to save it when fleeing a bear, as no bear depends on a pundit declaring it the winner to get its next meal. Just like in Nature, the best martial art technique is entirely dependent on one's opponent and surroundings while measuring the risks and rewards of the fight.

Fighters weren't stupid despite being misled by judges, pundits, and teachers of ineffective martial arts. Their fault was quite human; they fell prey to good storytelling. 

Quality storytelling is why so many devoted boxers, judokas, and other practitioners were sucked in by their respective fighting disciplines. Filled with history, culture, and traditions, isolated martial arts each had a philosophy so complete that it sold people into thinking it was the single source of truth.

During the growth of Ultimate Fighting, most fighters quickly realized the rules of boxing, kickboxing, wrestling, etc., let practitioners hone their chosen techniques. But the rules were artificial and must be forgotten when training for real fights.

After fighters embraced all disciplines, they entered a brave new world.

A world of remarkable progress, collaboration, and democratization. With an open mind, video cameras, and the internet, fighters created a wealth of training videos and distributed them worldwide. With accessible education, fighters unbundle martial arts disciplines into their individual techniques and create a blossoming ecosystem. Each fighter ventured out to improve themselves every day. Kickboxers learned some wrestlers, Jiu-jitsu black belts learned low-kicks. Each martial art became a sub-discipline that brought its techniques to an open marketplace of ideas.

The martial arts community was put on notice that echo chambers are for losers.

With evolution as their teacher, these new martial artists found the best mixture of techniques, trainers, and disciplines. The speed of victories and the less pain suffered in winning them was the best judge, teacher, and pundit of martial arts techniques. The top trainers helped fighters adapt better techniques faster.

When fighters finally embraced evolution, they created a new way for humans to think of self-defense called mixed-martial arts.

In mixed-martial arts, everyone, from fighters to trainers, pundits to fans, veterans to newbies, is accountable to evolution. Thus, fighters don't limit themselves within the confines of a single discipline. Every martial art has something to offer, so every person should be a bumblebee going from flower to flower, learning from each discipline. The best technique is the one that brings results. Evolution is so admired by mixed-martial artists that everybody is supposed to give their opinions, offer their perspectives, and exchange ideas because "iron sharpens iron."

Mixing the human body's adaptability with a free mind created a new, self-correcting, sustainable martial art. Today, a skilled mixed-martial artist is an overwhelming favorite against a champion of any fighting discipline. Just as important, since mixed-martial arts includes all techniques, any person, whether short or tall, heavy or thin, aggressive or meek, can "mix-and-match" techniques to find their niche and learn to win a fight. 

And finding a niche is what evolution is all about. By empowering anyone and everyone, mixed-martial arts is the ultimate fighting philosophy.

On our journey to improve our politics, here are the lessons we should take from the story of mixed-martial arts.

Today, in the early 21st century, the middle class suffers systemic problems. Taxes get more confusing. School prepares students less for the job market. Insurance gets more expensive. And there are many more pains in our society trending poorly.

Looking at our rising bills and shrinking savings accounts, we feel beat up. And, so, we look around for help.

Many people sell ideological politics on television, social media, and backyard barbeques. They get our attention because ideologues insist their techniques and tools improve the economy. As the economy gets more uncertain, the more sales these ideologues close. As a result, many people think being "political" requires supporting a single ideology of "red," "blue," "green," and so on. These new ideological converts buy books, follow pundits, go to rallies, and have a "good" or "bad" label for every tool and technique like solar panels, electric vehicles, government welfare programs, and...

Regular people keep getting our asses kicked in our real lives.

Because we think politics means supporting _one_ ideology and wrongfully think our government, paychecks, and happiness are governed by its rulebook.

Today's ideological teachers, pundits, and commentators are not philosophers pondering how best to relieve the pains of our entire body politic. They are salesman pushing their bundled techniques and tools before knowing what fight we're each in.

<!-- ![Ant Death Spiral](/assets/problem-solving-philosophy.png) -->
_Ant Death Spiral. Image Needed._

Thus, our ideologues are in a sort of death spiral. Whether "red," "blue," "orange," or "green," they are going in circles trying to make their Industrial Age techniques improve the economy single-handedly. They keep failing for the same reason no single martial art discipline can be the single source of truth. Problems don't adapt to solutions. As the polar bears are finding out, lifeforms must evolve to overcome problems.

As of now, we listen to ideological salesman contort our worldview with simple observations that justify their sales pitch. If people quit their jobs en masse, they _all_ must be lazy, assumes Conservative commentators on cable news. Or if lots of people rob stores, they _all_ must be hungry, say Progressive bloggers on social media. As bad managers lose workers, criminals run amok, and other symptoms get worse, ideological commentators, pundits, and supporters retreat into their echo chambers because "they don't like what they're finding out."

That's why I wrote _Techvolution_. It helps break any steadfast loyalty to one ideology and encourages everyone to realize we're a lifeforms in Nature. We should only be loyal to the rules, techniques, and tools that solve real-life problems. Because Nature is a street fight for polar bears, martial artists, and you.

If we could teach evolution to polar bears, they'd start adapting to their new environment. When fighters did embrace evolution, they improved their powers very quickly. When we welcome evolution in our politics, our body politic will have the freedom of mind to mix-and-match tools and techniques to overcome any economic problem. Be it dreadfully unproductive jobs, worsening climate change, or debilitating government bureaucracy. And when someone is confronting failure they will be empowered to evolve instead of making excuses.

You could describe Techvolution as mixed-ideological politics.

Like all the amazing martial arts techniques that only came together because of mixed-martial arts, it'll take mixed-ideological politics to shift through all the options of AI, apps, green energy, and so on down the Internet Age list of creations to solve the problems inflaming our politics with blame instead of problem-solving.

First though we must escaping the death spiral of today's ideological echo chambers. If we don't we'll easily get swept into the Left and Right war. It won't be easy. The constant storytelling of Twitter feeds, cable news, and dinner table arguments is engrossing. To see through ideological salesmanship requires a solid understanding of storytelling. Once you get that, you'll avoid being sucked into the false security of ideological echo chambers.

Once you're protected from political storytelling, you'll have the freedom of mind to use any Internet Age tool and technique. After you've found your niche, you'll be as powerful in your politics as a mixed-martial artist is in a street fight.

<!-- ![Bills Bills Bills]() -->
_As a member of the body politic, your pain determines what techniques and tools are good or bad. Holding back another's evolution is never good because "iron sharpens iron."_

## We Need Chambers, Just Not Echo Chambers

Before we learn to protect ourselves from today's Industrial Age ideological echo chambers, it's important to remember that we're not erasing ideologies. We're only becoming like mixed-martial artists, so we can mix-and-match policies, techniques, and tools to solve our everyday pains.

That means we must not judge tools by their ideological cover. Gas SUVs are sometimes needed, but sometimes EVs are too. Occasionally, we do need to raise taxes. But sometimes we need to cut them. GMO food can be harmful, but there are pluses, too. What tool or technique we choose depends on the pain, risks, and rewards of using a particular solution.

Some may doubt that our society can follow martial arts and embrace mixed-ideological politics. We can. Here's another field with a similarly enlightened mix-and-match philosophy.

Modern medicine has many disciplines and specialists. Some are based on cutting-edge research, others on old-school remedies. In the past, when isolated by geography and culture, patients were bound to do what the local healer or doctor prescribed. But today, you would never go to one medical professional, expecting them to be a master of every health problem.

There are too many illnesses and injuries for any medical discipline to master them all.

That's why all medical professionals today, from homeopathic healers to neural surgeons, are recognized as sub-disciplines. Each has its own tools and techniques, rulebooks, and culture. Still, medical professionals from each field can say their strengths and weaknesses and admit they are a niche rather than the single source of truth. The patient is like a bumblebee searching for better solutions, and the philosophy of modern healthcare is mixing disciplines to solve their pain as quickly as possible. While modern medicine certainly isn't perfect (especially its administration), it's nearly magical compared to when surgeons didn't sanitize their scalpels and doctors used one-size-fits-all solutions like leeches.

Most importantly, we understand medical professionals can be corrupt. If a doctor over-prescribes medication or sells "snake oil," we know the doctor isn't following evidence-based medicine and, therefore, has illegitimate authority to diagnose and solve problems.

Modern medicine and mixed-martial arts thus embrace evolution. Both medical and mixed-martial arts recognize that it is best to select from an ecosystem of options and that solving a fighter's or patient's pain is the only sign of success. Other human endeavors are also enlightened enough to embrace real-world results as superior to a teacher or boss's authority. [Baseball, for example, did it with Moneyball fame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MjxoaynCmk).

So, if a person can train techniques from multiple martial arts disciplines. And doctors can refer their patients to specialists from other disciplines. Why can't our politics also be self-aware and mix-and-match different policies, tools, and techniques according to their strengths and weaknesses in solving your unique economic problems?

<!-- ![Picture of a cell]() -->
<!-- _The autonomic nervous system heals our bodies. We only know something is wrong when we feel pain._ -->

To enlighten our politics in such a way, we only have to accept no ideology is complete. Like in medicine or Ultimate Fighting, any technique or tool must _not_ be evaluated on its ideological purity but based on evidence of its real-world results in reducing hunger, thirst, cold, depression, anxiety, and the other pains Life gives us so we change our ways before its too late.

Ideologues from everywhere on the political spectrum will (eventually) learn they don't need to take themselves so seriously, burden themselves so much, or sell their services so aggressively. Like a boxing coach or speech pathologist, each can improve their chosen techniques and tools and let people come to them as needed.

But for now, the biggest obstacle to mixed-ideological politics is the same as it was for mixed-martial arts. Ideological pundits, teachers, and commentators don't realize the value of a mix-and-match philosophy, so they tell great stories about why their beliefs, techniques, and rulebooks are the single source of truth inside echo chambers. To use mixed-ideological politics to find the niche of Internet Age tools you need to live a better Life, we must escape the spell of ideological echo chambers by understanding why we buy into great stories so easily.

<!-- ![Daily pains]() -->
_We monitor Industrial Age industrialization statistics like housing starts, car purchases, and college enrollment. We don't yet monitor daily pains such as mortgages not yet paid off, parents going to food banks, avoidable car crashes, and similar symptoms of a sick body politic.

## Cinderella

The classic fairytale _Cinderella_ knows how to hook an audience.

The movie tells the story of a pretty, diligent, and kind-hearted country girl named Cinderella. An unloved orphan, she lives with her wicked stepmother and two spoiled stepsisters. Jealous of her beauty, Cinderella's step-family antagonizes her ambitions, belittles her abilities, and forces her to do all the house chores. With only the local animals for companionship, the lonely teenager dreams of a better life and a chance to find happiness.

One day, Cinderella discovers the King is hosting an extravagant ball to find a bride for his charming son. Filled with excitement, Cinderella's friends help her sew a dress for what's sure to be the most wonderful night of her life.

But, just before departing for the party, her evil family forbids her, mocks her uppitiness, tears her dress to shreds, and leaves the young orphan home alone in tears.

Thankfully, just as despair is about to set in, Cinderella's Fairy Godmother appears. With a flick of her wand, the godmother transforms Cinderella's ragged clothes into a dazzling gown and sparkling glass slippers. The godmother also creates a carriage and a team of horses so her mistreated goddaughter will go to the ball in royal style.

At the party, Cinderella captivates everyone, especially the prince, with her beauty and grace. The two glide across the floor and whisper sweet nothings in each other's ears. Sadly, the spell that gave Cinderella her dress and entourage ends. The shy orphan flees the ballroom, leaving the prince only a glass slipper to remember her by.

The heartbroken young man is determined to find his true love and orders his men to search the kingdom for the girl who fits the glass slipper.

They eventually get to Cinderella's house. The wicked stepmother has gotten wise that her stepdaughter is the prince's heartthrob and locks her stepdaughter in the attic. Cinderella's friends come to the rescue, steal the key, and open the attic door. Cinderella can now ask the prince's men if she can try on the glass slipper. Just as she's about to, the evil stepmother smashes the precious memento.

To which Cinderella responds by revealing she has the other slipper.

And the rest is history.

The movie _Cinderella_ was very popular when it was released. It's popular today. And it'll be popular hundreds of years from now when humanity is (hopefully) traveling the stars. People will always like the story because everyone can cheer for a warm-hearted person overcoming bullies to improve her life.

People love stories. We can't get enough of them. A good story lets us experience the trials of another person. From horrible tragedies to whimsical romances, stories teach us the lessons of many lives.

Stories pass on so much information because they create a new reality. The creation process starts with the props that fill the storyworld with cups, clothes, homes, and the other items we expect to see in the environment. Next, there is music that relays the characters' emotions during critical events. Next comes the dialogue, which communicates what each character wants in an easy-to-understand way. Next, there is the villain who likes the world the way it is and defends it against change. After that comes the philosophy of the storyworld that dictates the rules everyone in the story is supposed to live by; for example, Cinderella is supposed to obey her stepmother. Cinderella is the story's hero because she disregards the ruling philosophy by fighting for a better Life. At the top of this story pyramid are tools, a catchall term for the objects, from glass slippers to Death Stars, that are above regular props because they are the levers of power that control what happens in the story.

Storytellers work hard to mix these ingredients together. When done correctly, the resulting "cake" will transfix audiences and raise strong emotions and lasting commitments because we've experienced the Life of another person inside an easy-to-digest package.

---

And that brings us back to avoiding echo chambers and practicing mixed-ideological politics.

Dismantling echo chambers starts by realizing _Cinderella_ isn't about a girl abused by her evil step-family. The fairytale is not about a girl overcoming her evil step-family to marry her prince charming.

The story of _Cinderella_ is about a girl overcoming her antagonistic step-family using levers of power, i.e., tools.

If Cinderella doesn't get the horses, carriage, and evening dress from her Fairy Godmother, she'll never get into the ball. The prince would only find her if he found her lost slipper. If the imprisoned girl's allies didn't steal the key to the attic, she'd never get out in time. And if Cinderella didn't have the second glass slipper, her name would be famous as a tragedy instead of a fairytale.

Cinderella had a problem. It wasn't that her step-family were tyrants or that the rules of society were unjust. Cinderella's problem was that her terrible step-family controlled the tools Cinderella needed to improve her Life.

From _Star Wars_, to _The Matrix_, to _Cinderella_ all stories start with a group of people controlling the tools while creating a ruling philosophy to explain their control. The hero encounters a problem and reaches for a tool to solve it. Antagonists reveal themselves by preventing access to defend their power base. The drama is about heroes and villains battling to control the tools required to change the world. The winner changes or reaffirms the world in their image.

Notice the ruling philosophy is two-sided: actual and public. When the stepmother rips Cinderella's gown, locks her in the attic, and destroys the slipper, she's using tools to alter the world to her benefit and letting us see her actual philosophy of oppression in her heart.

Yet, the stepmother would not admit her abuse. She'd tell the public, and likely herself, that Cinderella is loved and cared for. If asked why her stepdaughter is working so hard or absent from the ball, the stepmother would tell a story to justify her actions.

The truth is the stepmother favored her daughters and thus didn't want Cinderella to compete with them. Like old martial arts teachers, she couldn't admit that, so she said one thing while doing another. Cinderella wore a mask of oppression when she listened, complained, and argued about her stepmother's commands. Only when Cinderella decided to control the tools that controlled her fate did she better herself.

![Masked and antagonsit](/assets/problem-solving-philosophy.png)
_Masks of oppression often become the face we wear._

If a doctor insists on an ineffective treatment or a martial arts coach advises a bad technique, they are corrupt. The stepmother was crooked for the same reason. Authority is only valid when it empowers its follower's traits. Why would Life give authority that harmed its own evolution?

That's why, like all heroes, Cinderella's dreams only come true when she grabs the tools that solve her pains.

Another lesson from stories is that the hero and villain are no longer the main characters once the story ends. We don't need to hear from Cinderella after she marries the prince because "they lived happily ever after." As for the stepmother, she has no more tools to attack Cinderella and is thus no longer a threat worthy of attention.

Tools being levers of power, how we use our tools being our actual philosophy, and main characters having a limited shelf-life, are the facts those who sell themselves, their ideology, and their tools as being the eternal single source of truth that will solve all your problems, don't like.

## Conclusions Bring Mixed-Ideological Politics

Despite the emotions over gender pronouns, what name to call Christmas, and other culture war content, today's fiery politics is about resources. Because, at the end of the day, people are not ideologies. They are biological beings that need food, water, and shelter and, therefore, have bills to pay, and thus need someone to buy the techniques and tools they know how to use.

As the Industrial Age tools and techniques get older and less useful, each ideologue is forced to protect themselves from competition inside echo chambers. So, there are increasingly bullshit public philosophies in our politics. For example, Conservatives' inclusion of oil-based tools means they must deny climate change could possibly be man-made. Progressives' incorporation of massive government welfare programs means they must deny when these programs waste boatloads of money. Despite each side's sales pitches filled with phrases like social justice and personal liberty, each side only wants to close a sale on their tools.

The giveaway is the lack of conclusions.

Echo chambers don't like conclusions because they force reflection on whether a tool changed the world or not. For example, if a fighter gets choked unconscious in a mixed-martial arts fight, he must reflect on his tactics like Cinderella did after her dress was torn to shreds.

When curious fighters said, "What discipline is best?" and engaged in real fights and listened to their pains, they finally realized no discipline can be the single source of truth.

Belief in a mix-and-match philosophy turns people into heroes. Because tools shouldn't be clumped together into good or evil. They are inanimate. Like the glass slippers, they only hold value if they can help solve a problem. And that's what makes a hero, someone setting out to solve _their_ unique pains.

To escape echo chambers, embrace Techvolution and its mixed-ideological politics. Only then will you find your niche. All you need to do is understand when a mixed-martial artist enters a boxing gym, he's not being disloyal to his wrestling coach. When a family doctor refers you to a physiotherapist, she's not being unfaithful to medical doctors. When a biologist says, "I don't know, ask a neuroscientist," she's not being a bad biologist. This is because these fields understand they are sub-disciplines that exist to help a person solve a problem.

Fighters overcome opponents. Patients battle diseases. Cinderella had an evil stepfamily.

What's your problem?

- Is your job not paying enough? You will not be a disloyal Conservative because you joined a union.
- Are welfare programs administrators wasting bundles of money? You will not be a disloyal Progressive for exposing them.
- Is a lousy supply chain increasing your costs? You will not be a disloyal Progressive or Conservative for wanting a robust local supply chain.

You will not be disloyal because you are not Conservative or Progressive. You're a lifeform looking for resources; it's not your job to judge good and bad techniques and tools based on ideology. It's your job to solve your daily pains. And if any stepmother insults, bullies, threatens, or attacks your choice, let them innovate a better one.

You should use mixed-ideological politics to choose any tool. Not only because evolution has proven so successful in modern medicine and mixed-martial arts but also because selecting the best adaptation is the only way to win the never-ending game of evolution.

## There is No Lion King

We weren't the first species to live on Earth, and we won't be the last. Life has survived billions of years without depending on any species. There's nothing special about any creature. We each survive and thrive according to the same laws of evolution.

Life needs evolution because the Universe is a hostile place. It's constantly changing as mountains fall apart, volcanoes erupt, stars emit radiation, waves wash away shorelines, and endless more things transform our planet. To respond to a changing environment, Life must evolve new species.

Creatures continue playing because their combination of attributes gives them an edge. But, as the planet inevitably changes, traits lose their advantage. Thus, while evolution is a constant race to harvest resources more efficiently, no species ever knows if its list of adaptions is good enough to overcome the problems of its environment. That's why pain hurts so much; it's Life's way of telling individuals to change their behavior and try something else before it's too late.

Evolution has these laws:

 - No species survives forever.
 - All lifeforms have a common ancestry.
 - Evolution of new species is gradual.
 - The number of species always multiplies to fill niches.
 - Natural selection determines which individuals lives on.

These laws describe the patterns and processes of evolution. The competition started after a few amino acids combined to form the first cells 3.6 billion years ago. Since then, evolution has continually created new species. Each is based on the prior one, but each removes or adds traits to find an edge. That edge could mean simple improvements like getting bigger or smaller, faster or slower. Or, the edge could be a specialization to find a niche no one else has, such as polar bears being the only seal hunters seals in a frozen ecosystem.

Regardless of what new adaptation an organism evolves, evolution's selection of the best adaptations requires daily and hourly scrutiny throughout the world of every adaptation, even the slightest. The best way to continually test species is with ecosystems. By putting creatures inside a shared environment, there are checks and balances to keep everyone able to harvest resources from the environment and each other. So when any plant, fungus, scavenger, predator, herbivore, or omnivore falls behind, Life can easily search the ecosystem and create a new species to take the laggard's place. Crucially, all lifeforms cooperate inside ecosystems to keep Life playing the game of survival.

![Elephant Speciation](/assets/speciation-elephants.png)
_Here's one example of how a species evolves._

The story of Life is billions of years old, involving trillions of lifeforms. Happily, the pages are very organized. Since Life adapts to its surroundings, we can track evolution using Earth's geological changes. Each period, epoch, and age of Earth's geography, from the Jurassic to the Paleozoic, have different characteristics like concentration of oxygen in the air, amount of water in the oceans, or ice in the poles. These geological changes are chapters in the story of Life.

While Life's evolution was relatively seamless between each chapter, species often had an agonizing time during the transition. Each time Earth's geology changed, it was like a climactic conclusion asking if an individual's list of adaptations would prosper in the new environment. The few creatures who passed the test climbed the ladder to the next age, while most species went around in circles, stubbornly fighting their inevitable extinction; their existence was only remembered as fossils to be maybe uncovered one day. 99% of all the species that have lived are dead.

![Evolutionary Spiral](/assets/speciation-elephants.png)
_The Evolutionary Spiral in the [history of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_evolutionary_history_of_life). Evolution is seamless from Life's perspective. But there are often tragic endings for lifeforms who walk around in death circles._

It took scientists centuries to demystify the story of Life's evolution, and this summary misses the many details. But the essence is here: Life must adapt new species to Earth's ever-changing environment. The faster, the better; the more species, the better. Individual evolution suffers no interference because individuals are Life's unit of selection. Wherever there's liquid water, an artist named evolution works night and day, creating custom lifeforms to harvest every possible ray of sunshine, food scrap, and heat source. Evolutions's constant stream of creations is the only reason Earth isn't just another rock revolving around a star with no one to notice how beautiful the Universe is.

And now, we understand why echo chambers are doomed. They presume an adaptation can be ever-lasting. They commit themselves to a few techniques and tools on the Tree of Life and antagonize the creation of new ones by telling stories of their adaptation's supposed perfection. They try to remove the individual as the unit of selection by telling stores why Cinderella should stay in the attic.

Life, of course, doesn't care what stories we tell ourselves. Leaving those inside echo chambers to reconcile the ideology they passionately believe in against the pain they feel walking in circles, finding someone to blame because their aging adaptations can't harvest enough resources to make their users happy and healthy.

As it's always been, evolution is our way out. Unfettered innovation explains why modern medicine, mixed-martial arts, and fairytale characters like Cinderella are so successful. They drop unhelpful tools and pick up useful ones as needed. Their freedom of mind lets them reflect on their progress and make changes before it's too late.

For us to master evolution and use its incredible power, there is one crucial difference to always remember. Humans do not evolve. Technology does.

<!--  -->
_Today's politics is so angry because we don't have the philosophy to tell us to drop the old and pick up the new. We are all polar bears._

## Human Biology is Out, Technology is In

The Boston Symphony had a problem. No one knew why their orchestra had so many men. Plenty of talented female musicians challenged males for orchestra seats, yet women weren't making the cut. The auditions were already blind, so the symphony tried another technique to fix their problem. They asked musicians to take off their shoes before auditioning.

Voilà! The orchestra had even girls and guys once the shoes stopped giving away the musician's identity. Evolution gave a standing ovation because anything that gets in the way of the best solution, like gender, is all noise.

Finding the perfect biological adaptation takes a long time. Since organic lifeforms are physically attached to their adaptations, genetic mutations take millions of years to create new species. But while biological evolution is slow, at least it's inevitable. Genetic mutations happen involuntarily during procreation, so biological innovation is automatic with no interference possible.

There are no stepmothers in the biological evolution of Life.

We humans can't evolve biologically. If we did, then there might be a difference between male and female musicians. But our genes don't change when learning an adaptation like a violin or piano. Instead, we adapt our psychology to incorporate a new tool into our list of traits.

Most anyone with enough patience can learn any tool and evolve their skillset.

We are still biological lifeforms, but because we invent new tools, we facilitate Life's evolution with technology instead of biology. There is effectively no difference. Life wants adaptations that consistently collect energy, adapt, and procreate. Life doesn't care about the material composition any more than a composer or audience cares about what gender the orchestra is.

Our technological evolution follows the same laws as regular evolution.

 - No technology survives forever.
 - All technology has a common ancestry.
 - Evolution of new tools is gradual.
 - The number of tools continually diversifies to fill niches.
 - Natural selection determines which individual tools/users live on.
 
Thus, we humans are biological vessels for technological evolution. As Cinderella demonstrated, our fate is determined by the tools in our hands, not the genes in our cells.

Our evolution requires innovators to undertake the burden of inventing tools that effectively become a new species once someone uses them. Teaching a new tool requires lots of information, which is best communicated with a story. Therefore, innovation requires storytelling inside marketing and ideology to connect person and tool.

This happened during the creation of judo, boxing, wrestling, and other martial arts. While these disciplines have little technology, they still use bags, pads, ropes, gloves, weights, books, and videos to train, learn, and pass on knowledge.

These martial arts used the human body as a foundation to attach various techniques and tools. These distinct traits created species like boxers, judokas, kickboxers, etc.

![Technological Tree of Life](/assets/speciation-elephants.png)
_We live on the technological tree of Life. We live on the same evolutionary tree as biology but only operate technology._

Once home televisions and the internet allowed lots of information to flow, it became possible to do what evolution does: review the species, evaluate their strengths and weaknesses, and pick the best ones to solve a problem.

But, while the natural selection of biological Life is automatic, it is not for technological Life. For fighters to mix-and-match the best martial arts techniques required seeing through the stories that connected them to a single self-defense discipline. And seeing through stories isn't our best feature.

Why?

Because seeing through a story that connects us to a tool, we're doing what Cinderella did and confronting a power structure that typically responds with a self-serving, anti-evolution story.

_"Cinderella, the ball isn't for you."_
_"Cinderella, clean up; that is your job because you're the stepdaughter."_
_"Cinderella, you can't try on the glass slipper because I'm the mother, and I say only my daughters can be a princess."_
_"Cinderella, your pain is invalid; do what you're told to do."_

We can't understand a word of an oak tree, dolphin, or any other creature's communication. Yet, we understand all creatures' evolution by observing their actions. Because we can understand human language, the natural selection of tools is a mess. Innovators tell stories about how their magical new tools will solve real-life pains. While stepmothers pollute minds with fake stories like racism, sexism, elitism, and other bullshit to hide the fact evolution has toppled the technological power structure that gave them their edge.

Today, our society's huge Industrial Age ideological echo chambers exist to combat evolution.

And they won't stop fighting because, like it did with biological lifeforms so many times before, evolution has entered a new chapter in the story of Life. This one is called the Internet Age.

## Old Age, Ladder Climb, Final Frontier

In 55 BC, the Roman general Julius Caesar had a problem. His prosperous territory kept getting raided by Germans living across the Rhine River. Caesar defeated the raiders in battle, but that's why the Germans avoided fighting him. Instead, the barbarians used small boats to raid Roman villages at night.

So, to protect his society, Caesar had to defeat an enemy that wouldn't fight him.

He came up with an idea. The Germans were a tribal people with no written language, limited metalworking, and primitive engineering. Meanwhile, the Romans built excellent roads, long aqueducts, giant amphitheaters, and seemingly whatever else they wanted.

To showcase their technological power, Caesar decided to build a bridge.

The construction was carried out in an area where the river's depth would be up to nine meters. The bridge was built on double wooden piles driven into the riverbed by winching up a large stone and releasing it, thereby driving the posts into the riverbed. The construction system ensured that the greater the water flow, the harder the bridge was held together. Caesar's soldiers built the bridge in just 10 days.

Watching the Roman legions crossing the mighty Rhine River mystified the Germans.

The barbarians couldn't understand what the heck this "thing" was that let people walk on water. It would be like us today, watching people fly to the Moon on a couch. We'd be confused (to say the least) because human psychology needs to learn a technology [before we can comfortably use it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZcOKhYI57Y)

Caesar defeated the Germans by educating them about technological evolution. He showcased Roman mastery of the Classic Age and Germans being hundreds of years behind in the Iron Age. So impressed by Rome's levers of almost magical powers, the Germans made peace for generations.

Biological evolution is tracked in eras like the famous Jurassic period. For humans, the chapters of evolution are the ages of new technology. The tools we create, use, and understand determine where we are in the story of Life. Here is a list of all the technological ages and the civilizations that led humanity to each.

  - Bronze Age:     2000 - 1250 (Babylon)
  - Iron Age:       1250 - 550  (Greece)
  - Classic Age:    550 - 476   (Rome)
  - Middle Ages:    500 - 1439  (Abbasid)
  - Renaissance:    1440 - 1686 (Italy)
  - Science Age:    1687 - 1759 (France)
  - Industrial Age: 1760 - 1969 (America)
  - Internet Age:   1970 -      (TBD)
*** This list is Mediterranean-centric. Read "Guns, Germs, and Steel" to learn why. Remember, there are many more years ahead of us than behind us.

As Julius Caesar demonstrated, the difference between technological ages is enormous. A fundamental new technology is an entirely new stage of evolution, with a totally different list of traits in the hands of its people. There is no biological difference between peoples of different ages, but their levers of power certainly are different. Going from one chapter to another, like from Bronze to Iron, requires re-inventing and re-learning everything: transportation, agriculture, war, healthcare, music, self-defense, medicine, and everything else that makes up a civilization.

As we already discussed, biological evolution is slow but involuntary; thus, the biological game of evolution never stops.

Technological evolution isn't so certain. 

After seeing Caesar's bridge, the Germans didn't enter the Classic Age for hundreds of more years. The Romans stalled their advancement and were invaded and colonized by those same Germans. Advancing a civilization requires leaving the old one behind, which for many nations is so hard that it never happens.

One reason for this is personal happiness. Evolution is complex, challenging, and filled with failure. And new isn't always better. The best martial arts techniques are often the classic ones like left jabs and rear naked chokes. Sleep is often the best medicine. So, humans won't necessarily be happily combing through the many new traits each new age brings.

Regardless, Life demands the hard work of evolution. Adapting is the only way Life survives. The biggest reason for our refusal to evolve is the loyalty stories foster in humanity. Stories are meant to pass on knowledge to help people learn new tools and techniques. However, the people in power use stories to distract regular people from evolving new tools because new tools have new power bases.

America won the Industrial Age. It did so with hard work, ingenuity, and injustice. In 1970, America invented the personal computer and the internet. This technology is the future, but we are not yet in the Internet Age for the same reasons, seeing Caesar's bridge didn't upgrade the German barbarians all those years ago.

Evolving our society to the possibilities of modern technology requires holding teachers, leaders, trainers, pundits, and individuals up to the standards of evolution. Any story about "wokeness," "fascists," and all the other content filling out televisions and smartphones are only meant to keep us in the Industrial Age while laying blame for the social, economic, and other real-life pains that inevitably get worse when any creature stops playing the game of evolution.

<Flipper1970 />

_Ignoring evolution has us walking in circles inside a death spiral._

## Building the Bridge

All creatures must evolve. Once you realize humans can't evolve biologically, this new philosophy falls into place: technological evolution is the plot of human existence. But while storytelling connects us to good tools, it also keeps us loyal to old ones. So, we're often masked from the fact that our only path to success is leaving old ways of Life behind to harvest resources in a new way.

Although we can't evolve biologically, individuals with secure food, shelter, and water still have a biology telling them to defend their bounty. That's why we have many Industrial Age ideological stepmothers in our body politic.

The Industrial Age's way of Life is based around technology like broadcast radio and television, school libraries and lecture halls, corporate offices and meeting rooms, car and truck transportation, suburban housing and home remodeling, and so on down the Left and Right tools and techniques catalog. These adaptations are no longer enough to empower their users to climb ladders in the game of evolution.

So we don't climb the ladder to the Internet Age.

Instead, we continue industrializing society with too many large roads, cars, homes, planes, televisions, one-time-use products, and other mass-produced industrial goods. Regular people are left being Cinderella locked in the attic, wanting a better Life. Lacking the power of evolution in their minds, ordinary people must tell stories within either Conservative or Progressive ideology to justify why they should get priority access to the dwindling carcass of the Industrial Age.

- Hi, I'm a Progressive Activist. Years ago, my creativity imagined the Industrial Age policies and tools that spread unimaginable wealth to humankind. After the Industrial Age ended in 1969, I kept selling those same tools and policies; now they're totally bizarre. That's why my art films, marketing campaigns, and protests are a terrible return on investment. I used easy credit, cheap labor, and cheap energy to sustain my adaptations for decades, but they're both running out. To hide my ineffectiveness, I've been using a justice-loving public philosophy that because my, or someone else, parents and grandparents were abused and disadvantaged, I should still get the money I need to pay my mortgage and grocery bills. Take it from the Fascist Conservatives because they are greedy and evil and deserve nothing!

- Hi, I'm a Conservative Businessman. Years ago, my industriousness built the Industria Age's amazing companies, tools, and wealth for mankind. After the Industrial Age ended in 1969, I kept selling the same tools and companies using flashy spectacle. American homes, vehicles, and televisions are now enormous! They do the same functions, though, so we had to use easy credit, cheap labor, and cheap energy to pay for it all, and now it's running out. To hide my years of ineffectiveness, I've been using a liberty-loving public philosophy that says I should still get the money to pay my mortgage and grocery bills because my parents or grandparents were intelligent and hard-working. Take it from those lazy and evil Socialist Woke Progressives. They deserve nothing!

- I don't like politics. But as the cost of living rates go up, I'm looking for answers. I'm starting to think `insert name here` people are terrible, so I'm joining `insert name here.` My unspoken concern is that the technology that underpins my job is becoming obsolete, which sucks because I was planning on working at Blockbuster forever. I love Netflix, by the way; what are you watching?

- None of us knows what the `https:` on websites means.

We're an Industrial Age species trying to live in the Internet Age. Our real-life problems are mounting like they are for the polar bears. Tragically, the chance to bring our debt, inflation, insurance, and the cost of living rates<button @click="rdegg = !rdegg">*</button>down proactively and ease ourselves into the next chapter in the story of Life has passed.

Life has let 99% of all prior species die because they failed to harvest enough resources to procreate. Anyone who refuses to adapt to the possibilities of new Internet Age technology and instead follows, protests, and invests in Industrial Age ideologies, cultures, and societies is writing themselves on that list.

You don't have to join them.

Techvolution was written to individuals because individuals are evolution's unit of selection. Tall, short, Nigerian, Japanese, rich, poor, grade "A" student or not, it doesn't matter what group you were in the past. Nature gave individuals the right to evolve. Whoever adopts mixed-ideological politics and becomes a bumblebee searching the ecosystem for solutions to their pains selects themselves into the future.

Once you upgrade your politics with Techvolultion and its mixed-ideological politics you'll escape the attic and cross the bridge to the Internet Age. Once there, you'll notice how large the Internet Age ecosystem already is. Many inventors used their souls to create millions of incredibly cool Internet Age technology.

Bumblebee economics is ready; you only need to pollinate it.

The Internet Age has billions of products. No single ideology can filter them for you. You are unique. You need to mix-and-match tools and techniques to find which solve your frontline pains. And you can take whatever you want from prior civilizations with you. Your choices will define what gets saved from extinction.

Keep reading, and you will learn how open-source software and interoperable technology standards put wealth-generating power in your and everyone else's hands. Tools like React, Git, Ruby on Rails, USB, Linux, Shopify, YouTube, and so much more await you to discover your niche.

Evolution is inevitable. Techvolution, mixed-ideological politics, and bumblebee economics are the future. You will reinvent Life on Earth in the Internet Age. Jeff Goldblum says so. Why would anyone not follow him?

>If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that Life will not be contained. Life breaks free. It expands to new territories. It crashes through barriers. Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is....Life...finds a way.

[Ian Malcolm, Jurassic Park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiVVzxoPTtg)

I wish this summary was original. It's actually a remake.

Years ago, our ancestors had to evolve from the Medieval Age. Before they did, they had to drop the Catholic and Protestant political philosophy that said God wanted kings and queens to rule countries forever. If ever there was a public-facing philosophy designed to hold back everyone's evolution, it was the idea that firstborn sons always make for capable leaders.

Conservative and Progressive philosophers worked hard to detach Catholic and Protestant political theology from daily politics. They did it by creating religious toleration. After that came the separation of church and state and the freedom for people to mix-and-match their religious beliefs. Catholics and Protestants were thereafter free to work together to great mutual benefit during the Industrial Age via their shared ideology of regulated free-market capitalism.

Capitalism, of course, had a competitor, communism. Capitalism won because it unknowingly harnessed evolution. Its free-market principles empowered Life's game pieces--individuals--to buy and sell products that best solved their frontline pains. Regulation ensured wealth wasn't concentrated too much in the hands of the stepmothers of the world.

Communism was different. It empowered ideologically educated bureaucrats to plan the economy. These middlemen decided what tools and techniques strangers needed in their fight to survive. Unsurprisingly, within two generations, the foolhardy communist dream joined the 99% of all species that are dead.

Old philosophers didn't know about evolution, so it was hard to harness it. Techvolution takes some of what worked in old philosophies and includes the lessons of technological evolution.

As it does for all creatures, Mother Nature decided individual freedom works. America won the Industrial Age in the game of evolution. Our civilization canonized evolutionary freedom inside our constitutions, bills of rights, and democratic government. Life's evolution went smoother once authority was subject to frontline pain via a system of checks and balances. Stepmother stories fell in the face of problem-solving. As for our economic problems today. We must only realize that regulated capitalism allows technology to evolve freely at home, not at work.

- put a example, video etc. at the end of section that shows how because we don't measure frontline pain, we don't respond to it. we measure growth. so we should stop measuring housing starts, and instead measure mortgage paid off. outstanding mortages. homeless rates, etc.

Donald Trump is making the the middle-class great again. He's a self-made billionaire, giving regular people better jobs and honest government. Fight for him, like he fights for you!

No, wait. Donald Trump is am egomaniac con artist dragging America towards the flames of climate change, bankruptcy, and implosion. Join the fight against him!

This "Techvolution" is just more liberal elitism undermining real American values. I'll stick with proven conservatism and capitalism over this pseudo-scientific nonsense any day.

The "Techvolution" is just a ploy by the capitalist elite to undermine our vital progressive work. We need bold, revolutionary action, not compromises with the oppressors.

"Techvolution? More like techno-socialism trying to brainwash us away from the free market principles that made America great."

"I'll take good old-fashioned conservatism over this fancy 'evolutionary biology' nonsense any day. This is just liberal elites trying to undermine our values."

"Forget Techvolution - I'm sticking with the time-tested wisdom of capitalism and traditional family values, not some pseudo-intellectual fad."

"Techvolution is nothing but a distraction from the real revolutionary change we need. It's just the establishment trying to co-opt our movement."

"This 'Techvolution' is just another ploy by the oppressive capitalist class to maintain their grip on power. We won't compromise our socialist principles!"

"Down with Techvolution! We need bold, systemic transformation, not more empty rhetoric from ivory tower academics out-of-touch with the people's struggle."

"Techvolution? More like a Trojan horse for big government socialism to trample all over good old American capitalism and Christian values!"

"This 'evolutionary biology' nonsense is just liberal elites trying to brainwash hardworking patriots. I'll take my chances with the free market, thank you very much!"

"Forget Techvolution - I'd rather let a swarm of illegal immigrant locusts devour this country than let some ivory tower academics destroy our God-given conservative principles!"

"Techvolution? More like a dog whistle for the oppressive capitalist class to maintain their stranglehold on the means of production and crush the working class revolution!"

"This so-called 'Techvolution' is nothing but a shiny new distraction from the real systematic change we need - the gloves are coming off, comrades, and the bourgeoisie better watch out!"

"Techvolution? I'd rather eat glass than compromise our socialist ideals with some watered-down, corporate-friendly pseudo-science nonsense. The people's struggle cannot be contained!"

"World wars, economic collapse, climate change - that's all just fear-mongering as far as I'm concerned. I'll be long gone before any of that affects my cushy little life."

"Techvolution, civil unrest, environmental catastrophe? Sounds like a whole lot of hysteria to me. I've got mine, so why should I worry about the future?"

"The left wants revolution, the right wants to burn it all down. Meanwhile, I'll be sipping my mojito on the beach, safe from all their petty squabbles."

"Ideological extremists can fight it out all they want, but I'll be insulated from the fallout in my gated community. Techvolution? More like tech-no-thanks for me."

"Global instability, resource wars, societal collapse? That's a 'you' problem, not a 'me' problem. I plan to ride out whatever apocalypse is coming in the comfort of my private bunker."

"Let the world tear itself apart over Techvolution, socialism, or whatever the flavor of the month is. I'll be too busy enjoying my lavish retirement to get dragged into that mess."

"Techvolution opened my eyes to the fundamental laws governing human progress - no more getting bogged down in left-right ideological nonsense."

"Instead of parroting partisan talking points, Techvolution showed me how to ask the right questions and discover my own solutions to everyday challenges."

"Gone are the days of feeling helpless in the face of global crises. Techvolution equipped me with an evolutionary framework to navigate our technology-driven world."

"Techvolution isn't about easy answers, it's about developing the critical thinking skills to tackle complex problems head-on. A refreshing change from political theatrics."

"Rather than wasting time fighting the same old culture wars, Techvolution inspired me to leverage technology and innovation to improve my own life and community."

"Techvolution may not offer entertainment value, but it gave me something far more valuable - the tools to be an active agent of positive change, not just a spectator."

## What the ideologues say

*clears throat and speaks in a gruff, dismissive tone*

Bah, this "Techvolution" nonsense is just more of that liberal, elitist garbage trying to undermine good, honest American values. Who does this author think they are, trying to lecture us with their fancy "evolutionary biology" and "fundamental laws of life"? 

What happened to just standing up for hard work, family, and the free market? This is just another scheme by the left-wing academics to brainwash people and turn them against traditional conservatism and capitalism. 

And don't even get me started on how they're trashing the Left and Right as "ideologues" and "entertainment." That's rich coming from someone who's probably some coastal elite who's never set foot in a real factory or family-owned business. 

No, I'll stick with the tried-and-true principles that have made this country great, thank you very much. This "Techvolution" is just another fancy name for socialism and big government overreach. I'll take my chances with the good old Left-Right divide any day over this pseudo-scientific mumbo jumbo.

*spits on the ground* The only "progress" I care about is putting America and hardworking Americans first. This author can take their evolutionary nonsense and shove it.

--

*speaks in an indignant, self-righteous tone*

Ugh, this "Techvolution" nonsense is just another ploy by the capitalist elite to undermine the hard-fought progress we've made on the left. Who does this author think they are, trying to lecture us about "evolutionary biology" and "fundamental laws of life" as if that's somehow more enlightened than our proven socialist principles?

This is clearly just a thinly veiled attempt to discredit the vital work we're doing to dismantle systemic oppression, address climate change, and create a more equitable society. They want to act all high and mighty about being "moderate" and "pragmatic," but we all know that's just code for preserving the status quo and protecting the interests of the wealthy few.

And the way they dismiss the Left and Right as mere "ideologues" and "entertainment" is so condescending and elitist. As if our hard-fought ideological battles aren't the very foundation for the progress we've made! This author probably thinks they're so clever, but they're just another mouthpiece for the capitalist machine, trying to undermine the revolutionary spirit of the people.

Well, I've got news for them - we're not going to back down or compromise our values just to appease some so-called "moderate" agenda. The time for half-measures is over. We need bold, transformative action to create the just, sustainable world we know is possible. This "Techvolution" is nothing but a distraction from the real work that needs to be done.

*slams fist on table* No more playing nice with the oppressors. It's time to fight for a future that works for everyone, not just the wealthy elite. This author can take their evolutionary pseudoscience and shove it - the revolution is coming, whether they like it or not!
