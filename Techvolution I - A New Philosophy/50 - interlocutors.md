## Protagonist Paul Baran

I want to keep this book as snippy as possible. So instead of long histories, I'll highlight the battle over new tools in short bursts. Here's one about Paul Baran. A glasses wearing geek who was a real life Luke Skywalker.

There are many ways of sending data through a network. The simplest is how phone systems do it, with a direct circuit link between two phones. A call's connection only stops when someone hangs up.

Alexander Graham Bell invented "direct circuit links" in 1876 and put it into action when he co-founded the American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T) in 1885. For generations direct links was how all telecommunications worked. But when the Soviets tested a hydrogen bomb in 1955, Paul Baran took it on his shoulders to make a new tool to help prevent a nuclear holocaust.

Baran realized to prevent nuclear war, the world needed a communications network that would survive an atomic attack. Only robust and reliable communications would ease American and Soviet trigger fingers during tense times.

Baran worked alone for years. By 1960 he came up with the two key ideas he needed. His first was that his network should have no hubs or organizations (like telephone's have) to control the flow of information. Central hubs make systems vulerable to attack or failure. Instead data flow should be completely distributed so every node can send and receive information. Baran's equal nodes network looked like a fishnet. Each node only needed three or four links to make the system survive any attack.

Next Baran had to figure out how to send information across the network. This led to his second idea, which was to break up the data into standard-size little packets. A message would be broken into many of these packets, each of which would scurry along different paths through the network’s nodes and be reassembled when they got to their destination. This way there'd be no "dropped calls" and communication would always stay open. Baran published his ideas into detailed technical specs and made sure everyone, especially the Soviets, could copy his work.

Baran then walked into a nest of villians. When Baran's employer RAND recommended his "node-packet data network" idea to the Air Force (in control of America's nuclear missles) they wanted to build it. But when the Department of Defense got itself and the Defense Communications Agency involved Baran soon found out working with so many bureaucrats was hopeless.

So Baran tried to convince AT&T, in control of America's telephone network, to supplement their system with his node-packet data network. “They fought it tooth and nail,” he recalled. “They tried all sorts of things to stop it.” They would not even let RAND use the maps of its circuits, so Baran had to use a leaked set. He made several trips to AT&T headquarters in lower Manhattan. On one of them, a senior executive who was an old engineer looked stunned when Baran explained that his system would mean that data could go back and forth without a dedicated link remaining open. “He looked at his colleagues in the room while his eyeballs rolled up sending a signal of his utter disbelief,” according to Baran. After a pause, the executive said, “Son, here’s how a telephone works,” and explained a patronizing and simplistic description.

See how villians keep fighting change. Even the threat of nuclear holocaust didn't scare them away! Good thing Jedi's don't give up. Baran continued to push. AT&T finally had him and other outsiders to a series of seminars explaining how its system really worked. “It took ninety-four separate speakers to describe the entire system,” Baran marveled. When it was over, the AT&T executives asked Baran, “Now do you see why packet switching wouldn’t work?” To their great disappointment, Baran simply replied, “No.”

To heck with Darth Telephone!

Eventually Baran's network was built when the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) decided America needed a better communications network. In 1969 ARPA used Baran's technical specs to build ARPAnet, which slowly grew into our Internet. The distributed node network is why our internet, smartphones, apps resist control from governments and organizations. Everyone who uses the internet is equaly empowered. Nobody can stop anyone using it. This technological philosophy is like the vile racism Sophia believed in when she turned on Douglass, except the internet makes us holy.

Techvolution's job is to be the first explicit philosophy of the internet and other new tools. So let's get back to building Techvolution.
