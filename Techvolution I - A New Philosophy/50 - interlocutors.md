## Protagonist Paul Baran

I want to keep this book as snippy as possible. So instead of long histories, I'll highlight the battle over new tools in short bursts. Here's one about Paul Baran. A glasses wearing geek who was a real life Luke Skywalker.

===

There are many ways of sending data through a network. The simplest is how phone systems do it, with a direct circuit link between two phones. A call's connection only stops when someone hangs up.

Alexander Graham Bell invented "direct circuit links" in 1876 and put it into action when he co-founded the American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T) in 1885. For generations direct links was how all telecommunications worked. But when the Soviets tested a hydrogen bomb in 1955, Paul Baran took it on his shoulders to make a new tool to help prevent a nuclear holocaust.

Baran realized to prevent nuclear war, the world needed a communications network that would survive an atomic attack. Only robust and reliable communications would ease American and Soviet trigger fingers during tense times.

Baran worked alone for years. By 1960 he came up with the two key ideas he needed. His first was that his network should have no hubs or organizations (like telephone's have) to control the flow of information. Central hubs make systems vulerable to attack or failure. Instead data flow should be completely distributed so every node can send and receive information. Baran's equal nodes network looked like a fishnet. Each node only needed three or four links to make the system survive any attack.

Next Baran had to figure out how to send information across the network. This led to his second idea, which was to break up the data into standard-size little packets. A message would be broken into many of these packets, each of which would scurry along different paths through the network’s nodes and be reassembled when they got to their destination. This way there'd be no "dropped calls" and communication would always stay open. Baran published his ideas into detailed technical specs and made sure everyone, especially the Soviets, could copy his work.

Baran then walked into a nest of villians. When Baran's employer RAND recommended his "node-packet data network" idea to the Air Force (in control of America's nuclear missles) they wanted to build it. But when the Department of Defense got itself and the Defense Communications Agency involved Baran soon found out working with so many bureaucrats was hopeless.

So Baran tried to convince AT&T, in control of America's telephone network, to supplement their system with his node-packet data network. “They fought it tooth and nail,” he recalled. “They tried all sorts of things to stop it.” They would not even let RAND use the maps of its circuits, so Baran had to use a leaked set. He made several trips to AT&T headquarters in lower Manhattan. On one of them, a senior executive who was an old engineer looked stunned when Baran explained that his system would mean that data could go back and forth without a dedicated link remaining open. “He looked at his colleagues in the room while his eyeballs rolled up sending a signal of his utter disbelief,” according to Baran. After a pause, the executive said, “Son, here’s how a telephone works,” and explained a patronizing and simplistic description.

See how villians keep fighting change. Even the threat of nuclear holocaust didn't scare them away! Good thing Jedi's don't give up. Baran continued to push. AT&T finally had him and other outsiders to a series of seminars explaining how its system really worked. “It took ninety-four separate speakers to describe the entire system,” Baran marveled. When it was over, the AT&T executives asked Baran, “Now do you see why packet switching wouldn’t work?” To their great disappointment, Baran simply replied, “No.”

To heck with Darth Telephone!

Eventually Baran's network was built when the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) decided America needed a better communications network. In 1969 ARPA used Baran's technical specs to build ARPAnet, which slowly grew into our Internet. The distributed node network is why our internet, smartphones, apps resist control from governments and organizations. Everyone who uses the internet is equaly empowered. Nobody can stop anyone using it. This technological philosophy is like the vile racism Sophia believed in when she turned on Douglass, except the internet makes us holy.

Techvolution's job is to be the first explicit philosophy of the internet and other new tools. So let's get back to building Techvolution.

## The Boy Frederick

Where do our philosphies come from. Let's find out

===

Our story is about a Maryland farm boy overcoming ignorance. The farm is one of those classic farms you might you'll see everytime you watch "Little House on the Prarire". Salt of the earth farmers raising crops and families in 19th century rural America. Definitely no Wikipedia or Khan Academy to log into. Not even many books either.

The boy Frederick worked the fields with his mother. It was hard labour of course, there weren't many machines back in the 19th Century, but humanity is used to sweeting when cultivating the Earth. The boy worked hard, he wanted to keep his mother happy and fed. She wanted the same for her boy.

In a few years, the boy was sent to work with a relative in Baltimore. The house was large and the young family could use a hand around the house; cleaning, shopping, doing chores. It made his mother happy he wouldn't sweat so much, yet the boy was a farmer and unsure of the big city.

The father of the house was Hugh. He wasn't around much though. His new wife Sophia was. She was a foreigner used to colder climates, who didn't know many people yet, so she stayed in a lot. Sophia was nice and treated the boy nice too. Not as a farmer, but as a interesting person; not something farm hands were used to from rich people. She made Frederick feel at ease.

One day, Sophia handed Frederick a list of items to pick up from the store. Frederick's eyes looked down, his shoulders slouched, like a dog who disappointed its masters. Frederick mumbled "I can't read miss Sophia."

Sophia responded, "My God, well that won't do! Reading is good. How else can a person give and receive information from... from... the world! I'll teach you, we'll do it together." So Sophia taught Frederick to read. Just a few weeks, and he got the basics.

The world indeed! All those markings in the store, on street corners, in books, in newspapers, in the Holy Bible, they're each a new world! Go left, turn right, open, closed, discounted, welcome, and Salvation, all this stuff a door to a new world.

Frederick danced to the store, he whisked himself to do his chores, because he was learning more everyday. The world kept getting bigger, information kept pouring in.

One day Hugh came home early. He saw Sophia and Frederick reading at the dinner table.

Hugh walked into the room. "Boy, get out, and wait in the hallway. Face the wall."

Frederick got out, waited outside, and faced the wall. Seconds turned to minutes. Frederick rolled the newspaper in his hands tighter. He didn't want to go back to the farm. But even more, he didn't want his angel to get in trouble.

Inside the room, Sophia was curious "What is it? Everyone learns to read in Ohio"

Hugh responded "This isn't Ohio. He is a slave. What do you think happens when slaves reads. Do you think he won't start thinking."

Sophia's eyes went wide. "I didn't know the rules."

Hugh responded "Teach him."

As Frederick heard the hallway door open, he grips his newspaper.

Sophia said, in no angelic voice, "Turn around."

Frederick does, and looks at his angel, the one who talked with him like he was a person. And she looked back and only saw _her boy_.

Sophia slaped the newspaper from her boy's hand. He didn't let go. She slapped again, and again and again. Each slap hurt more than a dozen whips on his scarred back.

She slapped, and slapped, and slapped, and slapped. She will not do evil. She will not break the rules. Frederick's angel became a demon. Sophia was clicked by society's rules. Now she was a believer philosophy of racism to justify human slavery.

Frederick's world shut. The one white person ignorant enough to treat him like a person, was now an educated convert to the rules that put him into chains. Physical chains if needed, but evil prefers mental chains of ignorance; they stay on so much easier.

Weeks later Frederick was still in despair. His daily routine was the same. Yet, working under demonic masters is just different. He didn't dance to the store, he didn't whisk to do his chores, and he never saw Sophia smile again. Demons are always on guard.

One day, Frederick saw a newspaper, the avenue to knowledge whose path Fredereick was once on. He looked at the markings, saw some words he knew, and one word he didn't. Yet he still stared at it. Why?

The answer slapped him harder than the demon ever did, he read the words "The Freedom States in the North". He heard the word freedom before, but he didn't know freedom was a real place.

A shockwave went through him when he realized if slavery was a place, then so must freedom be a place too. Here Frederick realized he could break his own chains. Because ignorance was always his demon, and knowledge was always his angel. And he fought ignorance, and received knowledge, whenever he read.

So, Frederick taught himself to read. He practiced with ignorant white kids on the streets. He practiced reading items at the grocery store. He practiced on every street sign. And he practiced everytime he was at the Baltimore dock; the dock I said, you know the place, where ships will take you anywhere in the world. If you can read the schedule.

One day Sophia waited for her boy to return. But the boy died when the man Frederick Douglass walked onto the ship headed north to freedom. The man knew the exact time, place, and fare he needed to get on. He read it, himself, on the schedule. Reading opened the world to Frederick, and now the free world was opened to him.

The story gets better. Frederick Douglass becomes a brilliant orator and writer. In a world with no radio, video, or telephones, he travels the Northern States and Europe telling everyone the truth about slavery. When the American Civil War (1861-1865) broke out, his books help make Britain reject recognizing the South, and thus deprived it of a much needed support. The irony of a slave educating people about slavery, and thereby helping to end slavery is amazing to me.

### Darth Blockbuster's Secret Hideout

Of course Douglas was the hero, Hugh the antagonist, and Sophia the extra. I used their story to show you where philosophy comes from. Notice how Sophia wasn't a bad person by nature, but when she changed her tools, she had to change her philosophy to vile racism. Like we control a tool, its philosophy controls us. Even when it makes us evil.

Because we are cyborgs who keep changing our tools, and philosophy is how we connect with them. Guns, sports cars, airplanes, books, wikis, DVD's, online streaming, each have a philosophy to form a connection with their users. Use a tool, depend on a tool, and its philosophy warps your world with definitions of good and bad, like it did for Douglass, Hugh, and Sophia.

Here's the super-important realization. Once a new tool does arrive, the old tool only has its ruling philosophy left to fight back with. And here is where Darth Blockbuster hides.

Thus, attacking Darth Blockbuster isn't a technical battle, it's a philosophical one. But it takes time to write the philosophy for new tools. And extras on the frontline like Sophia follow established philosophies until a new philosophy steals them away.

That's why I wrote Techvolution. Because we already have the tools of the future. Yet inventors of digital tools struggle because they don't have a philosophy to tell the extras why open-source programming on GitHub, local manufacturing with 3D printing, maker controlled content on Vimeo and podcasts, managerless work on Lyft, Uber, AirBnB, and privacy protection on Firefox, should be their protagonists.

Techvolution is that philosophy. It's the philosophy for new and powerful digital tools to fight Darth Blockbuster for the love of society's extras.

## Weight Cutting

As a way to showcase how strong habit and stanford experiment/cave is.

## Sugar tasting food and cars

Seeing "through" or up the pyramid, to deconstruct society. Everyone has a hint of the functionality above, but often stays loyal to the ruling philosophy because of the love of an art below.

"What's the difference between gas V8 cars, and sugar food?"
