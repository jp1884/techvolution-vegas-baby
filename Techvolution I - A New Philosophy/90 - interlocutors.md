## Protagonist Paul Baran

I want to keep this book as snippy as possible. So instead of long histories, I'll highlight the battle over new tools in short bursts. Here's one about Paul Baran. A glasses wearing geek who was a real life Luke Skywalker.

There are many ways of sending data through a network. The simplest is how phone systems do it, with a direct circuit link between two phones. A call's connection only stops when someone hangs up.

Alexander Graham Bell invented "direct circuit links" in 1876 and put it into action when he co-founded the American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T) in 1885. For generations direct links was how all telecommunications worked. But when the Soviets tested a hydrogen bomb in 1955, Paul Baran took it on his shoulders to make a new tool to help prevent a nuclear holocaust.

Baran realized to prevent nuclear war, the world needed a communications network that would survive an atomic attack. Only robust and reliable communications would ease American and Soviet trigger fingers during tense times.

Baran worked alone for years. By 1960 he came up with the two key ideas he needed. His first was that his network should have no hubs or organizations (like telephone's have) to control the flow of information. Central hubs make systems vulerable to attack or failure. Instead data flow should be completely distributed so every node can send and receive information. Baran's equal nodes network looked like a fishnet. Each node only needed three or four links to make the system survive any attack.

Next Baran had to figure out how to send information across the network. This led to his second idea, which was to break up the data into standard-size little packets. A message would be broken into many of these packets, each of which would scurry along different paths through the network’s nodes and be reassembled when they got to their destination. This way there'd be no "dropped calls" and communication would always stay open. Baran published his ideas into detailed technical specs and made sure everyone, especially the Soviets, could copy his work.

Baran then walked into a nest of villians. When Baran's employer RAND recommended his "node-packet data network" idea to the Air Force (in control of America's nuclear missles) they wanted to build it. But when the Department of Defense got itself and the Defense Communications Agency involved Baran soon found out working with so many bureaucrats was hopeless.

So Baran tried to convince AT&T, in control of America's telephone network, to supplement their system with his node-packet data network. “They fought it tooth and nail,” he recalled. “They tried all sorts of things to stop it.” They would not even let RAND use the maps of its circuits, so Baran had to use a leaked set. He made several trips to AT&T headquarters in lower Manhattan. On one of them, a senior executive who was an old engineer looked stunned when Baran explained that his system would mean that data could go back and forth without a dedicated link remaining open. “He looked at his colleagues in the room while his eyeballs rolled up sending a signal of his utter disbelief,” according to Baran. After a pause, the executive said, “Son, here’s how a telephone works,” and explained a patronizing and simplistic description.

See how villians keep fighting change. Even the threat of nuclear holocaust didn't scare them away! Good thing Jedi's don't give up. Baran continued to push. AT&T finally had him and other outsiders to a series of seminars explaining how its system really worked. “It took ninety-four separate speakers to describe the entire system,” Baran marveled. When it was over, the AT&T executives asked Baran, “Now do you see why packet switching wouldn’t work?” To their great disappointment, Baran simply replied, “No.”

To heck with Darth Telephone!

Eventually Baran's network was built when the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) decided America needed a better communications network. In 1969 ARPA used Baran's technical specs to build ARPAnet, which slowly grew into our Internet. The distributed node network is why our internet, smartphones, apps resist control from governments and organizations. Everyone who uses the internet is equaly empowered. Nobody can stop anyone using it. This technological philosophy is like the vile racism Sophia believed in when she turned on Douglass, except the internet makes us holy.

Techvolution's job is to be the first explicit philosophy of the internet and other new tools. So let's get back to building Techvolution.

## The Boy Frederick

Where do our philosphies come from. Let's find out

===

Our story is about a Maryland farm boy overcoming ignorance. The farm is one of those classic farms you might you'll see everytime you watch "Little House on the Prarire". Salt of the earth farmers raising crops and families in 19th century rural America. Definitely no Wikipedia or Khan Academy to log into. Not even many books either.

The boy Frederick worked the fields with his mother. It was hard labour of course, there weren't many machines back in the 19th Century, but humanity is used to sweeting when cultivating the Earth. The boy worked hard, he wanted to keep his mother happy and fed. She wanted the same for her boy.

In a few years, the boy was sent to work with a relative in Baltimore. The house was large and the young family could use a hand around the house; cleaning, shopping, doing chores. It made his mother happy he wouldn't sweat so much, yet the boy was a farmer and unsure of the big city.

The father of the house was Hugh. He wasn't around much though. His new wife Sophia was. She was a foreigner used to colder climates, who didn't know many people yet, so she stayed in a lot. Sophia was nice and treated the boy nice too. Not as a farmer, but as a interesting person; not something farm hands were used to from rich people. She made Frederick feel at ease.

One day, Sophia handed Frederick a list of items to pick up from the store. Frederick's eyes looked down, his shoulders slouched, like a dog who disappointed its masters. Frederick mumbled "I can't read miss Sophia."

Sophia responded, "My God, well that won't do! Reading is good. How else can a person give and receive information from... from... the world! I'll teach you, we'll do it together." So Sophia taught Frederick to read. Just a few weeks, and he got the basics.

The world indeed! All those markings in the store, on street corners, in books, in newspapers, in the Holy Bible, they're each a new world! Go left, turn right, open, closed, discounted, welcome, and Salvation, all this stuff a door to a new world.

Frederick danced to the store, he whisked himself to do his chores, because he was learning more everyday. The world kept getting bigger, information kept pouring in.

One day Hugh came home early. He saw Sophia and Frederick reading at the dinner table.

Hugh walked into the room. "Boy, get out, and wait in the hallway. Face the wall."

Frederick got out, waited outside, and faced the wall. Seconds turned to minutes. Frederick rolled the newspaper in his hands tighter. He didn't want to go back to the farm. But even more, he didn't want his angel to get in trouble.

Inside the room, Sophia was curious "What is it? Everyone learns to read in Ohio"

Hugh responded "This isn't Ohio. He is a slave. What do you think happens when slaves reads. Do you think he won't start thinking."

Sophia's eyes went wide. "I didn't know the rules."

Hugh responded "Teach him."

As Frederick heard the hallway door open, he grips his newspaper.

Sophia said, in no angelic voice, "Turn around."

Frederick does, and looks at his angel, the one who talked with him like he was a person. And she looked back and only saw _her boy_.

Sophia slaped the newspaper from her boy's hand. He didn't let go. She slapped again, and again and again. Each slap hurt more than a dozen whips on his scarred back.

She slapped, and slapped, and slapped, and slapped. She will not do evil. She will not break the rules. Frederick's angel became a demon. Sophia was clicked by society's rules. Now she was a believer philosophy of racism to justify human slavery.

Frederick's world shut. The one white person ignorant enough to treat him like a person, was now an educated convert to the rules that put him into chains. Physical chains if needed, but evil prefers mental chains of ignorance; they stay on so much easier.

Weeks later Frederick was still in despair. His daily routine was the same. Yet, working under demonic masters is just different. He didn't dance to the store, he didn't whisk to do his chores, and he never saw Sophia smile again. Demons are always on guard.

One day, Frederick saw a newspaper, the avenue to knowledge whose path Fredereick was once on. He looked at the markings, saw some words he knew, and one word he didn't. Yet he still stared at it. Why?

The answer slapped him harder than the demon ever did, he read the words "The Freedom States in the North". He heard the word freedom before, but he didn't know freedom was a real place.

A shockwave went through him when he realized if slavery was a place, then so must freedom be a place too. Here Frederick realized he could break his own chains. Because ignorance was always his demon, and knowledge was always his angel. And he fought ignorance, and received knowledge, whenever he read.

So, Frederick taught himself to read. He practiced with ignorant white kids on the streets. He practiced reading items at the grocery store. He practiced on every street sign. And he practiced everytime he was at the Baltimore dock; the dock I said, you know the place, where ships will take you anywhere in the world. If you can read the schedule.

One day Sophia waited for her boy to return. But the boy died when the man Frederick Douglass walked onto the ship headed north to freedom. The man knew the exact time, place, and fare he needed to get on. He read it, himself, on the schedule. Reading opened the world to Frederick, and now the free world was opened to him.

The story gets better. Frederick Douglass becomes a brilliant orator and writer. In a world with no radio, video, or telephones, he travels the Northern States and Europe telling everyone the truth about slavery. When the American Civil War (1861-1865) broke out, his books help make Britain reject recognizing the South, and thus deprived it of a much needed support. The irony of a slave educating people about slavery, and thereby helping to end slavery is amazing to me.

### Darth Blockbuster's Secret Hideout

Of course Douglas was the hero, Hugh the antagonist, and Sophia the extra. I used their story to show you where philosophy comes from. Notice how Sophia wasn't a bad person by nature, but when she changed her tools, she had to change her philosophy to vile racism. Like we control a tool, its philosophy controls us. Even when it makes us evil.

Because we are cyborgs who keep changing our tools, and philosophy is how we connect with them. Guns, sports cars, airplanes, books, wikis, DVD's, online streaming, each have a philosophy to form a connection with their users. Use a tool, depend on a tool, and its philosophy warps your world with definitions of good and bad, like it did for Douglass, Hugh, and Sophia.

Here's the super-important realization. Once a new tool does arrive, the old tool only has its ruling philosophy left to fight back with. And here is where Darth Blockbuster hides.

Thus, attacking Darth Blockbuster isn't a technical battle, it's a philosophical one. But it takes time to write the philosophy for new tools. And extras on the frontline like Sophia follow established philosophies until a new philosophy steals them away.

That's why I wrote Techvolution. Because we already have the tools of the future. Yet inventors of digital tools struggle because they don't have a philosophy to tell the extras why open-source programming on GitHub, local manufacturing with 3D printing, maker controlled content on Vimeo and podcasts, managerless work on Lyft, Uber, AirBnB, and privacy protection on Firefox, should be their protagonists.

Techvolution is that philosophy. It's the philosophy for new and powerful digital tools to fight Darth Blockbuster for the love of society's extras.

## Weight Cutting

As a way to showcase how strong habit and stanford experiment/cave is.

## Sugar tasting food and cars

Seeing "through" or up the pyramid, to deconstruct society. Everyone has a hint of the functionality above, but often stays loyal to the ruling philosophy because of the love of an art below.

"What's the difference between gas V8 cars, and sugar food?"

## Painting Shy

The American Revolution was finally over. After 18 years of war, the divine British nobility swallowed their pride, admitted they lost. The and met their once colonial subjects in France to sign the Treaty of Paris in 1783. Of course the British were too proud to sit for the official painting with the "commoner" Americans. It didn't matter; America was the protagonist who rose above the ruling philosophy, changed it, and won a free country with a ruling philosophy of "all men are created equal".

The French nobility deserve some credit for the big win. They sent their military to help the Americans, which turned the tide at the all important battle of Yorktown. When hosting the after party the French nobility toasted to their success while giggling at the British for being "camera shy", or whatever the term is for avoiding painted portraits.

The French extras weren't giggling. They were listening. The returning French soldiers had some captivating stories. French taverns, halls, and tennis courts filled with the extras banquets and balls. Mental chains broke across the nation as a symphony of simple questions were asked; "So Rousseau's ideas weren't nuts?", "The people are in chains?", "We can break these damn chains?" The once scared, tired, and beaten French extra grinned as they realized they could make the fairy tale stories of liberty, equality, and community, come true.

Surprise! The French people had their own revolution just six years after the American peace was signed.

Now the world, through European and American, was about to get a new ruling philosophy. The new tools of books, guns, and scientific instruments changed the rules. In particular free-speech, gun ownership, separating church and state, and government checks and balances were written into Constitutions; which replaced the Holy Bible as the ultimate written authority to make the rules. It wasn't perfect; early America had slavery for crying out loud, yet the seeds of liberty were planted and nobody could, or did, stop their growth.

This is your ruling philosophy today. The one you need to change with techvolution. Here's the backstory of prior changes to tell us how that should look.

## Traitorous Eight

Breaking the rules. It's is a risk. It's a challenge. It can be disastrous. Because you could be wrong. But without risk comes no change. And what's better than you risking, is changing a society to make breaking the rules the norm, and being scared to becomes risky.

This happens. When movies started, they left the stiffling rule book of East Coast America, filled with patent lawsuits and office politics, and went to Los Angeles. The young industry was hell-bent on solving problems, chief among them how to tell stories with film cameras and projectors. Hierarchy meant nothing, problem solving was the path to success. The biggest success was Irving Thalberg, who ran MGM studios at 21. Within a few decades these trailblazers made "Hollywood" was one of Amercia's biggest industries, one that spanned the globe. Now the industry now breeds Darth Blockbuster's, trying to keep the success of old risktakers alive for themselves. Yet the legacy of telling your story lives on in every YouTube, Vimeo, and video made in the world today.

It happened again in California half a century later, in a place we know call Silicon Valley. Here's how.

"But Noyce's most enduring legacy cannot be measured in buildings, accolades, awards, or honors, not in dollars earned or given away, nor in stock price or market share. It cannot be etched in silicon or printed on microchips. There is an informal soft of generational succession in Silicon Valley that places Noyce near the top of the family tree. A few years ago, for example, the founders of Google asked Steve Jobs for advice and mentorship in the same way Jobs had come to Noyce when Apple was young. And even when there is no such explicit tie back to Noyce-even if the latest generation of entrepreneurs do not know his name-his influence endures in a set of ideals that have become an indelible part of American high-tech culture: knowing trumps hierarchy, evey idea can be taken farther, new and interesting is better than established and safe, go for broke or don't go at all. There are countless other influences of course, but Noyce's vision is embedded deep in the eye of the swirling energy that is Silicon Valley, his spirit quietly urging anyone who might listen to 'go off and do something wonderful'." _The Man Behind the Microchip_ page 307

## Personal Darth Blockbuster

Is your personal Darth Blockbuster getting your down? I can sympathize. When I was under his superiority-complex control, and I needed a pick-me-up, I'd go over to Wikipedia and hit the "random article" button and wait with glee for one of the five million options to comes up. From a deserted island, to the tailor who invented the cumberbum, whatever it is, to the frontline these things were important enough to say "people gotta know".

It still makes me smile because I know I'd never see Darth Blockbuster's article. Hierarchical success is nothing. A mirage. Nobody ever thought of the Super Executive Vice President "people need to know".

## You Don't Work for a Company

We get paid by companies, but we are actually tool users. I mean, say you're a newspaper printer at the New York Times. You could go to the New York Post and do the same job. So although newspapers compete with each other, they're tied to the same technology and tools.

You can see this divide yourself. Tell your co-workers and company you're leaving for a new industry. They'll give you well wishes and a good bye cake. Tell them you're going to a competitor. They'll make fun of you, and probably give you a good bye cake. Now tell them you invented digital newspapers. You've questioned their livelihoods, and they'll be scared.

But not everyone. Some people will be curious, some happy, and some will even fight back. And this battle over technologies is where the protagoinsts, antagonists, and extras reveal themselves.

## The Moment of Philosophy

What kind of car was the other guy?

## Prologue

I wrote this for the people on GitHub, Bitbucket, Slack, Figma, Sketch, and whatever else you Jedi are working on. Learning the ecosystem of your tools was super cool. Learning your unspoken philosophy was even cooler.

Most people don’t yet know the power of digital tools. It’s too different, like an animal inside a different ecosystem. The fact any person can visit GitHub, go to the Ruby on Rails site, and download it for free is like owning your own newspaper. Not only that, the fact you can see the people who are working on it, what every person did, and when, and even contribute your own help, is a world as different as Cinderella walking into the banquet because she wanted to, not because a fairy said so could.

Open source still can’t run the world. Read The _Innovators_ and Walker Isaacson will explain how the trifecta of academic institutions, private corporations, and the military was perfect to create the digital revolution. Likewise, it was for profit companies, academic institutions, and open-source programmers who kept it going.

But open-source the next step in human evolution. It’s so pivotal because it’s a check and balance to anyone trying to control too much. Darth Blockbuster literally couldn’t stop a few hackers from giving the world internet streaming. A upgrade that’ll we’ll see in the next book actually saved tens of millions of dollars and a few hundred lives (in short, less car accidents).

Even cooler with open-source, work is tracked, ideas are debated, results are shared. Some people are dicks for sure, but nobody thinks they’re a king. People work when and where the want, and we all get and give better results because of it. No uniform requirements. No “BEEP-BEEP” of bell. No boss trying to keep his job relevant with some bullshit marketing meaning. It’s not perfect. Shit happens. But try working elsewhere on the frontline and you’ll see a big difference.

Open-source is the new world. One that I only wanted to learn about. Now I want to liberate. There’s no difference between the soldiers who fought Darth King Charles, George III, or Louis XVI and you, the modern minuteman who doesn’t work for money, but to advance human evolution.

You all feel the “majic” of new tools, yet have a hard time explaining to regular people, because humanity still doesn’t really understand how our “cyborgology” changes us every time we pick up a radio, a smartphone, a lightsaber (one day!).

Another big motivation for me to write this was it pisses me off red / blue politics seeps into your political conversations and thoughts. Those philosophies are older then Cobol, and worth nothing to anyone building the future. They want to keep people watching the news, rather than living their own story. For anyone to become their own hero, they need tools. Way to understand how their taxes work, analyze which politician is voting for what bills, and protect their data from being sold to the highest bidder.

My hope is that with Techvolution, you can better explain why open-source is making the world a better place to extras wondering why you work so hard making Deno, Node modules, Common Voice, or the endless projects piecing together a brighter future like so many Wikipedia articles, one edit now at a time. Terms like “Darth Blockbuster”, “Death Star rule book”, “internet Jedi”, and soon to come “Life Star” put the world in a black and white way, not based on color, but which person gives the people tools to live a better life. Which person fights to let them use tools to improve their lives.

Avoid the red/blue philosophies. They march like its Woodstock in in 1969, because technologically speaking they never want us to move passed 1969. The power of digital tools is completely unseen to them. You could transfer them back in time and they wouldn’t notice. Gas cars, broadcast televisions, 9-5 work days, two car garages homes, retirement savings; their ideal way of life is a never ending The Simpsons episode. Red/blue, equally and without difference, are now self-entitled characters in an art film living a life of banquets and balls.

There are many Darth Blockbuster’s in this class of artists. They live by inheriting the control of DVD stores, accounting companies, insurance brokers, bureaucratic office jobs, and the like. They write rules to stop the hierarchy of old tools sending them back to equality. They do so with the outmost sincerity and conviction that they’re the “martyrs of the people”. The power of digital tools is as lost to them as books, guns, and telescopes was to Darth King. It’s too bad. They’re usually very well-intentioned people, but they’re just way behind the times.

The people are distracted like fans of an old sitcom to notice we don’t get tools to solve our problems. We’re so use to seeing the same political family names, cable news shows, 60 Minute interviews, gas car product logos, to notice our story isn’t a classic one with people overcoming problems anymore.

The aim is simple. When you're talking about your job to a regular person, I want you to be able to say to "I am empowering you with new tools to help you live a better life" with a well deserved confident smile" then adding "and _they_ are holding you back". And if they question who and why, just tell them to read _Techvolution_.
