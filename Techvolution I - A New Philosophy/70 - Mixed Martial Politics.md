## Ordering a Hamburger

I'm going to make a complex point in a simple way. We've all ordered a meal before. We go to a restaurant, look over the options, and say "hamburger with fries". The waitress writes it down, and you wait.

What do you do while you wait. You read a book, listen to music, talk with your friends, joke with your spouse, watch your kids draw on the napkins. You're free to do whatever you want. Because while your meal is being made, you have no involvement whatsoever.

In 20-30 minutes the waitress returns, serves and the food, smiles and says "enjoy". You and you're companions are happy, and chow down.

If something is wrong, you let your senses tell you. If the burger is raw, or the fries are mushy, or the mayo is foul, you touch, taste, or smell it and alert the alarm of "Jenn, something's wrong".

When Jenn comes, you tell her, and... what if she were to say "well our cook used the proper cooking techniques, so it's not our fault. It must be the supply company. Or maybe it was the other cook."

You'd never take that excuse, and continue to eat your meal. This simple example, showcses what's wrong with our politics. I'll explain it more by getting into a fist fight.

## Mixed Martial Arts

Lifeforms fight. Resources are limited, and according to nature, lifeforms have to use them as efficiently as possible. Efficiency let's more lifeforms live, and this biodiversity empowers life to better probe for environmental changes. Fighting sharpens life against disasters.

Lifeforms have their own agreed up ways to fight. Most obviously seen during mating season. Males face down, and use their horns, paws, heads, of whatever shared weapon to determine whose the strongest. The winner mates.

But lifeforms hardly ever act outside their instinct. A smaller lion doesn't attack the bigger one at night, and effectively murder the competition. Within species there's an agreed way to fight.

That explains human combat systems. Boxing, kickboxing, judo, karate, tak-won-do, jiu-jitsu, wrestling, each is fighting. Yet each has its own rules, and safety nets. Boxing is punches only. Kickboxing doesn't let you hit a downed opponet. Tak-won-do doesn't have punches. Judo is take-downs, , jiu-jitsu submissions, wrestling is man handling. Each martial art, use the same human body, with the same goal to defeat an opponent, and a set of rules each opponent agrees on.

Then one day, someone removed the rule book, and started the sport of Mixed Martial Arts. Originally it was meant to answer which martial art was best if they fought each other. Soon everyone learned the answer throwing away the rule book.

In MMA, there are very few outside rules (basically no weapons, eye gouching, or groin strikes). In MMA persons are free to do almost anything to win. Punches, knees, submissions, clinches, holds, chokes, locks, throws, taunts, insults, work rate, kicks. Mixing these martial techiques is the art with variations nearing infinity. No one can master it all. Persons have to learn fast. Persons have to keep learning.

"Submit and learn" is a strongly believed mantra to MMA fighters. MMA fighters cross train every discipline like boxing or jiu-jitsu, all the while concentrating on mixing it all together into their own fighting variation. The sport of MMA has changed so much in just a few years because the main source of success is asking what works best. This is why MMA fighters will defeat any other kind of fighter. They adapt faster.

To fight MMA is the ability to be honest and reflective and care about results, not methods. When an MMA fighter goes up against a tak-won-do specialist, the latter keeps saying how the former "breaks the rules". Yet results is the rule.

Science learned the same lesson. You, individually, don't know how nature works. You test it, you probe it was an hypothesis, and use instruments to test your experiment, and then trying to find what answer nature tells us is true.

MMA is the same thing. There is no established rule book. Let the results tell you what to do. So when you watch a MMA fight, and listen to the corner's advice between rounds, what you hear is practical advice on the situation, and how to win the next round like "use kicks, wrestling, try a submission".

What you don't hear is "he's breaking the rules". Because the only natural rule is the natural selection of tools that best solve the problem.

## Canoe Ride

With ordering a hamburger, fighting MMA, and watching a canoe ride, we'll now fix our politics.

## Mixed Martial Politics

I can't do this anymore. I run away when I see a clip or anything. But, if you still can, watch cable news, especially a political debate, and the supposed analysis afterwards. The politician in office will get bombarded by accusations of rule breaking. And he'll defend himself by defending the rules.

When you ordered the bad hamburger, and the waitress said "we used the approved corporate cooking techniques, so it's not our fault the hamburger is raw", would you ever even care? No. The hamburger is raw. I can touch, smell, and taste the truth. I don't care what rule book you followed. The result is the only thing that matters.

When a MMA fighter sits down between rounds and is bloody from being punched hard. If a wrestling coach tells him "keep it up, he's breaking the rules by punching you, that's not allowed in wrestling" that coach is a moron. There are no rules, but adapting yourself to the problem, to get the result.

When a doctor looks through a microscope and says "that's impossible", he's an idiot. We don't learn anything with a personal rulebook, but instead with a blank one that writes down observations, and adapts ourselves to what it says.

Yet, in politics today, we the people, are distracted by fake rules. We pick a team, red or blue, and let our leaders get away with telling us we have to live with bad hamburgers, or getting the shit kicked out of us in a fight. Pundits and reporters are like karate and judo specialists analyizing a true fight, pointing out the "rules" are being broken.

I, and you, shouldn't care at all what methods, ideologies, beliefs, or opinions our elected leaders have. At all. We should only care about the results. I want a atmosphere with less carbon in the air every year. I want less traffic on the roads. I want less car accidents. I want less.. or more of...

All this happeneings are trackable now. And thus, we can track the results of our politial and economic leaders in making them happen. Raise taxes, cut taxes, private health insurance, public health insurance. Whatever way the cook, fighter, or doctor wants is good with the rules.

And based on history, and theory, the ultimate answer to each will be more individual empowerement to pick one's own tools. Only the cook, the fighter, the doctor, the person encountering the problem, knows what tools. And like in any ecosystem, our job isn't tell enforce human rules, but in making sure other lifeforms are being efficient with resources, so we all keep adapting life on, and beyond, Earth.

We haven't adapted a ruling philospohy to help us make use of our tools. We're like a fighter trying to fight judo to win an MMA fight. It's...
