Are you happy? On the outside, Westerners have flashy products, full employment, and stable politics. On the inside, our middle-class deals with stagnate wages, crushing debts, antisocial behavior, political hatred, climate change. We have the freedom to vote Left or Right, moderate or extreme, and we've tried them all, but none have helped.

In this book, I argue our unhappiness is a sign of a bigger problem. Our ideologies are very outdated. They were created in the Industrial Age, and since 1970, we've been in the Digital Age. Our ideologies are holding us back from progress, which is causing our frustrating lifestyles and massive social problems. We need a new philosophy—one created to harness the remarkable potential of digital tools.

Here it is. Its big lesson is this. The middle-class has to step up and use digital technology to solve our own problems. If we don't, we'll keep suffering the pains of civilization running on old—ideological—fumes.

## Dedication

_This book is for the people in the open-source community. For the collaboration philosophy you handed down to me. For selflessly updating Wikipedia, writing free software, and building cool new tech for us all. For being the protagonists of the Digital Age. You gave the best education a political guy can get. I hope I’ve learned enough to write this book._

_For the antagonists, the self-entitled delegators keeping Blockbuster—and it's Industrial Age mentality—alive, thanks for causing history to repeat itself yet again. I hope you learn something._

_This is especially dedicated to the extras on Main Street. Because when it’s time for you to act, I pray you pick the right side._

## Quote

"_We are really the revolutionaries in the world today—not the kids with long hair and beards who were wrecking the schools a few years ago._"

# Introduction

## Looking Up - How does civilization develop?i

How do we develop through technological Ages? Going from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age or the Medieval Age to Scientific Age happens over generations—it can be hard to get our head around. I've been thinking about it for years and only now have a grasp. There's a lot to think about when a civilization's entire way of life upgrades to new technology.

Play computer games like _Age of Empires, Anno 1800_, and _Civilization_, and you'll get a good idea of how civilizations develop through the ages. You'll be the "player god" who organizes society, gives people orders, saves up resources, invests in science, and decides when to click "upgrade" to a new age. When you do, civilization instantly transforms. Like magic, every house, factory, building, road, library, school is suddenly new and improved.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/FortunateFluffyAfricanporcupine' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

The above is a game, of course, but it represents reality pretty well. We're all in there somewhere right now, trying to figure out how to earn a living while our society changes around us. It's hard—there is no player god and no magic button. Instead, we, the people inside the game, must collect the resources, do the research, and manually transform every part of our civilization bit by bit with blood, sweat, and tears. We can't sit back, click, and watch. We must live it.

Improving technology is hard work, but at least we understand how to do research and development. Improving politics isn't so straightforward, especially when society has one foot in an old era and one foot in a new era. This uncertainty is the world of politics and philosophy, civil wars, and revolutions I want to help you get a better sense of. Because in 1970, we entered the Digital Age. Since then, computer geeks, innovators, and hackers have been upgrading our society with ever more powerful digital ones. All the while, established Industrial Age powers have been holding them back.

Holding back technological and social development is why middle-class life is getting worse. Things will only improve once we finish the Digital Age upgrade. There's no shortcuts, cheats, or gimmicks. There's just you and your friends on Main Street. You all have to get out the sweat-bands, work gloves, and new ideas to upgrade every piece of our civilization to the Digital Age, bit by bit.

This book integrates lessons from the history, politics, and philosophy of prior upgrades, but it's not written for any buff. It uses the power of stories to help the people inside today's game—the middle-class—improve their own lives. The first step is a new mindset. Because we already have digital tools. We only need to believe in a modern philosophy to enjoy all the wonders of the Digital Age.

## Looking Up at Philosophy - We develop with new tools and philosophys

This book's illustration is a regular person standing on Main Street-a single person in the game of civilization. His or her job is to do what's best for themselves, and help society prosper. She's looking up for guidance and sees two options—heroes and villains. In the sky high above is the mythical "player god" whose playing the game. Will he play to benefit society or to benefit himself?

ILLUSTRATION

In a computer game, when the player god presses the upgrade button, society instantly transforms. In reality, we upgrade our society when we shop, do car repairs, and save up for a new home. Funny to think about, but our choices while shopping, dieting, socializing determine the health of our entire civilization. Yet we often don't think of ourselves as being "player gods". But that's the big picture, isn't it? That, in fact, it's all our individual choices that make up the player god in a real-life civilization.

The more individuals realize the big picture and act like their actions matter, the healthier their society. And the job of inspiring individuals to believe in the big picture is the job of political philosophy. And that's who the hero and villain are in the illustration. They represent the good and bad choices a regular person can make.

So what the heck are good political choices today? Every newspaper, politician, and political party says they're the heroes fighting for the good of our civilization. But politics has so much disagreement. How can the regular person on Main Street know the difference between heroes and villains? What's defines good and bad political opinions?

So there you are, on Main Street, looking up, trying to figure if Donald Trump is evil, or if the United Nations is trying to make a world government. You ask if Fox News is manufacturing fake news, or maybe "all of them" are. If so, what's real news? The questions never stop. Should the government-run health insurance, or a big corporation regulated by the government? Is climate change real? If so, why does my "green" obsessed company force me to drive to work every day? Whose fault is massive government debt? And if no one takes responsibility for the debt, what's the point of blaming anyone?

It's all very confusing and emotional. Yet you have to pick sides. After all, you're part of the player god as much as anyone else. Wouldn't it be cool if a philosophy showed you the difference between good and bad politics today? It is cool; it's calming to understand politics. And it's one reason why I wrote this book. So I, and whoever reads it, can better understand what's wrong with our society today. Because I wrote a new philosophy so we can finish the upgrade, and finally enjoy the glorious Digital Age.

## Your Politics - it's hard to see new philosophies, we're the ones who change

When a computer player in a civilization game upgrades technology, we can see technology changed. Installing a sewer, damning a river, building a road, is very obvious.

When the computer player upgrades technology, a new philosophy comes with it. Like when we went from Monarchy to Democracy during the Industrial Age. But we can't see this change in real-world objects. The upgrade happens in our minds.

For example, we all believe in "Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." But we're unsure what that means in everyday life. Today we have several ideologies to help find specific answers. Conservative or Progressive. Libertarian or Socialist. Republican or Democrat. All these ideologies battle each other for the support of Main Street. Individuals pick one to help make their own political opinions.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/GrimyHonestFallowdeer' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Technology, government, and political upgrades really are as simple as hitting "upgrade" as the player does in the clip above. It's just so damn hard to see when it comes to philosophy and politics because it's our minds that are changing.

That being said, people are good at picking an ideology and then fighting for their political opinions. It's easy to argue, debate, vote, read books, and listen to radio shows. But understanding our political opinions is entirely different. Few people say, "My family is old money. I have a huge trust fund. So I'm coasting through life.". Instead, that person says, "White privilege doesn't exist stupid!" Nobody says, "I'm gullible and work with lots of Liberal Arts graduates, so I don't like Trump because the crowd hates him." Instead, that person says, "Trump is not presidential!"

The point is, even with ideologies to guide our opinions, the real reason for our political views is hard to know. We all look up at the same ideologies; we all try to "think of the big picture," yet we arrive at different answers. Our opinions are a by-product of our psychology, job, skillset, family, culture, ethnicity, religion, time-period. Who can understand how all these factors intermix to make a political opinion? Why does one parent cry tears of sadness, the other of joy, on the same election night?

I can't explain it either. But I can tell where you are in the story of civilization. Because when civilization upgrades to a new age, everyone becomes divided into the same cast of characters. The bad guys struggle to retain power for themselves, the good guys' fight to distribute power to the people, and the people—the ones on Main Street—make a choice. Does the regular person help the protagonists upgrade civilization, or help the antagonists hold back progress? And, doing nothing supports the villains.

Today digital technologists are fighting to give the power of digital technology to Main Street. The people who control Industrial Age technology are fighting them off. And the people on Main Street have a choice, do they step up to help the good guys? When we upgrade to a new age, the answer to that question is the only political opinion that matters. To help the most, the people must believe in a new philosophy.

## Read Now or Read Later - We either change our minds now, or we fail the game

There's a heck of a lot of emotions in Western politics today. Better put—people fucking hate each other. And many of those people don't know why. They're just mad. And not mad in the "I stepped in the puddle" sort of way. Mad in the comic book supervillain whose plans for world domination are going up in smoke "because the other side is ruining everything!" sort of way.

Let's get some perspective. People's days are increasingly unhappy. We pick an ideology to help us. Conservatism and Progressivism are the big choices. Both of them spread around the world on the back of the Industrial Age. Now that we're in the Digital Age, both ideologies can't make use of digital technology. The bent towards wealth generation of Conservatives, and the priority of wealth distribution of Progressives, both requires fights over regulations, tax rates, subsidies, and other matters of government policy. However, property generation and distribution are automatically achieved with digital property. Digital books, lectures, graphics, communications, manuals, paperwork is easy to generate and distribute. As our world becomes more virtual, the old Industrial Age mentalities make less and less sense.

But rather than rethink hundreds of years of "Left vs. Right" politics, people on each side stay committed to their beliefs. They can't see philosophy as being temporary. So each side blames the other for being outdated. Businessmen keep Conservatism relevant by "fighting communists," while social justice warriors keep Progressivism fresh by "fighting fascists." Fascism and communism (thankfully) died decades ago. Old ideologies keep their believers engaged by creating, then fighting, phantoms.

Left and Right use these phantom ideologies to rationalize calling themselves Luke Skywalker and "the other side" Darth Vader. Left and Right want to distract the people—and themselves—because both sides are antagonists. Neither party understands the Digital Age. Which is why we need a new philosophy.

We've upgraded our philosophy before. Sadly, philosophies usually upgrade after their factions kill each other off. The Thirty Years War (1618-1648) is an example. It was a very long war between the many kingdoms of Europe that marked the beginning of the end for the Medieval Age. Regular people were very unhappy with their lives. They chose between Catholic and Protestant factions, and slaughtered "the other side" on behalf of "holy kings." Once the carnage ended, however, the people realized they were no better off—and what they were sick of all along was all kings. Thus, it wasn't long until ordinary people upgraded from the Medieval Age. They fought for a new philosophy (Democracy) in the American Revolution (1776) and the French Revolution (1789). Today Left and Right are in a similar boat. They make people think they're the only options. Fighting with impeachments, disputed elections, rallies are what two factions do when neither can admit they're both behind the times.

It's important to remember, Conservativism and Progressivism helped us achieve great things in the Industrial Age. But politics is only supposed to help people see the big picture, so our civilization plays the game well. Ideologies should never be self-serving. Today Conservatise and Progressives exist to satisfy their members because neither helps regular people live happy lives.

Do people today watch TV or exercise at night? Do we read a book or watch infotainment? Do we seal your leaky taps or rant about climate change with another tweet? We are all a single person in the game. We can only change our own actions. And our efforts are pivotal. Because you're the player god. Ideology is only supposed to help people realize that, and you make better choices. Right and Left don't help people today make better choices, because they're not from the Digital Age, so they distract people with hatred rather than good ideas.

To see the big-picture again, we need a new philosophy. One that looks ahead towards the boundless horizon of the Digital Age. One that sees Tesla, SpaceX, Blue Origin, as a sneak peek for the wondrous future each person should be building now, bit by bit.

I've studied this topic for years. Both academically and in business. I could have written this has a political theory book or a history book. Instead, it's written as how-to-manual to the people on Main Street right now. Here's how we get back to work and win the game. You'll like it best if you're sick of contemporary politics but love checking-out what Elon is up to. Because you'll understand most of today's political talking points that drive Left and Right to hatred, are with digital technology, actually rather simple engineering problems. You'll really like this book if you know that unless we see ourselves in the video below, evolution will find someone who does.

Dreaming about our civilization's future is not a joke. Only you can solve your own problems. Humanity will continue the blessed journey of civilization with or without you. I wrote this book to get us there faster and easier. It's written to be like _Second Treatise of Government, On Social Contract_, and _Common Sense_. All books that helped start modern democracies because they made the people on unhappy Medieval Main Streets realize the big picture, that we're all the player god. And if we don't step up to upgrade our political philosophy to the Digital Age, we'll keep suffering the unknowns of a degenerating society that keeps looking down at phantom socialists and fascists, instead of looking up to our future in the stars.

And if we keep fighting imagined ideological enemies, at least with this book, we can read what we could have done as we regret the choices of player gods who lost the game.

## Book Summary - Here's the grand mission 

Writer David Mamet once said being free from trying to please a group means being free to concentrate on Nature. So I embraced obscurity and was quite ambitious when writing this book. Saying that Techvolution is divided into three parts:

**I. A New Philosophy:** This part upgrades our political philosophy to the Digital Age. It gets Main Street to see the big picture that they're all player gods who must use digital tools to solve their own problems.

**II. Building the Life Star:** Explains the new political and economic truth we'll see in the Digital Age. When digital tools like apps, bio-monitors, and big data, the Life Star will show us where our political opinions come from. We'll be able to create definitions of political and economic right and wrong objectively. This will help us remove much political uncertainty in society. In short, the Life Star will do for politics and economics what scientific instruments did for physics and chemistry. The troubling part is many people won't accept what this new telescope shows us.

**III. Starting Starfleet:** We'll conceptualize digital tools totally detached from the Industrial Age. These products will make The Digital Age lifestyle one of "perpetual profit." We'll send the massive savings to Musk and his protegees and hence, start Starfleet.

===

Book I, A New Philosophy, has a pretty high goal. So, I want to be crystal clear about its purpose. We're in the new and wondrous Digital Age. But we're using the philosophy of the Industrial Age to run our society. That means not since the Conservatism (1791), and Progressivism (1859) philosophy cards were clicked have we had fundamentally new ideas in politics.

We need a new philosophy that factors in all the wondrous possibilities of digital technology, a philosophy that builds on the accomplishments of the past. We need a philosophy that empowers the people on Main Street to again see the big picture; that they're player gods whose choices determine the health of society. Watching TV isn't politics. Making good choices is politics. You should still vote, still debate what's best for your community, but using digital tools to improve your life, is your most potent political power. If other people don't follow, get them on board. If they yell out in Twitter comments that "you can't change the world!" leave them behind. Evolution sure will.

The people on Main Street today thus have the responsibility to find tools to solve their problems, which thereby solves the problems that plague today's middle class. The duty to solve problems also requires the freedom to choose any tool they want.

Tools can be anything: a thermal camera to spot leaky windows, the Waze app to lessen gridlock, or 3D printing a tool for your new business. The desire to seek out new tools is human evolution, which first happens in the human mind that reads a modern philosophy. We've upgraded our philosophy before. The book below is the best way I know how to do it for our society today. I hope it's good enough to click.

_These guys run a popular YouTube channel about computer hardware. They didn't like how YouTube changed in recent years and decided to make a new video service called Floatplane. That is real politics. Because it promotes evolution. It doesn't matter if Floatplane thrives or dies. We, as individuals, can only try new things and see what works. Solving problems, or supporting problem-solvers, is being a player god—not marching against climate change, screaming about Trump, or watching infotainment television. The struggle within our society today is regular people don't think to act like player gods. And even worse, it's often against the rules to because Industrial Age companies want us to keep using their stuff. More on overcoming that antagonism below._

# Prologue

## Fighting For The Digital Age - Our philosophy is already generations behind technology

We entered the Digital Age in 1970. Personal computers, the internet, email, and so much other digital technology all got their start in the 1970s. After years of imagining the future, science fiction became real products.

With every purchase, renovation, and Christmas gift since we've been upgrading our society with fundamentally different technology. Computers can be programmed, updated, and inter-linked. Digital property can be shared, erased, copied, and transferred with a few button clicks. A single laptop today can be a typewriter, radio, voice recorder, book, television, photo album, database, and so many other machines. In contrast, mechanical tools—like books, printers, radios— are single use, can't be easily shared, and are heavily regulated.

Even though they're different, digital tools have been brought up within the Industrial Age's philosophy. This philosophy is meant to encourage the growth of mechanical tools via relentless worldwide competition. Digital devices enable a new philosophy, one that fosters collaboration. Working together online is our future because it saves us from so much redundant work. For example, with Wikipedia, the world can use one website for its general knowledge, instead of reprinting, shipping, and buying millions of encyclopedia books every year.

Several generations from the start of the Digital Age, items like smartphones, laptops, and smartwatches are so standard, the collaboration philosophy they foster is part of our lifestyle. That's why WikiHow, IMDB, YouTube integrate so easily integrate into our lives. Collaboration is today's big picture, the basic principle of the Digital Age's new philosophy. The people who see this best is the open-source community.

## Open-Source Player Gods - Open-Source is pushing us forward

Open-source is a community digital inventors, designers, and programmers. They are the successors of the first digital protagonists—the player gods leading us into the Digital Age. They live, breath, and promote collaboration at places like GitHub, Wikipedia, Dribbble, Udemy, Stack Overflow, Unsplash, and Slack.

Open-source has given the world the Digital Age. Even if the world doesn't know it yet. Most people on the frontline still think that retail stores, manufacturing, and education are industries only for governments or big businesses to control. However, because of the open-source community, there are countless new tools available for the people to take control of their own products, identities, and lives. It's truly a new world. One where Cinderella can stop praying a fairy godmother gets her through palace gates. In this world, she can walk off of Main Street and go right to the ball because... everyone's always invited.

The open-source community exists to bust down the technological gates of the Industrial Age. They've empowered the people to share in our society's economic prosperity. Look around. Note the parents who are educating their own children on Khan Academy, the moms learning how to repair iPads for extra cash thanks to YouTube videos, the artists selling their own products on their own Wordpress websites, and the laid-off workers using Rails to make their own apps. Digital tools cut out the Industrial Age middle-man and empower regular people to work for themselves and collaborate with each other.

In short, the open-source community has empowered people used to be extras in the Industrial Age, hoping for a better life. Now they've become protagonist player gods in the Digital Age, making a better life.

I'm one of them. I'm a politics, history, and philosophy geek who spends far too much time thinking about his interests. Digital tools let me research, write, and host my own work. Better yet, I can find and work with world-class writers and illustrators to make that work even better. A few decades ago, I'd be in a library scribbling notes on cue cards and dreaming up ways to get a professor, publisher, or newscaster to look my way. Instead, I can share what I've learned with a Ghost Foundation website so anyone curious can access it from anywhere in the world. It may not seem like it, but we're both on Main Street, collaborating about where to take the "player god." All for virtually free.

## Mass Production Replaced by Mass Collaboration - Digital Age philosophy is collaboration/happy

As a kid, I helped my family clean office buildings. My simple role was to pick up the garbage and blue bins. It was straightforward. Years later, when working at a big office, the cleaners were short-staffed for a few weeks. Management spent hours meeting about and discussing the "garbage problem" instead of just wrapping it up (pun intended) and moving on.

The Industrial Age only had mechanical tools. Mass producing clothes, cars, newspapers needed lots of managers. However, today software can now replace much of that managerial work and let workers coordinate with each other.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(76.67% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/ObedientNiftyBlackbear' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p> <a href="https://gfycat.com/obedientniftyblackbear">via Gfycat</a></p>

Today's excessive management is a holdover from an age gone by. It's out of habit that our workplaces over-value control and delegation instead of contribution and collaboration. Excessive management turns leaders into gatekeepers. They seek to hold tickets and manage who'll "get access" to things like news services, retail stores, formal education, and especially the higher "positions" of corporate employment. Today's there's an entire class of middle-men, consultants, managers, and executives who don't know the skills of their industry like nursing, teaching, and (definitely not) cleaning. Their power is to manage the gates of an Industrial Age technology.

Comparing this world to the open-source community is like comparing the Stone Age to the Iron Age. The open-source community works together to make, improve, and open-up access to technology. Usually, the community collaborates on core technology, and then its members use the core technology to create specialized products. For example, a large open-source community creates MediaWiki software. Then separate groups use MediaWiki to create Wikipedia, WikiHow, and Fandom—or any other website you can think of. After all, MediaWiki is free for anyone to use however they want.

This is not to say that open-source communities are perfect and can run the world. Some of its people are too rude, projects die off, personalities clash, and so forth. In _The Innovators_, author Walker Isaacson explains how the trifecta of academia, corporations, and militaries was optimal for creating the digital revolution. Likewise, it was government, big business, and open-source organizing structures that worked to keep that revolution going. Open-source is only a part of the ecosystem bringing the Digitial Age and mass collaboration to life. There will always be big companies like Google, Microsoft with large corporate structures, always be government services running health care plans, and installing traffic lights.

That said, open-source is vital.

Precisely because nobody owns its technology. Server software, operating systems, web apps, and much other software is free to use. That means Industrial Age gatekeepers can't stop digital inventors empowering more player gods, enabling more collaboration, and pushing us into the Digital Age. Whether it's with a simple rotating list of persons to take out the trash. An online encyclopedia with millions of helpful articles. Or software to give society internet streaming. As when a few hackers tore down "Darth Blockbuster's" gate when he tried to keep us all buying and borrowing his VHS tapes and DVDs.

Open source is the good guys. The Jedi of our society. The modern minutemen because they enable individual empowerment and collaboration. They should be self-sufficient and very well-funded. But they are not. Many people in the open-source community who write articles, answer forum questions, and make programs do it as a hobby, not a job. Even their leading organizations need donations to stay afloat. Meanwhile, old tools such as universities, television broadcasters, and insurance companies get massive subsidies, tax credits, and bailouts.

To bring on the era of mass collaboration. Open-source needs to be flush with cash, and the support of the middle class.

## Fighting for The Future - The Collaboration Future Won't Just Happen

This difference between how the old and new tools are treated signifies our society's significant problem. We should be jumping into the Digital Age. But open-source heroes have to struggle against the odds to dismantle the gates Industrial Age antagonists are paid to maintain.

Once upon a time, I only wanted to learn about the open-source fight. Now I want to empower its protagonists. Mass collaboration, telecommuting, the right to repair, home power generation, and real internet privacy are just the tip of the iceberg. A better world is waiting once the open-source community has the resources to not only make new digital tools but to replace old Industrial Age tools. The open-source community must get political, get mad, and learn to be selfish. Because today's political battle is about upgrading society to the Digital Age. It's a story about New Age versus Old Age. Protagonists versus antagonists. Jedi versus Sith.

The most dangerous thing right now is ignorance. People don't know about open-source or the future they're fighting for. The people are stuck on "right vs. left" or "red vs. blue" politics. Red/blue leaders tout their horns, and the believers march and yell like it's Woodstock in 1969, because that was the end of the Industrial Age, and hence was the peak of their philosophy. The Woodstock way of life of single detached homes, 9-5 jobs, gas cars, long commutes, retail shopping, centralized power stations, and advertisement funded nightly news is a memory of "the glory days." It's no wonder Main Street has suffered from outsourcing, micro-managing, and climate change when the political stage fights to keep the past alive.

The open-source community doesn't march for change, their digital tools force it. I worked hard to turn their collaboration mindset into a new philosophy, which I call Techvolution. It's custom-made for open-source, the Digital Age, and to create more player gods. It combines centuries of historical and philosophical lessons most people don't have the time to read. It cuts through today's political jargon with terms like "Darth Blockbuster," "Death Star Rulebook," and "Jedi vs. Sith." So people can ask themselves the most important political question of our time.

It's not the worn-out and drab, "Am I for red or blue politics?" Instead, it's something far more powerful and relevant: "Am I going to step up and bring my society into the Digital Age?"

To do it, they have to believe in a new philosophy. One that rewards workers, creators, and collaborators—basically, the people who are willing to become player gods of the Digital Age. And that's the only political question you should be asking yourself. Choosing Red or Blue doesn't matter any more than voting for Protestant or Catholic on the ballot.

_This is Louis Rossmann. He repairs computers, which saves his customers lots of money. More than that, he advocates electronics should be better built and easy to repair. Some manufacturers, notably Apple, make it hard to repair our computers because they want us to replace them. Louis testifies before legislative committees and posts videos about his business and thoughts. He also teaches others how to open up their own repair business. You don't have to support his "right to repair" campaign (you should though). The point is because of digital technology and open-source, he easily collaborates with supporters, runs a business, and thereby changes his society. Another example of a player god doing real politics._

## Open-Source Lets Us Bust Open Gates - We can force the future now

Currently, when you phone a call center, everything is recorded. The company has access to the recording; you don't. Likewise, when the employee logs in and out of the office, that, too, is recorded. Management automatically has access to these timesheets; the employee doesn't.

Access to things like phone recordings and timesheets are barriers or "gates." They're holdovers from the mechanical tools of the Industrial Age. They needlessly give power to one person over another. Customers can't confirm what was agreed to during their last phone call, and employees can be grilled for a long lunch. Yet, the same manager quickly forgets unpaid overtime.

A lopsided balance of power allows customers and employees to be taken advantage of and encourages mistrust, bad products, and inefficient workplaces. Uneven power makes collaboration impossible.

The greatness of the digital tools of the open-source community is threefold. First, it sets a great example because it entrusts everyone with all information. Second, open-source wants more members, so the community loves to bust open gates to get more people in. And third, since no one owns open-source technology, the people can empower ourselves with tools that we wrongly only big companies are "allowed" to have. We can have our own phone recordings and timesheets.

Busting open gates of mechanical tools move us from the Industrial to Digital Age. It equalizes the balance of power. It treats people like adults and expects them to act like it, and therefore fosters collaboration. We have the technology to do this now. We need the people to step up, participate, and demand it.

Once we do, all workers—from waitresses, mechanics, teachers—will start to be managed less and collaborate more. It'll be a massive change, similar to how factories and production lines swept across our society during the Industrial Age. However, we're going to have to fight to let this new world brighten our days.

But all programmers, from elite to novice, individually ask questions, find bugs, contribute their work, and it all comes together via GitHub's software with minimal supervision. The process works similarly to Wikipedia. It's very organized; even with over 5,000 contributors over 15 years, you can see who has done what and when. Ruby on Rails software is priceless and is yours to use however you want. Get familiar with how open-source works. It's a tell-tale sign for the openness, responsibility, and immense value of work cultures coming in the Digital Age. You should be happy! Once you experience how easy, effective, and powerful worker-to-worker collaboration is, it makes work much better. And the best part, no garbage meetings or delegators are needed._

## The Setup to our Story - How do we get to the future

Let's recap all the above. We are in a new age. We all have to step up and upgrade our way of life to the Digital Age. If we don't, we'll keep suffering the pains of a degenerating society.  We do need to stop blaming "the other side." But our biggest roadblock is Darth Blockbuster—the self-entitled holdover from the Industrial Age.

Like Darth King before him, Darth Blockbuster has made a career of making up rules to keep his Industrial Age tools, and himself, in power. Before we can upgrade our society, we have to get rid of him. Happily, the Jedi in the open-source community are already fighting, but they can't win without Main Street.

And that's the set-up to the story of your life, civilization, and Techvolution. I really hope you pick the right side.

## Cast of Ideas and Characters

Here are a few terms that will put us all on the same page:

===

**Player god:** Imagine a person playing a computer "civilization building" game with our society and deciding where to put roads or how much to fund cancer research. Of course, there is no such player. In reality, it's the choices of individuals that decide what the community does. The player god is thus the collective consciousness of society.

**Philosophy:** The largely unspoken ideals that tell individuals what’s right and wrong, good and bad, in science, art, morals, politics, and economics. Philosophy is supposed to unite individuals to see the big picture; that everyone's choices matter, because everyone is a player god.

**Ruling philosophy**: A civilization’s chosen philosophy. One that all factions agree on. Examples include the "Divine Rights of Kings," derived from Christian theology and used in royalist Europe; "Marxist-Leninism" of the Soviet Union; and the combination of "red/blue" philosophies of the Western world today.

**Rule book**: The written and unwritten social, workplace, and legal rules that govern everyday life. The rule book is interpreted from the ruling philosophy.

**Technology:** A catchall term for things we make tools from, like concrete, lumber, nails, shingles, insulation, and bricks.

**Tool**: A catchall term for things we create with technology to solve a problem, like guns to kill bad guys, books to record and pass on knowledge, and houses to shelter in.

**Frontline:** The point of contact between a tool and the problem. Nurses giving vaccines, cleaners cleaning a city bus, and soldiers on the battlefield are all examples of frontline settings. People on the frontline work no Main Street with jobs that solve specific problems with a demonstrable skillset.

**Hierarchy**: A power structure that manages every tool’s use by society. Kings and queens with the keys to the castle, for example. As hierarchies grow larger, the bigger its authority gets, but also the more detached it gets from the frontline. People in the regime have titles like prince and executive, baron, and supervisor to mark their position—and, in a sense, their territory and "rights" in the power structure.

**The story of civilization**: The invention of new technology and the creation of new tools to overcome the most recent frontline problems. Civilization develops in technological ages; as new tools are adopted, they topple the hierarchies based on the tools of the prior age. We use tools to evolve.

**Protagonists**: People who invent, spread, and use new technology and new tools for the greater good. Usually close to the problems on the frontline, they individually struggle, but their continued self-sacrifice slowly and collectively improves life on Earth. I call them this world’s Jedi knights. We call their leaders trailblazers who often skirt the rules; Galileo, Nikola Tesla, Jay Last, Michael S. Hart, Steve Jobs, Linus Torvalds, and Elon Musk are among their number.

**Antagonists**: People who selfishly resist new tools to defend their wealth, power, and prestige atop a hierarchy. Antagonists usually manage companies or institutions based on dated technologies and think that working on the frontline is beneath them. They work to control the rule book, so they can hide behind it. We don’t often individually identify them. I coined the term "Darth Blockbuster" so we can.

**Extras**: Everybody in the middle of a battle between antagonists and protagonists. Because they have no direct loyalty to either side or their tools, extras can pick winners and losers. Usually, extras are in the middle class, not so poor as to be desperate, but not so powerful that they want to keep the world the same. Sadly, extras don’t realize their power. When they do, they become player gods.

**The Death Star**: The rule book when it’s controlled by Darth Blockbuster. Today it exists inside countless regulations, agreements, contracts, laws, and manuals that prevent new tools being used by people. The Death Star works to keep the Industrial Age alive.

**Techvolution**: A new philosophy empowering seamless human technological evolution by ridding Darth Blockbuster of his power, by giving extras the right and duty to decide when society should upgrade our tools.

**The Life Star**: A rule book based on Techvolution, governed by human technological adaption and natural selection that makes sure humanity never stalls when upgrading to the next technological age.

**Plot**: Getting the extras to step up, replace their ruling philosophy, and establish the Digital Age.

# ACT ONE

## A Small Upgrade - What happens when we try to upgrade to the digital age

It all started with a door in my face. And then, actually, a few more. I was either being too stubborn or too hopeful. Either way, I eventually learned my lesson. I was selling a web app that those in upper management weren't going to buy.

Before you wonder, it wasn't a matter of price, because there was no price. It wasn't a question of competition. None of that either. And I can promise it worked because I had spent years in a cubicle doing the frontline job it serviced. After years of thinking about political and economic theory in the Digital Age, I'd written a book (Starting Starfleet) about some untapped possibilities of new tech like smartwatch apps, bio-monitors, and bitcoin. I only made this simple web app (using open-source technologies) to validate some of my ideas.

I was right to. They were good ideas. I figured out how to solve a problem that saved 100 million dollars, 300,000 hours of worker productivity, and even dozens of lives. All I did was enable worker-to-worker collaboration with an app that was virtually free. Why wouldn't I want to tell people about the theory behind it?

Sadly, I was a fool. I didn't know it at the time, but I wasn't even knocking on doors. I was knocking on gates. See, I wasn't talking to the frontline workers (who thanked me). But to the bureaucrats, lawyers, managers, and executives who were well paid to "meet, discuss, delegate" about such "garbage" problems. As holdovers from the management of the Industrial Age, I went against all they stood for; solving their problems was asking them to fire themselves. Worse, I was asking them to invalidate their identity as being "superiors." They put up gates to shut out, not promote, Digital Age innovation.

In retrospect, this was damn interesting. I was standing at the historical spot. A place where the Industrial Age took its stand against human evolution. Evolution is of course problem-solving, and solving a problem is always resonable. It's very reasonsble for gazelle to run faster if being chased, or a polar bear to grow thicker fur if cold.

That's why the head office people never said no to me. No needs a reason. Instead, they simply said it was against the rules to say yes. You know—those obscure rules, hidden inside regulations and contracts. They believed in the rules, especially the one against frontline workers deciding on their own tools, and taking out their own garbage, so to speak.

Like anyone, I knew bringing new products to market is hard. I knew sales is difficult. I even knew antagonists exist. But I didn't realize how strongly the Digital Age was being held back. Antagonists masked their self-interest with self-righteous rule-making. In their eyes, I wasn't an innovator helping his society win the game, but just an "uppity extra. Society's upgrades be damned!

I don't want to talk about my experience too much. All that's important is this. There was a huge problem costing millions of dollars, weeks of workers' time (lots of it unpaid overtime), and maybe even your life. And it was against the rules to solve it. Even if I had won this battle for the Digital Age, it would be a tiny victory.

So instead, I'm going to talk about winning the war. Being attacked is what typically happens to so many innovations in our society. Our hospitals, schools, airports, roads, our entire way of life is being held back from the Digital Age by self-entitled holdovers of the Industrial Age.

I learned my lesson and wrote this book. Because despite already having the digital technology to transform our way of life, antagonists maintain gates all over the place to protect the pre-digital "Woodstock of 1969" way of life. They know—even if subconsciously—they lose their status, positions, and identity in a Digital Age economy. And that's why our lives are so unhappy. To improve our days then, the people need a new ruling philosophy... one that says improving our society is the only rule that matters.

## The Power Of Stories - To upgrade, we'll need to control the tools

Do you love stories? I think it’s a safe bet to say that you do. Who doesn’t? They entertain us after a hard day of work, bring us together to share our joys, and (my favorite) open our minds to the different rules and philosophies of foreign cities, mythical worlds, and galaxies far, far away.

Stories are so powerful because they’re so simple. Protagonists are good because they want to fix a problem. Antagonists are bad because they don’t. Stories aren’t debates. We take the protagonist’s side. Thus, Romeo and Juliet’s love is beautiful and worth dying for, while their families’ feud is ignorant and stupid. Luke Skywalker’s rebellion is righteous and worth fighting for, while Darth Vader’s empire is wicked and should be destroyed.

Our moral clarity about a problem turns the protagonists into our heroes and the antagonists into our villains. We thus follow their story with strong emotions, which burst out at the climax as we find out who wins.

Our hero fights hard to defeat the bad guys, but his superior morality, justice, and heroism aren’t enough. He’s often too weak or unskilled, and the villain beats him bloody. On the verge of failure, the hero needs to find something that’ll turn the tide in his favor. He seeks, sees, and reaches for his salvation: a tool or a weapon, like a gun, magic book, or lightsaber.

Will our hero reach it first, or will the enemy? We in the audience, like extras in the story, hold our breath because the story’s society is controlled not by desires, opinions, or rules, but by which character holds the tools. The wielder is the victor. The victor writes the rules. It’s the lesson that we the people need to learn for ourselves. Reaching, and holding, the tools is how we stop being extras and start being player god protagonists. Once we control the tools can we upgrade our civlization to the Digital Age.

## Put the Remote Down, It Controls You - to reach for the tools, we have to drop the phantoms

Our ruling philosophy is still red/blue. So we ignore reaching for the tools and instead let the red/blue rules control us. We shouldn't. I'll show you why.

Talk to any political junkie, no matter when, and they'll say there's a big election coming up. They'll say something like, "if the red team wins this one, then education, healthcare, infrastructure, and everything else will go to shit." What he means is elections decide the rule-makers, and that blue rules make a good society while red rules make a bad one.

If you buy it—and most of us have at some point—you watch blue cable news, read blue blogs, listen to blue talk radio. You start seeing phantom fascists and communists everywhere because you've filled your head with blue's philosophy. Soon enough, your car has blue bumper stickers, and you're waving blue bristol boards while screaming blue chants at rallies, marches, and protests. You feel like a hero! You're fighting against the evil red philosophy!... Or, if you got sucked in by the other side, evil blue philosophy!

Let me ask you this: if you're a regular middle-class person and you ignored the election, how much would you bet that you would know who won just by continuing to live your life?

When Team Blue wins, does traffic suddenly disappear? When Team Red wins, does everyone suddenly exercise? Do you breathe fresher air or see fitter neighbors? Do your real-life problems get solved when one color's philosophy writes the rules?

If you are still loyal to red or blue, or if you chase phantoms, you can stop reading now. There are lots of pundits, columnists, and commentators waiting to sing to their choir, telling you to stay an extra of the Industrial Age and fight "the enemy" until you're literally blue in the face.

If you don't like the choir, or you're starting to realize the "other side" consists of workers like you who are a part of the same struggling middle class, you'd probably like to keep reading. I wrote this book to make you a force in politics, a protagonist who fights with his friends to establish the Digital Age.

The first thing to realize is whichever color wins an election this year or the next and re-writes the rules; regular people will still pay taxes, have a huge mortgage, waste hours in traffic, pay increasing energy bills, sleep less than they're supposed to, get confused by their health insurance, earn far less than the CEO, endure customer abuse, get micro-managed, and hope their job (which they likely hate) isn't downsized or outsourced.

Under blue or red rules, the struggling middle-class lifestyle stays the same, because the tools with which we live our lives—like suburban homes, gas cars, call centers, centralized power stations, paper-based regulations, mass-produced unhealthy food, movie remakes and sequels, occasional doctor check-ups, and everything else in the pre-digital Woodstock era which built suburban America and Canada—all stay the same.

Phantoms aren't to blame. Laws, regulations, and policies, no matter the color, can help or hurt our lives a little, but they don't control the fate of middle-class people. Our tools determine our way of life. Nothing changes or can change between red and blue, because neither conservatism or progressivism works to put new tools into the people's hands.

It's not our politicians fault. Red and blue philosophies were created at the start of the Industrial Age. A time when humanity only had a few tools at hand. Red/blue philosophical fathers like Adam Smith, Edmund Burke, John Stuart Mill, and Karl Marx never had running water, listened to music on the radio, used the internet, made a phone call, opened a fridge, took penicillin, knew about electricity, started a motor, typed on a keyboard, or learned about evolution.

Instead, our red/blue philosophical fathers had mud roads, grandfather clocks, and abacus calculators. Doctors of their time prescribed blood-sucking leeches as a medical cure. Being hungry and sick, cold, and ignorant was a daily way of life back then. Red/blue philosophers dreamed of improving this primitive world with better tools. And, truth be told, they did! These philosophies got our ancestors to agree on the same "big picture"; that they all needed to industrialize society via mass production. Although Left and Right rowed their own oars, they were still on the same boat. Together they heaved and howed society towards economic growth. With every stroke society upgraded with steam engines, sanitation systems, science labs, telephone networks, broadcast televisions, and computers the size of rooms.

During Industrial Age, the people needed to be extras, regulated, and managed inside huge corporations and color-coded parties; someone needed to be on the factory floors and filling the desk jobs using primitive tools to make much better ones. To their credit, the blue and red philosophies at least gave extras a voice in how our tools' factories, regulations, and profits were controlled.

Today, however, we live inside the world the Industrial Age dreamed of making. We've grown a massive ecosystem of cities, factories, offices, telecommunications, and layers of infrastructure. The Industrial Age has done its job. It's time to transform the extras into protagonist player gods using the digital tools they worked so hard to create. Mass collaboration and economic efficiency is the Digital Age's big picture we should all believe in now.

We have the tools to jump into the Digital Age now. The iPhones, Tesla Solar Roofs, Lyft, WhatsApp, Kickstarter, Snapmaker, Khan Academy, HoloLens, Nano Membrane Toilets, Squarespace, Onnit, KaiOS, Airbnb, and Firefox and so many others are all so incredibly versatile, influential, and easy to make that they liberate individuals because they're customizable to fit every person's individual needs, enabling each of us to work far more efficiently, independently, and collaboratively in our home and work lives.

The lesson is this. Red/blue ideologies are Industrial Age. Once the people on Main Street stop thinking a bumper sticker, or fighting a phantom will change their lives, we'll be free to take control of digital tools and use them to change their own life. Only then will have the political power to make the rules and kickstart the Digital Age

Happily, we already know how to use digital tools. Although, people often say we're all addicted to our phones. We aren't. Checking news feeds, playing games, flying drones, and taking endless photos are acts of regular people learning to be player gods. Our ancestors did the same the last time they were extras, learning about printed books, telescopes, and muskets. Those were merely addictive toys until new philosophies turned them into  the lightsabers that brought down Darth King and the Medieval Age. It was controlling new tools that empowered Main Street to read unknown history, see the universe for themselves, and revolt against royalty.

Just so, we can also stop using our tools as toys and start wielding them as lightsabers to fight for a better way of life. We've just been waiting for a new philosophy to turn them on and bring on the Digital Age. That's Techvolution, a philosophy that turns extras into heroic player gods who are hell-bent on winning the game of civilization.

_Here's a small sample of red/blue cable singing to the choir. This is just like Protestand and Catholics fighting back int he day as well. The sermon this time was a campaign speech by Ms. Obama (the content is always the same. We're good, they're bad). This one clips showcases how petty both political sides are today. It was just a speech. How could it change the world either for better or worse? Since Right and Left ideologues can't make Floatplane, or repair your broken laptop, or make any product you might need, they huddle around it like consultants. Red/blue can only stay alive by fighting each other. This bullshit only works as long as you listen._

## Philosophies Either to Hold Us Back or Push Us Forward - once we believe in a new philosophy, we'll reach for the stars

Darth Blockbuster, outdated ideologies, and phantom enemies are not a new story. Once we upgrade to a new age, all three holdovers appear. The lesson is when upgrading society, we need a new philosophy. Here's one example.

When you look up at the night sky, you see a dazzling show. It can seem to defy explanation. But even with the naked eye, you'll see trends. The stars never move, some "objects" (really planets) look to be wandering, and it looks like the Moon, Sun, and everything else revolves around you. With all these trends, our ancestors were sure Earth was the center of the Universe. So much so, it was a pivotal part of the "Divine Rights of Kings" philosophy that ruled Europe during the Medieval Age (500-1400).

When you look at the night sky with a telescope, like Galileo (1564-1642) did in the Renaissance (1400-1600), you see it differently. Jupiter has moons, Venus has phases, and it looks like Earth is just another planet. When Galileo told everyone these facts, the "divine Catholic and Protestant leaders" were threatened. By using a telescope, Galileo was saying, "we don't know until we test, so let's use instruments to test what we think we know." Scientific inquiry questioned the ruler's divine leadership. Although Catholics and Protestant leaders hated each other, their political leaders both suppressed Galileo, and neither facilitated the new truths his new tools were discovering.

Galileo is just one example of how new tools bring on a new technological age. And how an establishment finds it very hard to embrace a new era. The lesson is, to enter into a new period, our civilization can't just use new technology. Main Street must welcome a modern philosophy too. Today we're also using an outdated philosophy. Here's an example of how that's hurting our daily lives.

Space travel is a significant step for humanity. It means better satellites, worldwide internet accessibility, and ensuring intelligent life doesn't put all its eggs in our one earthly basket. All possible _if_ we can build an affordable rocket.

Red/blue political culture was unable to deliver an affordable rocket. They can talk about speeches all day, but rocket science doesn't fit into soundbites. It was private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin (funded by a few rich guys) who answered the call. They harnessed digital technology and fostered collaboration to make rockets 10 times cheaper then red/blue politicians were doing. The rocket newcomers even learned to land their rockets so they can be reused, a monumental achievement that makes space travel even more possible. But many people, especially red/blue politicians, still didn't care. In fact, they often tried to stop these companies by saying they broke the rules.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/TerrificFinishedCaracal' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

_This is when SpaceX landed it's second rocket. Enable the sound to really get a feel how important this event was. It was a major step for the Digital Age._

When you're dependent on old philosophies, you're also confined to its old tools and live within its old narratives. Today red/blue politics obsesses over tiny tax cuts, pages of government regulations, and endless media soundbites because their philosophy says they're essential. New and super-powerful technologies like SpaceX landind rockets are talked about, but as a novelty act that falls beyond the believers of old philosophies comprehension and comfort zones.

That's the power of philosophy. It filters the definition of good and bad for its followers. Today, red/blue Industrial Age philosophies hold back the incredible, world-changing, happiness granting potential of the Digital Age. Affordable rockets are just one example. Up and down our economy, we use Industrial Age practices when digital collaboration is far better. The lesson is, once we believe in a philosophy that embraces the Digital Age we'll soar to the stars.

![old philosophy in a new world](/img\diagrams\techvolution-old-philosophy-new-world.png)
_Here’s a screenshot from a my Twitter feed on December 22, 2015, when SpaceX landed its first rocket. At the exact same time, red/blue ideologue Bernie Sanders was ranting about regulation battles with Wall Street. He should have been taking a minute to appreciate all the new solutions SpaceX just opened to humanity. I happened to be following Sanders, so I don’t mean to pick on him. The middle-class needs to stop putting their faith in old philosophies and instead follow today’s digital protagonists empowering us all with incredible new tools. Like we followed Galileo generations ago._

## This Is an Eternal War - Techvolution is a fight as natural as evolution

Fighting to transform society with new tools is a classic human story. It happens every time we start a new technological age. It happened when Galileo fought a religious establishment with a telescope, George Washington fought a political establishment with a musket, Steve Jobs fought an economic establishment with an iPod.

It's important to realize how each new age fostered human collaboration. Since Galileo, the scientific community shares its findings with each other. After George Washington won the American Revolution, he too fostered collaboration. Politics in a democracy is much less about military victories between kings, and much more about negotiations and elections between citizens. It can be said that progress requires working together.

We are embracing this history lesson. We want to empower people with new tools, often open-source ones, so workers on the frontline can collaborate. Note that this is not a book about how to invent tools. Amazing books like _Rework_ and _Zero to One_ already do that. Nor is this a book about the history of invention; _The Innovators_ does that better than I could dream of doing. If you want brilliant critiques of our society, _The Incerto_ and _The Great Degeneration_ are waiting for you.

This book is about pushing us into the Digital Age with a new philosophy that encourages our evolution. Nature thus inspires Techvolution. Notice that gatekeepers don't exist in our world's ecosystems. Evolution doesn't have anyone telling a cheetah she's running too fast, that the ants are too cooperative, or that a camel is too water-efficient. Individual lifeforms adapt as best they can to their own problems, and the winners survive. There are no middlemen and no gatekeepers, just problem solvers. And the problem solvers live on.

Human biological adaptions take so long, however, that ours have effectively stopped. We'll never biologically evolve to fly, do advanced calculations, or breathe Martian air. Humanity continues life's evolution with tools. We're basically cyborgs who adapt by upgrading our tools to the latest problem in transportation, calculation, and breathing. Hold a spear than a gun, an abacus than a calculator, a plane joystick than a space ship joystick, and you're a different and more powerful cyborg each time.

Nonetheless, our problem solving is held back when gatekeepers of a bygone age hold back civilization's upgrades. This is the equivalent of Blockbuster getting to write rules to keep us renting DVDs instead of saving time and money with YouTube and Netflix; basically, the opposite of evolution.

This classic battle between establishment and innovators fills stories from Greek mythology to Shakespeare. Today the most famous story is Star Wars, so I use it in this book. Star Wars is about a galaxy with an all-powerful energy field called the Force. Luke Skywalker's Jedi warriors' harness "the light side" to help others. Darth Vader's evil Sith lords' harness "the dark side" to help themselves and hurt all who oppose them.

In our world, we like to call our protagonists "trailblazers." Like Jedi knights, they struggle to empower us, cyborgs, with new tools. But we don't have a political name for the antagonists. Gatekeepers are often corrupt, but sometimes gates are good, and often, these people are just doing their job. Thus, I collectively call the antagonists to our technological evolution Darth Blockbuster: people who actively and knowingly prevent human evolution for the sake of their self-interest.

Since biological adaptions and upgrades are evolution, I've called human technological evolution Techvolution. This book is about inventing Techvolution. With Techvolution as a ruling philosophy, regular people are empowered to solve problems with technical upgrades as smoothly in human society as lifeforms do with adaptation and natural selection. Using modern technology to solve their own problems is how extras on Main Street become player gods and collaborate to win the game of our civilization.

And with Techvolution the people can finally kill Darth Blockbuster. Techvolution is a fight as natural as evolution.

## Nice to Meet You, Stargazer - And you're the hero, because you're the player god

You might be an open-source protagonist or an extra looking for work, either way, I'm calling you Stargazer. It's a name in honor of our ancestors who toppled the Medieval Age because they dared to look up at the night sky and ask questions. Anyone in society can wonder about what they don't know. So whoever you are, Stargazer, you need to know that the story to advance human technological evolution into the Digital Age can only begin with you. Because you're the player god our civlization needs.

And who am I to tell you all this? I'm nobody special. I haven't led the country, and you haven't seen me on the news. In my youth, I was a cleaner, labourer, movie usher/projectionist, and die-hard ideologue. After dropping the latter bad habit, I studied political philosophy, history, and innovation at the University of Toronto, usually while working full-time. I have a strong dislike for garbage meetings and other excuses people make-up to avoid work. I hate people with superiority complexes, especially when they're in positions of authority and suck at their jobs. That's why I learned far more about innovation by continuing working at the frontline as a line worker, an account manager, and a claims adjuster. Making a new tool and meeting my personal Darth Blockbuster was an education unto itself.

My life's experience began to teach me Techvolution. Watching the middle-class struggle to make a living owning, maintaining, and working with outdated Industrial Age tools—and knowing that the open-source community was meanwhile showing us a better way to live and work—ultimately motivated me to sit at the keyboard and uncover their collaboration philosophy so more people can live in the Digital Age.

But this book is not about me. It's about you. You are in a position where you wield a diversity of incredible and cutting-edge tools, even if you're unaware of it right now. From hospital cleaners to internet technical support, from engineers to claims adjusters, the bottom line is that you are at the frontline. Only workers on the frontline know firsthand the exact tools our society needs to keep us evolving in the Digital Age. The daily pain of real work makes you powerful. A piece of knowledge Darth Blockbuster will never have.

That's why you, Stargazer, are the hero of Techvolution. Don't be surprised. Average Joes and Janes are always the heroes. Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Neo, and Cinderella were all regular people. Heroes aren't born. They're stargazers, dreamers, believers, and achievers. They become heroes when they step up to defeat the bad guys. I'm like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Morpheus, or the fairy godmother, merely a guide to teaching you how to overcome the villains. So, the time is now, Stargazer, to leave the farm and join the rebellion.

The rebellion I speak of might be different than what automatically comes to mind. It is not a physical revolt. It does not involve rallies, marches, or protests. It's a rebellion of the mind. The Digital Age is held back by Darth Blockbuster, and his Death Star rule book. That's the reason the middle class is unhappy. Because we feel the Digital Age in our hearts but are forced to live in the Industrial Age to keep Darth Blockbuster happy. You're the playerone on Main Street. And you're happiness matters more. To earn it, we need to turn you into a Digital Age player god by sparking a rebellion in your mind.

## Mix Philosophical Politics - We build on the past, we don't erase it

Let's take a minute and answer some questions you might be thinking.

First off, living in a new age and starting a new ruling philosophy doesn't mean you throw away all the old stuff. Old philosophies, Protestant/Catholic, red/blue among them, will always teach us lessons, help us do our jobs better, and enlighten our personal opinions. Today old philosophies should not be our ruling philosophy simply because they weren't created with digital tools in mind.

Techvolution is. It's designed to make the best use of digital tools. Let me explain how Techvolution can be our ruling political philosophy by discussing evolution in martial arts.

Humanity has many martial arts: karate, kickboxing, wrestling, jiu-jitsu, judo, and boxing being among the most popular. Each martial art adapts the human body to do specific techniques like punches or choke-holds. Each martial art also makes rules, so only their chosen methods are allowed during competition; there's no kicking in a boxing match, for example.

In the early 1990s, the martial arts community got curious and wondered whose martial art would win a real fight. On reflection, it seems funny that this was an original idea. But before the 1990s, people just assumed boxers or wrestlers could not fight outside their rulebook. All fighters were supposed to be ideologically loyal and sing to their choirs about their techniques being the best. If a fighter got their ass kicked in a real fight, they'd often blame themselves or say the other guy "broke the rules" and "cheated."

The martial art community evolved. They held "no rules" tournaments and were fittingly rewarded with Nature's officially best martial art. The best martial art was none of them; or all of them. Meaning, the best fighters trained all techniques and used the ones they thought would defeat their opponent based on the exact moment they were fighting them. A large toolbox of techniques and an open mind to adapt proved to be the best martial art. Fighters soon embraced adaption and natural selection. This was the start of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA), a new sport that cherishes the evolution mantra "admit defeat and learn." And while boxers still punch the best, and kickboxers kick the best, evolution powered MMA fighters will almost always beat them in a street fight.

Red/blue ideologies are like non-MMA martial arts. They teach a limited number of techniques, limit themselves to their own rule book, and often think "the other side" is ignorant. Ideologues even accuse non-believers of cheating after losing a debate or election. However, in their area of expertise, from monetary policy to farm regulation, red/blue have a massive reservoir of know-how. This single book can't replace all that knowledge. It would be laughable to suggest it could.

But we still need a new ruling philosophy. One created from the lessons of evolution and digital tools old philosophies could not factor. Hence why this book is about making human technological evolution, Techvolution, the most protected political right and responsibility today. There's no other way to enter into the Digital Age.

You can think of Techvolution as "mixed philosophy politics." Under Techvolution, a person is free to study and believe in old philosophies. Ideals like equality, liberty, equity and so forth are all still valid. But no one should let the rule books of old philosophies determine right and wrong when up against a person's right to evolve on the frontline. Because to develop humanity, we the people on the frontline—the people in the real fight—need the freedom to decide which tool best solves a problem. The right to evolve must trump all other considerations. We build on the past. We don't erase it.

But we can't give old philosophies, or people whose power and prestige is based on old tools, the right to decide when we upgrade our tools. That is a recipe for staying in the Industrial Age forever. Which is why the middle-class is getting beat up by relatively simple problems like road traffic, waiting on hold, and confusing loan contracts.

Importantly, since Techvolution is a vital right of the Digital Age, it must also be a responsibility. But we don't need to master every single issue. Open-source members concentrate only on a few projects. It's the freedom to pick and choose that makes freedom so much better. The people feeling the pain are the best ones to find a solution.

Here are some projects—big and small—right now that could use some help.

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation recently funded TerraPower. It's a new nuclear reactor design that's much safer. It's a good chance for clean electricity. Not even Bill and Melinda can fund it all though. Given that the Digital Age runs on electricity, we should be asking ourselves if we should tell our governments too.
  
3D printers are amazing. They can make any small tool imaginable with no shipping, marketing, or retail stores needed. Anyone can print whatever they need whenever they need it. Sadly, most people have never seen a printer, nevermind bough one of it's products. That should change.

I didn't draw any of this book's illustrations. Instead, I used online tools to connect with illustrators. No job interviews, management oversight, or upfront cost. Collaborating with experts online is that easy. Once we look for it.

The digital ecosystem is larger than the examples above. It'll grow larger still once Main Street starts to push themselves into the Digital Age.

It's in your self-interest to do this. As said before, the Woodstock era is dead. Middle-class people will not get one job for life. We cannot assume "the government" or "the market" will solve all our problems. A "forever Woodstock lifestyle" doesn't exist. Think of this, about 80,000 people worked at Blockbuster, about 5,000 work for Netflix. Why would that automation trend stop for your industry?

In my experience, many people often reply, "won't happen to my job," then go back to watching Netflix.

Maybe it won't. But my not prepare? Digital tools don't threaten us. They're our salvation. If we use them, we can educate ourselves, lower our own cost of living, earn our own income, and, most importantly, collaborate. Can individuals become entirely self-sufficient? Probably not, but we can deal with layoffs, price-gouging, and bad jobs better with a level balance of power.

We're already starting to use digial tools to improve our lives. YouTube product reviews. Wikipedia articles. Cutting off cable and using Netflix. But there's so much more to do. And once the open-source Jedi finally get our support, we'll be spoiled for choices. And regular people wanting to use digital tools is the rebellion inside our mind we need to establish the Digital Age.

In short, Techvolution says, be selfish! You're a lifeform in Nature, don't let anyone hold you back. Demand your freedom! Freedom to speak our minds made the most of the printing press. Freedom to investigate Nature made the most of scientific instruments. Freedom to question royalty made the most of the gun. Freedom to buy products made the most of factories. And the freedom to solve your own real-life problems makes the most of digital tools.

Techvolution starts in your head. While you're watching a political debate, or attending a company meeting, ask yourself, "what's in this for me." Of course, red/blue politicians won't talk about a direct democracy app, and I don't want you to tell your boss to go to hell and quit your job. But a new technological age first changes in your mind. As you keep asking "what's in this for me," you'll seek out new digital tools. When you hold new tools, you hold political power. And holding power is how extras become player god protagonists.

That's why controlling tools is the Nature of all political battles. Whether in galaxies far far away, street fights in parking lots, wars between nations, or your own life. It's why antagonists to a new age make new tools against the rules. And why I needed to write a book to remind everyone philosophies and rules are supposed to serve human evolution, not get in its way. But since today our philosophy isn't helping us, it's time to update it. And since there are so many rules stalling the Digital Age upgrade Stargazer, we must pack our bags, rally our friends, and get ready for a fight. It's time to blow up a Death Star.

_This is politics. A regular person using a modern tool to find where he can improve his civilization. Will he upgrade his windows, recaulk them, or spray in some insulation. Asking what are better actions is a political debates. Now complaining about energy prices and climate change on Twitter? Which person would you want in your society if you were society's player god? We all should be doing simple things like this too. It'll make us happy because it helps. And once we've done our daily work, we can play basketball, watch a movie, or whatever else we want. Just don't chase phantom communists or fascists. You're better off sealing that drafty window._

# ACT TWO - BLOWING UP THE DEATH STAR

## Evolution Is on Our Side - When rules are in our way, we use evolution to defeat them

Life's been evolving for billions of years. Humanity continues life's evolution by creating technology. We develop new and better tools in stages like the Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Industrial Age. Unfortunately, transitioning between stages is hard. The powers of the old age hold back the modern era. Since we've entered the Digital Age in 1970, Darth Blockbuster has continuously defended his mechanical tools by making digital tools against the rules.

Some examples. In the 1970s, AT&T defended its mechanical telephone system monopoly by successfully lobbying the American government to ban internet modems. In 1984, the broadcast television industry tried to ban video cassette recorders (VCRs) and only lost by one vote in the Supreme Court. In 2001, the music industry defended compact discs (CDs) by successfully suing Napster for giving people digital songs. Likewise, Tesla, Uber, SpaceX, Airbnb's most significant competition has been in the courtroom. Throughout society, antagonists have found rules to keep people using mechanical Industrial Age tools.

This seemingly endless list of rules is the Death Star. This antagonism is why life on Main Street is getting worse. But before you face Darth Blockbuster and blow up his Death Star, Stargazer, you must learn what weapons you have at your disposal. The most formidable? The all-powerful energy field inside every lifeform. No, not the Force. I'm talking about evolution.

## The Magic of Evolution - How evolution works

Evolution is life's secret weapon. It empowers life by giving every new lifeform a slightly different variation. With variations, life can continually test for environmental changes in things like water levels, temperature, and food supply. The variations that can't make it die off, and the fittest survive. This natural selection helps life find which lifeforms are best suited to survive on Earth.

Evolution works so well because it creates biodiversity. Biodiveristy means there more lifeforms probing the environment for changes like temperatures increase or new rain patterns. The more lifeforms feel the pain of environment changes, the sooner life can adapt a solution to the frontline problem.

When the biodiversity is high enough, evolution creates an ecosystem. Ecosystems can be described as a "circle of life" food chain. Many plants, herbivores, carnivores, and decomposers, work to harvest resources. Grass turns light, water, nutrients, into biomass, eaten by the grazer, which feeds the predator. When everything dies, it returns all the nutrients back into the soil for the grass to keep growing. Each lifeform checks the other to be sure no one hoards or freeloads. Few of these lifeforms could exist alone. All these lifeforms basically collaborate then.

Evolution may not be the Force, but it's positively magical. In tune with Nature's own special rhyme and reason, evolution turned a lifeless planet into an oasis of many different ecosystems. The big drawback is time. Biological variations can take millions of years to respond to environmental changes. Think of the poor polar bears. They'll never understand why Arctic ice isn't reforming as massively each year. And even if they could, no lifeform can proactively change their biology.

In contrast, humanity can change—not our biology, but our "cyborgology," if you will (and hopefully in time to help the polar bears). We have the power to feel frontline pain, reflect on the problems causing it, and create a new tool to overcome the problem.

Techvolution is, therefore, intentional evolution. It's a more advanced and quicker form of evolution that isn't a magical mystery, as natural evolution is to polar bears, but is instead something we can understand. The question is, what drives us to evolve when Darth Blockbuster's Death Star often says it's wrong?

![genius-innovation](/img\diagrams\techvolution-genius-innovation.png)

## The Majic of Techvolution - How human techvolution works

We call someone a _genius_ when he or she uses existing technology to make a new tool. Happily, these trailblazers are self-motivated, and we already celebrate their intellect and innovations. But innovation isn't the only step toward Techvolution. We only truly evolve when the extras choose to use a new tool.

For example, think of computers. Before they could change the world, people needed to use them. To use a computer means learning how to type. And typing is a skill. In fact when stuffy Xerox execs saw the world's first personal computer, the Xerox Alto, they refused to use it because "typing was women's work." (Unsurpringly, many of the Alto engineers soon went to Apple and helped them make the MacIntosh). The point is, if everyone people refused to learn typing, computers would be useless. Only when individuals decide to learn how to use a tool, and integrate it into their lifestyles, does society upgrade.

So, what trick does Nature play on extras to reach for new tools when so often would be risking Darth Blockbuster's wrath? The answer is a force found within us all.

Unlike evolution, the trick is not actually akin to magic because we humans understand we're dropping one tool and familiarizing ourselves with another, like when swapping out the DVD player for Netflix. Yet there's still something wonderfully mystical about choosing to leave one's comfort zone to learn a new cyborgolgy. I call it majic; it's pronounced like magic, but spelled differently to note the critical difference to its homonym: it's the free choice of a regular person to proactively and intentionally evolve, even if they don't fully understand how they're upgrading civilization. Majic encompasses our yearning to explore, to learn, to grow, to live to our fullest potential, all of which require new tools to empower us to make real the dreams that exist in our minds. It's the first step to a new technological age.

Typically, we underappreciate how cool it is to learn new tools. But every time we try, we're like a drowning desert fox wearing fins and goggles, yelling out, "I'm getting better!" as he flounders in the water. Pushing our boundaries is what life is all about. It's majic that keeps us jumping back into the water and out of our comfort zone.

Techvolution is the ruling philosophy that encourages extras to "majically" bond with any tool they want so they can solve frontline problems as player gods. Yet what do we do when the Death Star says it's wrong?

**Majic**: The natural inclination of a person to learn, use, and hold new tools to increase their natural abilities.

DARWIN'S FINCHES
Charles Darwin discovered evolution. He visited an island chain, where each island had different climate. Darwin noticed the same bird was slightly different on each island. He then noticed each's beek was adapted to each a different good. Bugs, seeds, or nuts. Humanity mimicks evolution by inventing, and using new tools. Since we can drop and pick up tools, we can evolve so much faster than other lifeforms.

- Note: Majić is my family name. I lucked out because it reads like "magic" in English. It may seem egotistical to coin it as a term here, but I couldn't think of a better work. Primarily, the use of "majic" pays tribute to my parents. If you've liked this book so far, you'll know why.

- Sticking it to my personal Darth Blockbuster makes me smile too.

## Using Majic to Filter the Rules - How to tell the good from the bad rules

Despite our problems with our current philosophy, society always needs one philosophy that reigns above the rest. We use it to create the ground rules that glue us all together. Without a ruling philosophy, the story of mankind would be a story of chaos. There would be no such thing as civilization.

Darth Blockbuster fights to control the ruling philosophy. When he succeeds, he writes rules to keep the tools he commands, and therefore himself, in power. Corporate manuals, university guidelines, social justice blogs are among the pages of his Death Star rule book fighting off the Digital Age. These rules interfere with regular people's majically bonding with new tools. But how can you tell if a rule is good or bad? How can you pinpoint a rule book as a Death Star? Darth Blockbuster doesn't tell people he's Darth Blockbuster. Instead, he says he's The Executive or The Prince. Are these people genuine authority figures in the story of civilization, or Darth Blockbusters protecting their paychecks?

It's essential to filter out the good from the bad rules throughout our everyday lives. It takes practice, and it demands cultivating our integrity and inner truths. Yet it's a struggle that's been taking place for centuries. As an example, you needn't look further than this story of a Maryland farm boy named Frederick, who was born approximately two centuries ago.

===

Our story is about a Maryland farm boy named Frederick using tools to overcome ignorance. His farm is one of those you might have seen on shows like _Little House on the Prairie_. Salt of the earth farmers raising crops and families in 19th century rural America. No internet, no school systems, no much to learn but how to survive with your hands and the fortune God gave you.

Frederick worked the fields with his mother. It was hard labor of course, there weren’t many machines around, so he had to work hard, for himself and his mother.

In a few years, Frederick was sent to work with a relative in Baltimore. The house was large and the young family could use a help cleaning, shopping, doing chores. It made his mother happy he wouldn’t sweat so much, yet Frederick was a farmer and unsure of the big city.

The patriarch of the house was named Hugh. He wasn’t around much. His new wife Sophia was. She was a foreigner used to colder climates who didn’t know many people yet, so she stayed in a lot. Sophia was nice and treated Frederick nicely too. Not as a farmer, but as an interesting person. She made Frederick feel at ease.

One day, Sophia handed Frederick a list of items to pick up from the store. Frederick’s eyes looked down, his shoulders slouched, like a dog who disappointed its masters. Frederick mumbled "I can’t read".

"My God, well that won’t do!" Sophia responded, then continued "Reading is good. How else can a person give and receive information from... from... the world! I’ll teach you; we’ll do it together". So, Sophia taught Frederick to read. Just a few weeks, and he got the basics. Sophia performed majic and was overjoyed.

Frederick even more so! Finally, all those markings in the store, on street corners, in books, in newspapers, in the Holy Bible, mean something, a new world! Go left, turn right, open, closed, discounted, welcome, and Salvation, all words that open a new world.

Now Frederick danced to the store, he whisked himself to do his chores, because he was learning to read a little more every day. He loved how the world kept getting bigger, and information kept pouring in.

One day Hugh came home early. He saw Sophia and Frederick reading at the dinner table. Hugh walked into the room. "Boy, get out, and wait in the hallway. Face the wall".

Frederick got out, went outside, and faced the wall. Seconds turned to minutes. Frederick rolled the newspaper in his hands tighter. He didn’t want to go back to the farm. But even more, he didn’t want his angel to get in trouble.

Inside the room, Sophia was curious "What is it?". Hugh responded "This isn’t Ohio... Darling you can’t do that. We could get in a lot of trouble. You can’t teach them to read".

Sophia responded "everyone learns to read in Ohio".

Hugh takes a seat. "This isn’t a free State. He is a slave. What do you think happens when slaves read? Don’t you think they’ll start thinking?" Sophia’s eyes went wide. Hugh continued "It’s against the rules to teach a slave to read... now teach the boy".

As Frederick heard the hallway door open, he straightens up, and grips his newspaper.

Sophia says "Turn around".

Frederick does, and looks at his angel, the one who talked with him like he was a person. And she looked back and only saw _her boy_.

Sophia slapped the newspaper from her boy’s hand. He didn’t let go. She slapped again, and again and again. Each slap hurt more than a dozen whips on his scarred back.

She slapped, and slapped, and slapped, and slapped. Sophia was told her society's philosophy and it "clicked" for her. Now she knows what evil is and she will not do it. Sophia then and there became a demon protector of vile racism to justify human slavery.

Frederick’s world shutdown again. The one white person ignorant enough to treat him like a person, was now an educated convert to the rules that put him into chains. Physical chains if needed, but evil prefers mental chains of ignorance; they stay on so much easier.

Weeks later Frederick was still in despair. His daily routine was the same. Yet, working under demonic masters is just different. He didn’t dance to the store, he didn’t whisk to do his chores, and he never saw Sophia smile again. Demons are always unhappy because they're always on guard.

One day while doing his chores, Frederick saw a newspaper, the avenue to knowledge whose path Frederick was once on. He looked at the markings, saw some words he knew, and one word he didn’t. Yet he still stared at it. Why?

The answer slapped him harder than the demon ever did, he read the words "The Free States in the North". He heard the word freedom before, but he didn’t know freedom was a real place.

A shockwave went through him when he realized if slavery was a place, then so must freedom be a place too. Frederick realized he could break chains! Because ignorance was always his demon, and knowledge was always his angel. And he fought ignorance, and received knowledge, whenever he read.

So, Frederick taught himself to read. He practiced with ignorant white kids on the streets. He practiced reading items at the grocery store. He practiced on every street sign. And he practiced every time he was at the Baltimore dock; the dock I said, you know the place, where ships will take you anywhere in the world. If you can read the schedule.

One day Sophia waited for her boy to return. But the boy died when the man Frederick Douglass walked onto the ship headed north to freedom. The man knew the exact time, place, and fare he needed to get on. He read it, himself, on the schedule. Reading opened the world to Frederick, and now the free world was opened to him.

The story gets better. Frederick Douglass becomes a brilliant orator and writer. In a world with no radio, video, or telephones, he travels the Northern States and Europe telling everyone the truth about slavery. When the American Civil War (1861-1865) broke out, his books helped Britain reject recognizing the South, and thus deprived it of much needed support. The irony of a slave educating people about slavery, and thereby helping to end slavery, is the cherry on top of this great story.

_Story adapted from A Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass. Free on Project Gutenberg._

===

Frederick Douglass was a true Jedi Master. His exceptional bravery, persistence, and intelligence helped to showcase humanity's endless potential. He became an individual player god, and swayed the entire player god to upgrade society's entire philosophy against vile racism. The big lesson we learn from Douglass for our journey, Stargazer, is how to use majic to tell the difference between good and evil rules.

Sophia taught Douglass to read. She wasn't told to. She did it because we love teaching our chosen tools, whether they're soccer balls, new apps, or how to tape drywall. It's as natural to spread our tools, as it is for a species to propagate.

Teaching and learning are significant because it's the moment of creation. When a magician makes a playing card disappear, we smile in awe and childish wonder. That's cool, but nothing new was created, so we soon lose our joy. However, when a majician connects someone with typing, building, or reading, they've similarly performed something awesome. Still, it's not a temporary trick to be enjoyed at the moment. They've upgraded someone's cyborgology and effectively created a new and improved person. This makes us smile for a long time. Creation is majic, majic is Nature's long-lasting dopamine fix.

Yet human-made rules _sometimes_ say upgrading to a new tool is wrong. Upgrades aren't "allowed"—and this decree may be issued either directly or indirectly. Medieval parishioners couldn't read a science book, French peasant farmers couldn't have a musket, a 1990's kid couldn't download a digital song. Today millions of tired mothers can't telecommute.

Rather... the tired mothers can, they all have high-speed internet and home computers, but they don't.

The question is: why not?

There is no easy answer. Remember in no story does anyone ever say they're evil. Society's rule book will never call itself a Death Star. The lesson Stargazer is it'll never be easy to know the difference between good and bad rules. Anyone can proclaim rules. Even kids on the playground can say "only tall kids can play" and others, based on personality, will obey or not.

Majic is thus our best judge of the rules. Majic feels right. It naturally makes us smile. It improves us and our way of life. From teaching a kid to walk to teaching a grandmother to "Skype in" and watch her grandkid's first steps, teaching and learning new tools open our hearts because it turns us into player gods who work to improve ourselves and our civilization.

So, when you're teaching or learning a new tool and someone steps in your way with a rule, ask yourself if you feel wonderfully inspiring majic, and if you do, ask the rule maker why he doesn't. Perhaps there's a good reason. But keep Sophia in mind. Performing majic made her feel good while following the rules only made her feel safe. The Death Star operates by fear.

And safety is fleeting Stargazer. Human rules are created by hierarchies, which topple with every new technological age. Thus all rule books eventually expire. Majic never will. It always was, and always will be, in our souls. It's how we naturally test our rule book. Electricity, the microchip, the iPhone were all made by people who broke the rules. Yet we celebrate their innovators today because they invented new tools that let us feel and spread majic today.

Ignore majic at your peril. Look at Sophia, she gave one of our greatest writers and orators his start. Yet she lived a miserable life watching him achieve greatness because she broke the rules. Unhappiness is the inevitable punishment to everyone who ignores the joy of learning or helping others learn new tools.

It's a lesson for us to take in when we're stuck in traffic, or doing whatever else is giving us such unhappy lives.

_This guy's learning simple new things. And he's so happy doing it. This video goes along way to explaining why we aren't happy. We don't get to learn stuff because our workplaces still think it's the Industrial. A time when we manned the machines of mass production. But we're in the Digital Age now, which means you have to learn new tools. And if someone doesn't feel this majic, it's a good sign they're the one with the problem._

## Our Path Is Set - now we know the difference between good and, it's time to use it

Stargazer, you're not Frederick Douglass. You're not enslaved. You're not beaten. But you're job is the same. You have to follow majic, and evolve humanity past Darth Blockbuster and into the Digital Age.

Thankfully, we've already been doing it. We'll read how we won a battle in the story below. Once we understand how it's done, we'll be that much closer to winning the war and blowing up the Death Star.

## Inventing Adaptations - How humans evolve with technology and tools, b/c we know the difference between majic and rules, we can adapt faster

We've upgraded from one age to the next many times. There is a trend in the transformation. In biological evolution there are continual adaptations of existing lifeforms, and then sometimes fully new lifeforms. In Techvolution this is the difference between upgraded technology, and an entirely new tool.

Upgrading any technology is an iterative change, like going from sedan’s to SUV’s, VHS to DVD’s, tube TV’s to LCD’s. Each is different technologically, but they do the same job, so no new majic is needed to attract users. As a result, there's no political battles with any antagonists.

But when we’ve upgraded enough technologies, like microchips, touchscreens, batteries, and Wi-Fi, a genius can unlock a new tool like smartphones. And this requires new skills to learn, thus new majic to attract people to learn the new tool. When an extra decides to drop an old tool and reach for a new one a battle does start.

![New Tool Creation](/img\diagrams\techvolution-new-tool-creation-pc.png)

Why? Well, because creating a new tool asks a climactic and political question: who controls it? After all, whoever does, is more powerful. The weilder of the new tool can let extras connect with it to solve their problems. Or withold it and convince the extras to keep using old tools. Like muscle cars trying to keep customers away from Tesla with techniques like mass advertising, fancy auto shows, and spectacular chromes platedd V8 power! Because of how anti-evolutionary these these techniques are, I call them "dark majic".

Thus, while the story of civilization can be described as the struggle to overcome problems by upgrading technology and inventing new tools, it’s also about the battle to control them. The people with the old tool fight to retain their power, while inventors and innovators imagine a new society that shares it.

This is why the eternal story of civilization is protagonists making new tools, antagonists attacking new tools, and many extras watching them fight. Our politics is an ongoing history of technological change, with protagonist and antagonist both reaching to control the tool and make themselves the winner.

Today the extras lack self-awareness regarding their power to decide the battle’s outcome. When they do, they become and control society's player god. I’ll show you Stargazer, how important you are. Not too long ago, it was you who invented and implemented a new tool just by being curious and loving majic.

**Dark Majic**: Methods and techniques to keep a person using a tool for the benefit of the tool's controller and not the user.

# MID POINT

## A Techvolution Battle Scene - Wikipedia vs. Books, and an old philosophy

The environment keeps changing. Life needs to know how and uses its lifeforms to probe for answers. Similarly, the human environment keeps changing, and so humans also have to probe for answers. We ask questions like why are the movies so expensive, or more importantly what are proven techniques to stop malaria infections. We need a way to answer our questions and true to ourselves, we tackle this challenge by using our available technology to create a reference tool and upgrade it when possible.

Our first reference tool was the wisdom of our elders. The first technological upgrades were papyrus scrolls and ink (around 2300 BC) and books (around 300 BC), which turned some elders into experts like Hippocrates and Aristotle. When wood-pulp paper (1200) and the printing press (1456) were invented, humanity unleashed mass-produced books. Now experts could share knowledge between themselves and educate the masses. We called the reference books encyclopedias.

Encyclopedias were a massive hit; up until a generation or so ago, many households proudly included a physical encyclopedia collection in their library. _The Encyclopedia Britannica_ (1878) was the standard. In 1933 it started to be re-publihsed every to keep people updated to the latest facts. In the following decades, the computer, digital printer, and telecommunications meant encyclopedias were written and stored digitally. But they remained a set of printed books and CD’s controlled by experts.

Then came the world wide web (1991), a new technology that unlocked many new tools like websites, forums, blogs, and something called "wikis". Wiki software lets anyone write or edit a webpage by pressing "edit now". All changes are saved, so anyone can erase errors or vandalism by pressing "undo now". For years programmers used wikis to collaboratively write technical manuals.

As web tools boomed in the late ’90’s, protagonist Jimmy Wales wondered if the web could upgrade encyclopedias. Today, most of us who were curious about things like the movies or malaria know this story ends with a free online encyclopedia anyone can edit called Wikipedia. But it didn’t start out that way.

Wikipedia started as Nupedia (2000). Nupedia was a free online copycat of Encyclopedia Britannica where only "expert" professors made articles. Wikipedia (2001) was a side project. Only programmers knew "community content creation" would work.

Everyone else assumed regular people would only read the work of professors. The first issue with this theory was that the professors didn’t like to share their knowledge. In its first year, Nupedia had 12 articles. Wikipedia had 40,000, which most professors loved to belittle as rubbish. Professors even went further amd disallowed students from referencing Wikipedia’s articles in their school work. Yet professors refused to improve, or to assign students to improve, Wikipedia. By the way, the professors performed dark majic here. They tried, and still try, to convince people to not use a better product only because Wikipedia is free education.

The second issue was that it turned out "expert" answers and "regular" answers are the same. The movies are expensive because of a 1948 government rule banning studio’s working with theatres, which means they can't collaborate to lower prices. And mosquito nets are a simple and effective tool against malaria infections.

Thirdly, Wikipedia was so easy to use many extras became player god protagonists! A huge community of non-academics voluntarily shared their knowledge one "edit now" at a time and fiercely protected their common knowledge with "undo now". Nobody told them, paid them, or made a rule to force it. Because performing majic, and expanding someone else’s cyborgolgy with things like millions of Wikipedia articles, is Nature’s dopamine rush.

And lastly, so many people flocked to Wikipedia’s answers. The extra’s mass support quickly made Wikipedia king, while giving Nupedia and Encyclopedia Britannica quick deaths. Even though antagonists tried to stop it, notice how easily digital tools win when the peple are free to choose their own tools. Another reason Techvolution should be our ruling philosophy.

That’s the story of Wikipedia. Made by new protagonists, made the standard reference tool by empowered extras. Few believed it was possible, because even professors don’t understand new tools always unpower the few, to empower the rest. Interestingly, after I finally conceded temporary defeat to my personal Darth Blockbuster, I uploaded a few pages to Wikipedia instead. Not as helpful as my app, but it took just a few weeks of work, and one "edit now" button, to make it real. It felt majical to bypass the rules. It also put a smile on my face.

![Wikipedia development](/img\diagrams\techvolution-enclyclopedia-book-wiki.png)

## You Can Win - That's how a battle looks, now here's how the war looks, and don't worry, we've won this war before

So that's how we won a battle in the fight for the Digital Age. It's a battle that made me, and everyone else who write and read Wikipedia happy. Because evolving humanity puts smiles on our faces. The frequent excuses and rules in the way of evolution are made by old cyborgs, often perform dark majic to convince other people to keep using old tools that keep them rich.

Wikipedia’s victory teaches us to win the war. Imagine a world in which Main Street seeks new digital tools to solve their agonizing commutes, confusing loan contracts, rising home energy bills. Stargazer, that’s the story you must jump into with lightsabers a-blazin’, dicing up old evil storm-trooping tools, to supercharge humanity into the Digital Age.

Note however, our lives cut across thousands to millions of problems. Thus, our villains are not in a massive group like "the rich" or the "the unions" as old philosophies label. Our villains reveal themselves inside thousands of companies, institutions, and organizations, and they fight back by suppressing new tools to keep their version of the Encyclopedia Britannica or DVD alive.

This is the entire class of middle-men, consultants, managers, and executives who don't know the skills of their industry like nursing, teaching, and (definitely not) cleaning. Their power is to manage the gates of an Industrial Age technology.

Together, protagonists and extras can overcome these Darth Blockbusters to bring on the Digital Age. I know this is possible because history has proven it. Our struggle today was fought generations ago with Darth Blockbuster’s master: Darth King.

Darth King lived inside palaces, using society’s money to host splendid banquets and balls. His absolute power was hidden inside the Medieval Age's ruling philosophy of the nobility’s "divine right" to rule. Slowly, as protagonists invented scientific instruments, books, and guns, the Age of Enlightnment was born. With it came a new philosophy that valued philosophy, science, equality, and democracy. It was made the ruling philosophy Main Street became player gods in the American and French Revolutions. These revolutionaries were inspired by the new philosophy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

## Freeing Rousseau's Cinderella - We've defeated the Sith before, Darth King

"Player gods are born free; and everywhere they are in chains". Rousseau said that in 1762. Actually, he didn’t. But he would have, if he’d thought to label the people he was describing as "player gods" in a game. Rousseau was neither the king of France nor the richest man in England. Instead, he was a poor writer who copied sheets of music to make the rent. More than 300 years later, he is at last recognized as being a great philosopher, a political visionary, and a protagonist who helped free the world with his new philosophy.

Rousseau lived when kings and queens, dukes and duchesses ruled civilization. A time when Mozart played inside exquisite palaces during the nobility’s many banquets and balls. This was the opulence that had Cinderella dreaming her days away as she cleaned a dirty chateau. Sadly, unlike the fairy tale, the people didn’t have a fairy Godmother to make their dreams come true. Instead, the commoners cleaned the nobles’ vast libraries, used guns while dying in their wars, and were told to ignore what scientific instruments revealed. As extras in the story, they were excluded from the power of new tools because they believed their beloved Holy Bible said only Darth King had the "divine right to rule".

Rousseau called bullshit. In truth, Jesus was a carpenter, a commoner just like any other extra—you could argue—who rose to become the ultimate protagonist. Who is anyone to say other extras can’t live up to their own potential? Rousseau fought for the Age of Enlightenment. He believed that books, guns, and scientific instruments should liberate the extras who were only in chains for the happiness of con artists. The self-proclaimed "divine nobility" didn’t like hearing that. This powerful self-protecting community declared Rousseau a banquet-pooper, and chased him out of Switzerland, France, and England. Maybe that’s why Rousseau rented instead of owned.

It didn't matter. The nobility were in the dying days of their Mediavel Age power. Starting in 1776, within Rousseau’s lifetime, Darth King started to face the music when the American people started a revolution. One year after Rousseau died, the French had their own revolution in 1789. And on it went from country to country because Rousseau, and others like him, make the extras realize they should become player gods with an Age of Enlightenment ruling philosophy "of the people, for the people, by the people". Cinderella soon forgot about the fancy ball, and instead sung the music of freedom in a choir of equals, that sounded something like this:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/47E2tfK5QAg?start=5" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Revolutionary songs like this spread the people’s liberty, equality, and fraternity throughout the world. In a few years, the Medieval Age was finally gone, and civilization embraced the Age of Enlightenment with a new ruling philosophy. Now the nobles were no longer divine, but villains who resorted to hiring mercenaries to fight suppress Main Street. The party drunk nobles failed to realize that "their" people didn’t need them anymore.

When the people took control of books, guns, and science, they put presidents and senators, judges and sheriffs in power, who ruled at the request of the people who built a civilization of democracy, equality, and checks and balances, because no one was divine. A change empowered by tools, thought of in philosophy, yet made real with the bloodshed of revolutions on the frontline.

Rousseau died never having found a home. After they won their revolutions, a population of player gods put him to rest inside the glorious Panthéon, heralding him as a renowned breaker of chains, in a world of Enlightenment he helped build. Where any guy can be the prince, and any girl can be Cinderella.

The question for us is, how did Rousseau help an entire people embrace a new age, and change their ruling philosophy? I'd especially like to know how we do it better, because I’d really like to skip horrible revolutions.

## Society’s Three Stories - How we can judge our lives in real time (difference from majic?)

Entering a new age doesn't require an actual war. But brutal conflict is defintely the historical trend. To avoid conflict while entering the Digital Age, we have to see our society better than Rousseau did. We can only do that because we can learn from him.

Rousseau’s words echo this sentiment: let society enter into the Age of Enlightenment. Let the people prosper with new tools. Let the nobility return to their natural equality inside a democracy where anyone is free to be the the ruler if they can solve problems and thereby earn the public's approval and consent. Rousseau never said there shouldn't be leaders. He said leaders should earn their stop.

He didn't phrase it like this, but Rousseau made the people realize they needed to upgrade their societies ruling philosophy to the possibilities of an advancing civilization. When the people realized they didn't have to be so oppressed, the ruling philosophy of "divine leaders" looks so behind the times. This required change invoked a revolution, a sudden questioning of a civilization’s ruling philosophy. The American, French and all other such ensuing revolutions were so violent because the nobility had 1,000 years of "divinity" in their blood. They didn't understand with a new age, and "divinity" gave them many self-righteous excuses to keep the good times going.

A _Techvolution_ is different in the sense that it doesn’t require bloodshed or abrupt change; it mirrors evolutions, which tend to be more gradual and natural. Thus, to enable Techvolution, and rid the world of revolutions, we need a road map of tool development. Roadmaps can be sketched from the teachings of history, handed down to us through stories. It shouldn’t come as a big surprise that Rousseau was also a novelist.

Thus, Rousseau understood stories—not just fictional ones, but real-world ones, best explained the fabrication and inner workings of any society. He understood, too, that there are good and bad stories... and that each stems from a storyteller who has a very particular purpose. These stories are especially appealing to extras. And for that, if nothing else, you really should sit up and pay attention. Learning about stories will help you understand your own reality.

So let's explain stories. Every story contains a plot: a sequence of events where a protagonist fights an antagonist to overcome a problem. The fight to change reality happens in three parts. The first is the introduction of the problem and characters. The second is protagonist and antagonist thinking up plans and attacking each other. The third part is the conclusion, where we find out which side wins. Although it’s easier to see in some more than in others, all stories have this structure.

The difference between good and bad stories is how much it mixes things up to keep you in guessing what's going to happen next. While some bad stories are non-stop action scenes, and some stories are non-stop talking scenes, good stories mix the two up to tell a logical and surprisng story with a thick plot. Here are the three different kinds of stories.

<!-- input player gods. meaning to play the game well, is to tell a good story to the people inside it. even show an example of a revolution in Anno 1800 -->

**Classic movies:** are good stories with fights about real-life problems. Protagonist leave their typical day and personality, and challenge themselves to rise to the occasion and overcome a new found problem on behalf of humanity. Antagonists of course fight back.

Protagonist and antagonist repeatedly think of new ideas and act on them. Usually this means both characters fight to create and control tools to make themselves the winner of the back and forth battle.

Mixing logical problem solving, with new ideas, gives classic stories "logical surprises". These plot twists make what’s going to happen next unknown and keeps audiences glued to their seats. The conclusion can anything from a big victory for the good or bad guys, or anywhere in between.

There’s no way to know which stories will resonate with audiences, but only good stories can resonate with audiences and become classics like _Cinderella_, _Romeo and Juliette_, _The Matrix_, and _Star Wars_. These stories are often archetypes like "Rags to Riches" or "Forbidden Love" that are so natural they exist in all cultures and religions in some way, and hence why they reasonate so well for people living life on the frontline.

**Art films:**- are not about any specific problem. The film is more of a personal journal about not overcoming problems, for example personal loneliness, or hating ones job. The main character is thus selfish and self-important. Not because they do not take on a problem, but because they want to be the protagonist even though they aren't leading the way for others to follow.

Because their heroes don't take on problems and fight off antagonists, art stories end up with lots of talking scenes, usually with the main character talking about themselves and how much they wish they could solve their problem.

The result is films with no action, that fill their time showcasing idiosyncratic behavior, and storylines with no problem solving to logically tie events together. Without action, these stories are surprising to the point of being weird, with conclusion that never change the reality because the hero didn’t even try to.

Without logical surprises, art films need to get weirder and weirder to maintain interest. To insulate themselves from criticism art filmmakers usually give themselves awards, grandeur, and titles and end up-like their protagonists-on stages talking about themselves in a bout of self-gratification. Film festivals like Cannes, Sundance, Toronto mainly show art films.

**Spectacle movies:**- are about an obvious problem, i.e. Godzilla is here, so run like hell and keep running until the movie is over. Spectacle movies are thus very logical because the problem is very simple; survive or die. However, since the action is so instinctual, there’s no time for the protagonist to think of new ideas. The result is very logical but unsurprising stories.

To maintain interest, spectacle movies have to keep reusing successful stories and characters while ramping up special effects, gore, and raunchiness. It doesn’t work for too long, so spectacle producers look for new customers with hype-filled mass marketing campaigns. Most franchise movies, sequels, and remakes are spectacle movies.

![All three stories!](/img\diagrams\techvolution-all-stories.png)

In storytelling, logic and surprises counter-balance each other. Withholding the logic solving a problem makes self-important art films, and withholding surprises makes simple spectacle movies. Classic stories are good because they mix the two and create "logical surprises" that open our minds and change things. This is why art/spectacle stories don’t have "spoilers", while we want to "go in fresh" for classic stories.

You can see the difference in your favorite sitcom such as _The Office, Seinfeld, Friends, HIMYM, The Big Bang Theory_. They start off as classic stories, with characters who actively deal with relatable problems like not liking their jobs or being tired of dating. We see ourselves in these characters, which is why we cry, laugh, and all that when regular everyday stuff happens to them, because we know it could also happen to us.

However, in later seasons, to keep their now popular characters alive, the sitcoms keep them living the same stories. Kramer can’t get a job, Raj can’t get a girl, Dwight can’t get self-aware. Here sitcoms become art and spectacle stories. Art, as in these characters don't learn to overcome their personal problems. And, spectacle, because we the audience keep watching even though we already know what’s going to happen. We watch our favorite actors, characters, sets, catch-phrases, instead of waiting for logical surprises. You keep watching only because you've grown accustomed to them.

Rousseau noticed society has these classic, art, and spectacle stories, and that human society’s travel through them as they do in long-running sitcoms. Rousseau also noticed how one story works for equality and democracy, and the other two work to enrich the artists and distract the masses.

![Classic heroes](/img\diagrams\techvolution-protagonist-comparison.png)

## The Politics of Stories - this is what we learned from the last time, so we can chart our course

So these are the three categories in a nutshell. Classic heroes tackle real-life problems. Art heroes are self-obsessed. Spectacle heroes are a distraction.

Their purpose and meaning do not end there. In the world of politics, this means the ruling philosophy of classic stories are about equality and democracy that solves real-life problems, while a ruling philosophy art and spectacle stories are about maintaining a hierarchy that avoid real-life frontline problems.

In which category would you classify The Matrix? This story depicts a dystopian future in which most of humanity is unknowingly trapped inside a simulated 1990’s reality called the matrix. It’s created by machines to distract humans while using their bodies as an energy source. Neo, the protagonist who was once a mere extra, is recruited to help the few untapped humans’ rebel against the machines. His job is to make the sleeping masses inside the matrix realize their reality is fake.

This story is basically majic vs. the rules. Neo wants the masses to realize the matrix’s rules are bullshit. When they do, they can remove the plug, and re-learn the majic of using their own tools to live a free life.

The machines antagonist, Agent Smith, can control much of the matrix, but not all of it. Enforcing the rules of the ruling philosophy of slavery, makes "the agents" bound to its rules too. Neo has a new ruling philosophy of freedom. Thus, he isn’t bound by the matrix’s rule book. A freedom he wants to teach others.

Neo takes on the machines. Unbound by its ruling philosophy, he learns to manipulate the matrix better and better. He jumps higher, runs faster, and soon dodged bullets. The machines, unable to match his wisdom, fight back with dark majic.

They get one of the freed humans to turn on Neo and his supporters. Not with the allure of power, but with the allure of going back into the comfortable matrix. The familiar spectacle of Rolling Stone concerts, television sitcoms, and V8 engines is all this modern Judas wants. The traitor knows its fake, but will accept it because "ignorance is bliss". The machines agree to give this to him, so they can forever stay on top.

The traitor losses. Neo is too powerful. In the final battle with Agent Smith, he not only can dodge bullets, but stop them in mid-air. He completely sees past the "spectacle" of items that the traitor said was "bliss", and only sees the matrix’s code, and can thus rewrite it as he wants. Neo soon kills the agents, calls the machines, and says:

  >I came here to tell you how this is going to begin. I'm going to hang up this phone. And then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world without you. A world without rules and controls, without border or boundaries A world where anything is possible. Where we go from there, is a choice I leave to you.

Since this is a classic story, once Nero’s done freeing the people, him and his friends return to being equal members of the free community. Neo’s hierarchy of support was temporary, being based on solving a frontline problem. Perhaps he’ll be the hero of the next story, but maybe not. It depends on the problem and who the people want to be their problem solving hero to be. Regardless by stepping up, Neo can continue being the protagonist of his own life, by deciding who he'll follow, not letting the agents decide for him.

Spectacle and art stories do not solve frontline problems. Thus, their hierarchies can go on for as long as their storytellers can convince people to watch them, or live inside them. These storytellers, who are the leaders, are self-important, self-involved, who can’t solve problems, and the masses are just like the people stuck inside the matrix; distracted from the truth with a world of spectacle like shiny cars, copyrighted music, 9-5 work days, and sitcom re-runs, which people stay attached to via dark majic of advertisements, marketing, and loyalty to an old culture.

This is the harsh reality of majic. The real-world in the matrix is cold, dark, and damp. Neo must convince the people living in freedom inside this unpleasant reality is better than the tyranny of a pleasant fiction full of the spectacle and dark majic.

The longer the spectacle lasts, the longer the self-important artists, like Darth King, and Darth Blockbuster, can go on living inside self-obsessed stories. They’re happy with the way things are. They want to be heroes atop the hierarchy forever.

But like an aging sitcom, it never lasts. Eventually the people’s problems pile up, and they soon need a true hero again. That means a hero who can see through the spectacle of the ruling philosophy, and lead the people to a new society that distributes the powers of modern tools to humanity can starting solving problems an evolving again. It's better for everyone when the people rise up before a bloody revolution hits. Hence when Techvolution is so much better to fight for.

The lesson is this Stargazer. Whether living inside a story, or looking at one, we can tell the difference betweed classic, art, and spectacle by looking at how new tools are treated. Classic stories embrace new tools because they solve problems. Art stories dislike new tools because they force self-obsessed main characters to step up or step away from the limelight. And spectacle loves new tools but uses them to ramp up the spectacle so the masses don't ask for the power themselves; like when Darth Blockbuster rented digital effects filled movies but didn't want us to stream them.

So let's use our understanding of stories, to understand the political philosophy of our societies.

**Good ruling philosophy**: Meant to facilitate the creation and distribution of new tools. It's lead by individuals selected by the people, who rise to the occasion to become protagonists. Once their spectific problem is over, leaders willfully returns to being an equal member of the community.

**Bad ruling philosophy**: Meant to withhold the creation and especially distribution of new tools. Led by leaders who don't want to empower the people or and return to equality. Instead hey distract the masses from their unearned, and increasingly self-serving leadership, with spectacle.

## Neo Douglass - The people act when they see the matrix

The story of the matrix is a common one. Most oppressed peoples could sympathize with it. Frederick Douglass certainly could. Mister Auld was the agent of slavery, Douglass the hero responsible for waking himself and everyone else up. And Sophia is the masses, the extras, who must choose between majic and the rules.

Dougless and Rousseau were each the Neos of their times. They both woke people up to the reality that self-indulgent art and distracting spectacle, when used to enrich the rich and distract the masses, are bullshit, and society should focus on solving real-life problems by empowering people with tools. Real heroes fight for this individual empowerment, and when done let their hierarchies melt away into the free soil of equality.

Telling the difference between a true hero like Douglass, whose given political power from the people so he can win them greater freedom, and selfish heroes, who simply take political power and keep it for themselves is hard. To most easily tell the difference, we need to analyze the story we're in. Is it a classic one, or a art and spectacle one. For his part, Rousseau defeated Darth King, by making the people realize they were watching spectacular re-runs while the nobility was in exquisite banquets and balls.

![Classic heroes](/img\diagrams\techvolution-battle-douglass.png)

## Protagonist Kings - There is a time for growth and extras

Not all kings are con artists. We remember Medieval Time fondly in childhood stories of gallant knights for good reason. These kings were the heroes of a classic story because they defeated monsters to create a peaceful country for people to live in.

In Rousseau’s time "holy" noble families ruled every European country. But they were in power because of their ancestors. After western Rome fell in 476 western Europe entered the Dark Ages (500-1000). So called because there was no books, ink, or literate people to write anything down. Nor was there much else, like sanitation, military, judicial systems. Civilization was gone. Anarchy ruled. The Dark Ages sucked.

People like Clovis I, Charles Martel, and Alfred the Great took charge. They were master warriors who uses swords, bows, armor, and cavalry to fight off invaders. Even better, they headed large families who kept some peace. They built castles to protect the newly remade wells, hospitals, and markets.

This was a classic story because a hero saw a real-life problem, was determined to change it, rallied supporters, and fought the evil villains. Fittingly, a hierarchy formed around society’s use of Medieval's Europe primitive tools. We call it feudalism. You’ve probably seen it in Robin Hood, Vikings, or Game of Thrones. Feudalism was a rigid hierarchy of kings, bishops, dukes, sheriffs, knights, priests, tradesman, and peasants. In return for loyalty, the people got what was called the "King’s peace", which slowly let the people update their cyborgolgy with shovels, oxen, thatched houses, buckets, sickles, and other tools.

The people happily declared the leaders holy, because the country's stability was vested into the heroes own person. They were basically like mafia bosses. These kings didn't rule inside a official parliament or bureucracy. Like a Odysseus, Robin Hood, or Neo they were themselves were protagonists; making them Protagonist Kings. This was the start of the "noble divine right to rule".

Since society had no political institutions like dependable judicial systems, standing police force, or governmental departments, the personal rule of the nobility was definitely holy, for if they disappeared, so did the political peace keeping millions of peasants safe.

Under the rule of Protagonist Kings, Western Civilization rebuilt poltical instituions like court systems, town councils, sanitation departmnets. But it was slow going. By the time Western Europe had a fully functioning civilization again, (around the Renaissance depending on how you define it) nobody could remember why the story of divine nobility started. Who could blame them, there's more time betweem us and Galileo, then to them and the fallen Roman Empire.

As Europe went through the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the invaders were increasingly gone, the water was running, the roads were clean, the markets were busy. The once Protagoinst Kings, were now merely executives of a very large, bureaucractic governments. The only thing that didn't change was the culture of noble divinity. The leaders had the title of king, but were not protagonists. They instead were villains protecting their privledge, who refused to let society grow out of the "nobles divine right to rule", and became Antagonist Kings.

## Antagonist Kings - growth/heirarchy/extras are temporary, people get their lives back inside ecosystems

During the Renaissance nobility was established as a divine right or a hereditary gift. The nobles were no longer military leaders fighting off Vandals, Vikings, and brigands, but simply born with "noble blood". They only waged war against each other, and usually only for personal glory. But otherwise they sat atop a hierarchy who paid no taxes, did no work, and answered to no one. The nobles used relative peace and prosperity to replace armor with dresses, churches with cathedrals, castles with palaces, and battlefields with banquets and balls.

Loving life, and without opposition, these nobles conned the people, and themselves, with art and spectacle. They lived inside an self-important art culture, where ever more self-importance, eccentricity, gossip, and titles, was the norm. And they distracted the people with spectacle to watch. Brilliant cathedrals, palaces, and wars against other kingdoms to keep the masses occupied. Like franchise movies, all these spectacles got more intense to keep the story interesting.

Visit European classic castles and extravagant palaces, modest churches and brilliant cathedrals, and you’ll see the transformation civilization had from classic stories to spectacle in Europe’s buildings. Compare the clothes of armored clad Charles Martel, and the dress wearing Louis XIV, and you’ll see the transformation from function to art.

During this transformation frontline problems piled up for the people. Their situation barely changed, and arguably got worse, from 1000 to 1778. Their houses were still thatched. They still used hand tools. They still paid almost all the taxes. They were still banned from advancing in official society. Feudalism became a caste system controlled by con artists who are rightfully called Darth King because they fought against natural equality and distributing the power of new tools to the people.

In short, Darth King told themselves they were literally sent from God, and thus they were main characters whose leading role status should thus never end. The practical reason for noble divinity, fighting off anarchy, was ignored. The nobles lost the plot of their own stories. They held their people back from learning and adopting new tools. It sent Darth King's civilizations into revolutions, and cost him his head.

![Revolutions!](/img\diagrams\techvolution-martel-louis.png)

## Repeat Story - We also had growth/heirarchy/extras, and now we get our lives back/ecosystems

I'm not sure if you know this Stargazer, but the Devil was once an angel named Lucifer. He lived with God up in the clouds with the rest of the heavenly beings. Rejecting God's commands, Lucifer grew vain and greedy and actually the supremacy of God. God thrown Lucifer down from Heaven to be the dark lord of hell.

That's not all. Free from the restrictions of justice, fairness, and good, Lucifer can assume any form, and be anyone, at any time. The Devil can live within us all, because all humanity is tainted with the greed to be think they can be gods.

At least that's the Christian tale of good versus evil. I'm sure many religions share a similar story. It's definitely been echoed throughout Wester literature. Lord Voldermort, Lord Sauron, and Lord Vader were all once heroes. Each grew evil as they were unwilling to give back their power when corrupted by evil ambitions of lifelong supremacy. It's probably so common in literature because it's so common in humanity; power often corrupts.

This same story happened to kings of Europe. It's repeating itself in our modern times as well. Our antagonists are also fallen heroes.

It’s important to note, while Rousseau’s followers may have been political free, they were economically poor. Hunger, disease, unemployment, illiteracy, were all rampant. The time was basically one of "economic anarchy". This is when "red/blue" philosphies, bent on political liberation from kings and economic liberation from poverty, were born.

Like how society loved the original kings for winning the "King’s peace", the original economic kings were heroes for winning massive economic growth that won the "Executive's prosperity. They said follow me, recognize my property rights, let me run the economy, my company’s will keep you employed and improve your life with new tools like lightbulbs, stoves, and telephones.

Slowly but surely, they did. They told a good story during the Industrial Revolutions The people were again a happy audience helped humanity overcome economic anarchy. And we did that with many of the primitive tools of today. Schools, colleges, and universities educated the masses. Gas trucks and cars moved resources and products much faster. Oil and coal powered everything.

Darth Blockbuster’s forebears like Andrew Carnegie, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Louis B. Mayer, did what Clovis I and the rest did. And like how Darth King was only exposed when new tools empowered the extras so they didn’t need to be peasants anymore, Darth Blockbuster was only revealed when digital tools were so powerful, the extras didn’t need to be 9-5 working consumers anymore.

Using Western European history as an example, this story of heroes leading society against political anarchy and then centures later economic anarchy are both stories of fallen angels. Stories that went from being classics, to art and spectacle.

The political story ended with centuries of violent revolutions. There was no other way to get the power of modern tools from the undeserving self-important leaders.

That should both worry you and make you happy Stargazer. First the worrying part; Darth Blockbuster defends primitive tools because he controls them. He surrounds himself with story of self-importance, and distracts the people with spectacle. John Wayne noticed this started, not surprisingly, in the 1970’s for movies:

>Now the goddamned stock manipulators have taken over. They don't know a goddamned thing about making movies. They make something dirty, and it makes money, and they say, 'Jesus, let's make one a little dirtier, maybe it'll make more money.' And now even the bankers are getting their noses into it.

This same story happened throughout the suburban "American Dream". Detached homes got ever more specular, McMansions, designer kitchens. Cars got bigger, more size, more chrome, more horsepower. Televisions increase in size. Food portions increased, sugar was added to everything. Rather than transform society to the capabilties of digital tools, Darth Gas Cars, Darth Telephone, Darth Sugar made their tools more spectular.

The good news is, where not at a revolutionary let's burn down society point yet. We can transition to a new story ourselves. And everyone benefits, because all art/spectacle stories eventually end, so we have a deadline we all should want to never see. And to beat that dead horse, we can take the initiative if we see that tools, and the freedom to use them as we want, is the most important political right and responsibilty of our lives.

But before we get to that, there’s something else. Something that’s gone very wrong...

# ACT THREE

## Breaking News - List of all problems, startingin 1970's, because we didn't adapt to a new age. Collaboration is needed, and held back, time to act Stargazer

I'm not perfect. Far from it. Johnny Majic is just a regular guy. For whatever reason I've always been pretty good at retaining knowledge and analyzing history and politics. But I can't do math in my head, nor a million other things.

If the antagonists think this is wrong, they'll create a rule. If that doesn't work, they'll attack the messenger. So let's get this over with. What rule did I break? I downloaded a movie from the pirate bay. You think that was that wrong?

## The Rules Said to Rent DVD's Forever - we can adapt proactively, we either had to take it or.. wait, no we didn't

It's amazing to think about, but think about this everytime you watch Netflix today, was once watched after driving to pickup a DVD.

DVD's were a major revenue stream for movies. Heck people were filling their basements of DVD's. In 2008, hackers put together BitTorrents. A technology that spliced files into tiny bits, and let people share their content. It was an amazing new tool, that was most often used to distribute songs and movies. The studio's saw the record companies fall to Napster and adopt iTunes, but didn't learn from the lesson.

I don't want to actually personalize anyone as "Darth Blockbuster" (especially if I never met them). But it might be a good idea for you to take a minute and visit YouTube and search around for "movie piracy" documentaries. It was once a hot topic and news broadcasters did lots of reports about losing the movies to the doom of BitTorrents.

The big concern was loss of of revenue. From their perpective DVD sales kept the industry afloat. Replacing them with streaming, especially illegal streaming, was in their eyes people sneaking into the movie en masse. And this wasn't just an industry problem. The movies are the cultural backbone of the world. They need to be protected.

Thus, they called movie downloaders pirates. Even though most had been loyal customers for generations, all of a sudden these same people were thieves and criminals.

Luckily I was a usher and projectionist in a movie theatre around this time. When added to some history and analysis, we get to peak behind the curtain of the movie industry.

## Technological History of the Movies - Using what weve learned

Assuming you tried, it's funny how easy it was to find Darth Blockbuster on YouTube. Now, I need to know how movies and television technologically evolved. This would take weeks at a library. But I have Wikipedia so it'll take a few hours. Rubbish indeed professors.

So let's go.

The first thing to understand, is movies didn't invent stories. We've always, and always will, tell stories. They help us understand our lives and societies. Religious sermons, epic poetry, and stage plays have filled our need of stories throughout the years.

The movies, and later television, are merely tools that help tell stories. Each is a creation of three pieces of technology. Data transmission, data storage, and data viewing. Movies started in 1894 when Thomas Edison’s laboratory invented the kinetoscope; the first machine that moved pictures through a light source fast enough to give the impression of seamless movement. Hence the name "moving pictures", simplified as "movies".

The kinetoscope was like a vending machine for movies. Customers looked through a peep hole to see clips of boxing matches or dance routines. It was a popular novelty, kind of like GIFs on Instagram. Edison owned the patents and created the New Jersey based Motion Picture Patent Corporation (MPPC) to make sure everyone in the young movie industry paid their dues.

After a few years of MPPC’s interference and legal threats, in what amounted to shakedowns, movie companies moved to Los Angeles to get away. As new projector technology came, MPPC lost its patent monopoly anyway. The movie industry was free to grow in LA’s good weather, cheap land, and no stifling East Coast corporate hierarchies.

And best yet technology kept improving. New projectors could show movies on huge screens. Although reels weren’t long enough yet to show long movies. With the new projectors, movie theaters called Nickelodeons (because admission cost a nickel) opened up across the country. The movies were still novelties, showing exotic animals, news reels, or sports highlights, but getting better, like Instagram stories, instead of GIFs.

By the 1920’s film reels were long enough to show three act stories. Although sound still wasn’t synched with film, so movies had subtitled dialogue and theatres used live music bands to communicate emotions.

In 1927 film was finally synchronized with sound, giving movies dialogue and music. For the first time in history, full stories were not limited to a physical theatre. Any movie theatre in the world could show any story. A new storytelling tool was thus created.

Like Instagram or Netflix popularity today, the people certainly felt the magic of good storytelling, and the majic of needing the theatre. No longer a novelty, the movies attracted millions every week. American industry rushed to control the booming industry. American culture was told on the silver screen. Leading actors became cultural icons. The industry exploded with profits. Although the people controlled none of it, their interest and loyalty made it happen one movie ticket at a time.

Of course, all the technology that made the movie industry so rich and powerful was physical. Data storage, transport, and viewing was physical film, light projectors, and delivery trucks.

This didn’t change until a new tool was born in 1948. Televisions used a different mixture of technologies. Huge magnetic tape reels stored content. Radio transmitted content over the airwaves. And televisions received the transmissions, and displayed the content on tube televisions.

Broadcasts television companies like NBC, ABC, and CBS, now competed with movie theatres. TV story quality wasn’t as good, but the convenience was huge; especially as Americans slowly moved away from the cities packed with movie theatres into the suburbs packed with TV’s.

From the 1950’s to the early 1980’s nothing much changed in the entertainment industry. Movies and television got better technologies. Film reels got clearer, color, and widescreen. Likewise, televisions got bigger and bandwidth improved with cable. But no new tools were created. The people still couldn’t choose or produce their own content.

Then came new tools. The magnetic tapes databases that stored TV broadcasters’ content, got small enough to make home video cassette recorder (VCR). VCR’s cut out the broadcaster, who of course sued the manufacturer Sony for letting people break the rules and "time shift" television shows. The case ended up in the Supreme Court in 1984.

In a 5-4 vote the power to record and watch videos was distributed to the people; the extras were free to add the VCR to their cyborgology. VCRs, home cameras, and renting movies became very popular in the late 1980’s. The most successful video rental company took the name "Blockbuster", the common term for popular movies. The entertainment industry quickly forgot about its VCR objections, and gladly put its content on Blockbuster’s busy shelves.

Home entertainment tools kept getting better. In the late 1990’s came DVD’s and flat screen televisions. DVD’s were more advanced CD’s, and worked like videotapes, except they were digital. Meaning data was stored as "1 or 0". Plasma or LCD flat screens televisions were much bigger than tube televisions, and since they were digital too, they were High Definition.

Even more people rushed to upgrade their cyborgology with DVD’s and home theatres. Blockbuster rental stores were even busier, especially as people started buying hundreds of DVD’s for home libraries. The entertainment industry loved it. They didn’t even care movie theatre attendance dropped heavily and many went bankrupt. In fact, they started to use theatres as marketing hype. The money was in DVD sales.

Yet they didn’t notice, that the data transmission, data storage, and data viewing technologies of the movie industry was now almost entirely digital.

Except movie distribution. People still had to drive to pick up their DVD’s or less likely visit a movie theatre. Hence, people still needed to concentrate around movie theatres, rental stores, or TV guides (i.e. the castles with gatekeepers), to access their digital data.

Until they didn’t.

The internet, the transfer of digital information that was used for email and webpages since the 1970’s, had kept getting better and faster. And in the early 2000’s the internet got High Speed, and could finally transfer 1’s and 0’s of a DVD faster then someone driving to pick one up.

And here enters The Pirate Bay (2003). Like Napster, it introduced digital movies to people first. Although the entertainment industry used digital cameras, film projectors, email, webpages, YouTube for years, they didn’t want people using a new tool, but to keep using their profitable DVD technology; they even made two new ones called Blu-Ray (2006) and HD-DVD (2006).

The people wanted the better tool. The one that made their life more profitable. After all the countless hours needed to invent new digital tools was mostly done on their tax dollars in government labs and military funding and university institutions. Pirate Bay was the first to offer the new technology as a new tool to the people. It was a pain, it was hard to learn, but it was better than driving.

Remember the industry called this people thieves! Customers are pirates! People are evil, people are cheap, people are thieves! Really? Then explain the graph below, the one what shows how the evil people responded with protagonist Reed Hastings in 2005 made a new internet tool and gave internet movies to the people. What we call Netflix, by 2009, when Hollywood was panicking about BitTorrents, the people were finally given internet streaming. This was the same fucking time as Darth Blockbuster and the industry was complaining about human evolution.

If middle class Americans and Canadians are pirates, why didn’t Blockbuster stores have steel bars? The same reason why we don’t steal Netflix. Blockbuster was a fair deal, until data streaming movies was possible. Then Netflix was.

The people elected to download movies from pirate bay because it was an upgrade available to their cyborgology. The only natural rule is natural selection. When people choose the best tool, they evolve into better cyborgs. It’s not the people’s job to wait for an industry to catch up to Nature. It should be the other way around.

Maybe the industry would have noticed that. Instead, they were too busy surrounding themselves with art and wanted people to being distracted with spectacle (Blu-Ray, HD-DVD). While calling their own customer’s thieves, the movie industry held countless banquets and balls on the people’s DVD dollars; movie premieres, talk shows, award shows, and launch parties. Read books like Hollywood Interrupted and the revelation of the #MeToo movement, and these parties were, never mind self-congratulatory, but often even evil.

The industry became self-obessed artists patting themselves on the back for making every weirder films, while manufacturing cheap spectacle to distract the masses. The masks of royalty appeared again. Success wasn't defined by those on the frontline, but by politicking and ingratiating oneself to the putrid politics of a aged industry.

The Oscars, Correspondence Dinners, Emmy’s, Golden Globes, Cannes Film Festival, Sundance Film Festival, Toronto International Film Festival, and so many others. All modern version of banquets and balls, with gates to keep you out, and rules put in place to make the good times of the DVD going. Party loving, profit loving, foresight lacking is a recipe for antagonism, hence Darth Blockbuster rose up.

While the spectacle of Blu-Ray and HD-DVD tricked some extras, like with Wikipedia attracting people despite the supposed experts objections, the vast majority followed the natural majic of online movie streaming instead, even when it was against the rules to improve society.

Digital tools empowered the extras to fight back, and check his self-important art story. Nevermind that the people flocked to HBO and Netflix not only for the better technology and value, but because these companies emulated early Hollywood and told classic stories like _The Sopranoes_, _Breaking Bad_, and _Game of Thrones_. The people sought out these products.

In short, the movie industry was led by people who didn't know how to tell stories. They re-used past hits to squeeze as much out of the glory days as possible. Hence, so many movies were sequals and remakes that were simply bad stories.

The artists inside the industry got back at them with a system of "one for them, one for me" and made increasingly weired, unenjoyable, and politically charged art films.

Here's the frontline difference between spectacle/art, and classic stories.

If rying to make people shake in their seats by adding a motor isn't bullshit... So the people revolvted to new leaders. Heroes that used modern tools to do a good job and tell quality stories.

Techvolution tells them its right to do it. As for it being against the rules, it was, but the rules weren't updated to digital tools so who cares.

As for me. I was naive back then and never downloaded any movies. I was the sucker buying DVD’s.

Hey, do you think Darth Blockbuster will buy back all those DVDs, Blu-Rays, and HD-DVDs he told me, and us, was better than downloading? I wonder did those go up, or down, in value?

## Evolution Doesn't Happen Without Fighting - Main street has to act

Can't make up your mind. This will help. The force is strong with whoever holds digital tools. And that by design. The thousands of protagonists who built digital tools wanted to empower individual people like you.

The very foundation of the internet is based on the rock-solid value of individual empowerment. And this fact means Darth Blockbuster never did, and never will, stand a chance against today’s internet Jedi.

## Darth King Charles - Main Street Tried to be Patient - antagonists don't leave their stories

Antagonists may be well intentioned, but they’ll never change their minds. Indeed, the problems we’re having in our world right now, new powerful tools being witheld from the people's hands by the leaders of old ruling philosophies, has happened before. Let’s go back the ruling philosophy of the noble’s divine right, see how it all worked out for Darth King Charles.

When Rousseau was being chased around Europe in the 1760-70’s, King Louis XVI rule France and King George III ruled England. Both faced revolutions inspired by the pain on the frontline their high-spending lifestyles and government mismanagement caused. However, these weren’t the first kings to face revolts.

Before Rousseau explained frontline problems to the people, the people still revolted against noble’s excesses and incompetent leadership. Among the first to face the people’s wrath was King Charles I, who ruled England from 1625-1649.

Charles ruled as an absolute monarch under the "nobles right to rule" ruling philosophy. England had a Parliament but it was supposed to advise the king and not tell him what to do. After some revolts in the Middle Ages, parliament did however earn the power to approve taxes.

After years of his forebears mismanaging government finances and overspending himself, Charles needed money. The people and their parliament refused to say yes until they got more political powers. Charles refused to talk to them. Instead he sent parliament home, and ruled by himself for 10 years. He raised taxes by using some very old feudal rules. One retroactively fined some men for not showing up to Charles’ coronation 10 years earlier. Charles’ version of the fine print didn’t endear him to the people.

Parliament eventually got sick of this subversion, raised an army, and fought the English Civil War (1642–1646). The army was local men devoted to their parliament. Its officers were chosen by merit, while Charles’s men were mostly nobles who hired mercenaries to fight for them. The war between "parliamentarians" and "loyalists" was so bad it inspired the saying that life without a working government is "nasty, brutish, and short".

After four years Charles lost. He was held under arrest, while rules for a "constitutional monarchy" were being made by the Parliamentarians. But then Charles escaped, hired a new army, and fought the Second English Civil War (1648–1649).

Charles lost again. The victorious Parliamentarians were now enraged. They forgot about a constitutional monarch and charged Charles for crimes against the English people. While they didn’t have a new ruling philosophy, the people were at least questioning the one in power.

Charles didn’t budge. The rules were on his side. The Bible said he was God’s representative on Earth. He was the natural leader the same way a father is the leader of his children. Which is why Charles refused to speak the court; a father doesn’t answer to his children.

But then Darth King Charles did speak, and that fact, showcases how set the Sith are in their stories.

## Charles Speaks - The Proof is in the Words

Charles had a speech impediment. Often called a stammer or studder. No one then, or even now, understands what causes it. It's a piece of biological cyborgology that doesn't work properly. A person can talk fine when alone or with pets, there's sometimes a mental block in the mind when people are around.

That’s because for a stutterer, talking is like playing guitar with music notes written on the fly by a gremlin. Some words are easy to say, some are difficult hard, and some decide which at the last mili-mili-mili-second. The stutterer must jump around the words in real time. Fail and you miss a — beat.

But a stutter isn’t just about pauses, repetitions, or missing beats in a sentence. Stuttering is like having a mini-seizure. Your body seizes. Your neck tenses. You stop breathing. It’s horrible. I should know, because I suffer  from the same affliction as Charles did.

The physical pain isn’t even the worst. Getting that look from people is. The "what the fuck is wrong with you?" look.

_"Hello, my ~~name~~ I’m Charles. I wa-want can want to ~~help~~ discuss, the situation with the, ~~Parliament~~ House of Commons…"_

The prospect of talking, except to yourself and a dog, which Charles had two of, causes huge anxiety. The idea of never conversing with anyone causes huge loneliness and depression. The King’s Speech showed it well. Stuttering usually forces a person to be shy, passive, eager to please, and come up with weird reasons for their erratic speaking like hand gestures, random silence, binge drinking, and swear words (which, like talking to yourself or dogs, for some reason never cause a stutter). It’s entirely possible Charles’ relationship with Parliament was so bad because he simply didn’t want to talk with them. Not that he would ever admit he had an impediment. After all, he was a king!

My speech impediment was the reason I got a job in a car insurance claim department. After a vice president at an old company secretly told my supervisor I wasn’t allowed to talk to customers, for fear of embarrassing the company, I was like shit I guess I don’t have this damn gremlin under control. I wasn’t even that mad about it (although I was that it was an open secret for over a year). I never told anyone I had the impediment, so despite therapy as a kid, it was obviously still a problem.

So, fuck it. I decided to jump in the ocean and sink or swim. A car insurance claim call-center for a stutterer is like swimming the open ocean. A daily workout of all-day phone calls, angry drivers, customer service expectations, no "outs" like swear words, drinking games, or wonky behavior to hide behind. I was like that drowning desert fox learning to swim telling myself; "I’m getting better!".

And it was far worse than I thought. The insurance company wanted adjusters to answer ever more phone calls. To incentive us, they’d ring a monotone "bell" because… I don’t know.  They never said why, we employees learned questioning "the bell" was a bad idea. Management used it as punishment; "answer more phone calls or we’ll make the bell faster and louder!".

I’m being serious by the way. We were often more stressed then the person who just had a car crash. Whatever the reason, DING-DING-DING-DING almost all day, which gave people who weren’t stutterers huge anxiety, breakdowns, and stress leaves.

Super-shock speech therapy! After about a year I didn’t have to massage my jaws at night to release it from all the teeth shattering jaw-clenches I did to divert vocal stuttering. I was cured!

The point is this. That’s what it took for me to mostly never stutter (except when people try to limit my word choices in pretentious situations). It’s like night and day. The anxiety washed away. A hidden outgoing personality was brought out and frankly is fun, although still surreal, to be.

Yet Charles never had this lesson. Despite being adamant he was God’s chosen leader (or perhaps because of it), he was famously shy and quiet his whole life because that’s the gremlin likes it. Even when fighting for 16 years defending his ruling philosophy, Charles still probably had to massage his strained jaws every night. I can sympathize. The gremlin is an asshole.

Charles would have to talk. He was accused of being "a Tyrant, A Traitor, Murderer, and a public enemy to the Commonwealth of England". The people weren't replacing one king for another, and therefore staying loyal to the ruling philosophy of divie nobility. They were saying the leader of their country was a bad ruler, supposing they had a say who rules them. This idea is the origin of the king in the title image, the one the Jedi and Darth Vader are fighting over. That king represents the "state" which is exists from a social contract with the people, not because of divine right to rule.

Because a ruler of a state can be a king, a consul, a prime minister, or a president. Thus, Charles wasn’t only defending his life, but the ruling philosophy that says the nobles are above the people.

The prosecutors didn’t have Rousseau’s new ruling philosophy to replace the "divine rights of nobles". They simply said Charles was a tyrant and asked for the death penalty. Charles still wouldn’t speak. He didn’t believe his life was on the chopping block. Kings don’t answer to children.

Charles wasn’t pretending or bluffing. He wasn’t proud, or stubborn. He psychologically couldn’t understand even the idea of being wrong. Like an antagonist, he lived in a different story with a different ruling philosophy. One that made him the hero.

The judges convicted Charles anyway. He was sentenced to death by removing the head from the body. Charles was flabbergasted and now wanted to speak in his defense. The next chance would be standing at his own chopping block.

Fuck the ringing bell of a claims department, imagine that stress of a stutterer minutes from execution, having to say something to justify 16 years of civil war.

Charles only had words to justify himself, and the ruling philosophy of the English throne to his (supposed) subjects and to history. And… and… no stutter. Not once!

He didn’t just speak, he spoke so eloquently many people, even those who hated him, were impressed. Fuck… I’m happy for him. I can say beyond a reasonable doubt it felt like God killed the gremlin. What vindication! Indeed, Charles’s last words were a clearly spoken:

> Truly I desire their (the people’s) liberty and freedom as much as anybody whomsoever; but I must tell you their liberty and freedom consist in having of government, those laws by which their life and their goods may be most their own. It is not for having a share in government, Sir, that is nothing pertaining to them. A subject and a ruler are clear different things...therefore I tell you that I am the Martyr of the people. I die a Christian according to the profession of the Church of England, as I found it left me by my father... I have a good Cause and I have a gracious God. I will say no more.

Clearly spoken words about being totally behind the times. I'm still happy for his moment, but he gave England 16 of civil war because he thought he was a living god. The truth was, kings were no longer needed. The people could rule themselves. Charles should have been happy his children grew up. He could have helped them grow up by conceding powers to Parliament and avoiding 16 years of war. But he never comprehended that. He never tried to step beyond his comfort zone and expand his mindset or evolve. Instead he lived in splendor, hide behind spectacle, and used the people’s money to hire foreigners to kill them.

Later kings still didn’t learn. Even more distanced from the frontline inside their palaces, banquets and balls, their heads filled with different gremlins that said the rules are just, good, and will never end. France, Spain, Russia had country wide bankruptcies, food shortages, and revolutions, and it didn’t matter. The ultimate gremlin  is isolation from the frontline. Many more Darth Kings faced the chopping block with the voice of God calling them martyrs.

So the question now is... why did you think Darth Blockbuster would ever admit he was wrong and change his ways?

## The Majic of the Internet - Because of Cyborgolgy, If We Use the Internet, We Automatically Fight For the Digital Age

The internet has many protagonists. Paul Baran is one of the big ones. Here’s why.

The internet is a network. There are many ways of sending data through a network. The simplest is how phone systems do it with a direct circuit link between two phones. A call’s connection only stops when someone hangs up.

Alexander Graham Bell invented "direct circuit links" in 1876 and put it into action when he co-founded the American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T) in 1885. For generations direct links was how all telecommunications worked. But when the Soviets tested a hydrogen bomb in 1955, Paul Baran took it upon himself to make a new tool to help prevent a nuclear holocaust.

Baran realized to prevent nuclear war, the world needed a communications network that would survive an atomic attack. Only robust and reliable communications would ease American and Soviet trigger fingers during tense times.

Baran worked alone after work. By 1960 he came up with the two ideas he needed. The first was that his network should have no hubs or organizations (like telephone’s have) to control the flow of information. Central hubs make systems vulnerable to attack or failure. Instead data flow should be completely distributed so every node can send and receive information equally. Baran’s nodes network looks like a fishnet. When each  node has three or four links, the network can survive any attack.

Next Baran had to figure out how to send information across the network. This led to his second idea, which was to break up the data into standard-size little packets. Each message would be broken into many packets, each of which would scurry along different paths through the network’s nodes and be reassembled when they got to their destination. If one packet didn’t get there in time, it was quickly resent. This way there’d be no "dropped calls" and communication would always stay open. Baran published his ideas into very detailed technical specs and made sure everyone, especially the Soviets, could copy his work.

Baran then walked into a nest of villains in America. When Baran’s employer RAND recommended his "node-packet data network" idea to the Air Force (in control of America’s nuclear missiles) they wanted to build it. But when the Department of Defense got itself and the Defense Communications Agency involved Baran soon found out working with so many bureaucrats was hopeless.

So Baran tried to convince AT&T, in control of America’s telephone network, to supplement their system with his node-packet data network. "They fought it tooth and nail," he recalled. "They tried all sorts of things to stop it". They would not even let RAND use the maps of its circuits, so Baran had to use a pirated set. He made several trips to AT&T headquarters in lower Manhattan. On one of them, a senior executive who was an old engineer looked stunned when Baran explained that his system would mean that data could go back and forth without a dedicated link remaining open. "He looked at his colleagues in the room while his eyeballs rolled up sending a signal of his utter disbelief," according to Baran. After a pause, the executive said, "Son, here’s how a telephone works," and explained a patronizing and simplistic description.

The metaphorical Death Star rule book became real! It was against the rules to make a reliable communication network that might help prevent a nuclear holocaust. Good thing Jedi’s don’t give up. Baran continued to push. AT&T finally had him and other outsiders to a series of seminars explaining how its telephone system really worked. "It took ninety-four separate speakers to describe the entire system," Baran marveled. When it was over, the AT&T executives asked Baran, "Now do you see why packet switching wouldn’t work?" To their great disappointment, Baran simply replied, "No".

To heck with Darth Telephone!

A decade later Baran’s network was built when the US government’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) saw the wisdom in a node-packet distributed communications network. In 1969 ARPA used Baran’s technical specs to build ARPAnet, the first version of the internet. The people who made it were hellbent on empowering individuals, and the made sure the internet could not be controlled by any government or corporation.

Baran’s network is why our smartphones, websites, Wikipedia, any digital tool connected to the internet empower individuals. In the DNA of the internet is a distributed node network that nobody can control or shutdown. An individual has the exact same access as any corporation or government.

That’s why the internet is majical. Whoever uses it, is automatically empowered.

_Paul Baran's story was adapted from Walter Isaacson's awesome book_ The Innovators, _Chapter 7._

## Climax - Polar Bears in the Amazon, Collaboration is the future, as is ecosystems

If someone were to tell you how to vote, while looking over your shoulder, you'd be weirded out and call the police. And society in general would agree nobody should tell you, nor force you, how to vote. You yourself haven't done anything to earn that right. It's a byproduct of living inside a political ecosystem with guns used by recognized policeman, fair judges of a court system, and the absence of invasions or desperation that lets every member of the community cast a vote.

Your life wont get better until you think of a tools in the same way. The solution to your political and economic problems. Using red/blue philosophies is a recipe for living in the past.

Everytime you listen to a political speech just notice how many times they talk. Once you ask yourself what tool am I getting to bring down taxes, cap the debt ceiling, fight climate change, then you'll talking solutions. Until then you'll be experincing societal collapse.

## Did it work? Did you see the Matrix, which is asking did you see yourself playing the game more after reading this all?

## A Fond Farewell - Listing all the metaphors and saying goodbye

I tried to make the history lesson as readable as possible. Almost all the topics and subjects are metaphors for the lessons Europe learned from going to the divine rights of kings, to the rousseau philosophy of political democracy and equality we live in today. Here they are:

The frontline is Nicolo Machiavelli's "effectual truth". Machiavelli came from a poor family, whose father gave him many books from the recent printing press. Machiavelli was the first philosoper to get to read lots of different philosophy and history books, and he noticed trends. He told superstitious Europeans, they didn't need to put their faith in God, because we can keep looking for trends, master them, and start to overcome problems like hunger, disease, and all that.

Soon later Galileo, Francis Bacon, and lots of other people, read this insight, and invented the Scientific Method, which systemized looking for "effectual truth" by simply testing Nature with instruments, and discovering the truth, not inventing it with reason. Hence it's the "point of contact" between a tool and it's use is an experiment. Thus the truth of the experiment is our guide, not the rules of the social heirarchy.

Natural equality, the extras waiting to become protagonists, is from Thomas Hobbes. He lived during the English Civil War, when people were again sick of the king but didn't have different ruling philosophy to replace him with. Hobbes invented human equality by saying in Nature (he called it the State of Nature), all lifeforms live freely, thus why shouldn't humans. Hobbes said people should still be loyal to a king, yet not because he's divine, but because it's in the best interest to have a stable and firm government because when that goes away--as Hobbes was personally seeing--people turn horrible. Because the king wasn't divine, his power to rule came from the consent of the goverened, who are like him, equals.

Something ... comes from John Locke. He came after Hobbes and agreed with his State of Nature, but said the people didn't need to put all their trust into a person as leader, but instead put their trust in the institution as leader. Meaning, the people should follow a president, not a king. That way the people can elect, new leaders while still getting the stability of government. Hence, the leader can always be a protagonist, and anyone who fights the will of the people, the people on the frontline, is an antagonist.

Ruling philosophy, old philosopheis, comes from Rousseau. Rousseau merged all the thinking from Machiavelli to Locke, and said the people can't rule within the confines of an old philosophy. Thus, even though philosophers from Machiavelli to Locke were giving new philosophy, they didn't say to breakfree from the past. Rousseau say change it all, which is why the people used him during their revolutions, and why I talked about him above. We also need to change it all.

The Sith and Jedi, protagonist and antagonist, is Hegel's Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis dialectics. After centuries of histories, looked back at the trends, and said there was a ruling philosophy, whose problems manifested into a competitor, the two would eventually fight it out, and make a new ruling philosphy that merged the two together. He also said master–slave is a relationship that recurs throughout humanity, and is the reason we looked at Frederick Douglas and Neo, who while was the physical slave, his captors were the mental ones, bound to a horrible social system as much as Frederick was. Frederick's process of self-discovery, was how slaves realize their status and break free.

Cyborgology, and majic, are Darwinism. The evolution of lifeforms based on their tools to collect resources. Life started out as simple organisms, and as these primitive lifeforms struggled to survive, they adapted better --biological--tools to do so. Eventually the benefits of biology maxed out with us, and so we have to continue evolution with tools. We similarly started to evolve (techvolve) with primitive tools, which slowly got better and better.

Death star, Darth Blockbuster, and dark majic come from modern psychology. And this is the real reason I wrote this book.

All of this is hard to understand. It seems simple because it's your life, and you think your opinions matter. But there's a reason we go to the doctor when we're feeling sick. They know the human antonmy, and we don't, even though we own one.

So the question is, if these are the characters inside the repeating story of civlization, which one do you think you are?

# EPILOGUE

## Stargazer Let's Look Through the Life Star

Stargazer, once upon a time everyone was an astronomer. Anyone could look up at the sky, see the amazing show up there, and make up whatever they wanted. Some answers make more sense, but explaining what was up there, from angels to fireflies, is impossible to see, so impossible to disprove.

What digital tools will do, is tell us who we are. It will track our individual decisions, and reveal us to ourselves. And are people going to want to learn the lesson, and step out of their own matrix, or are they going to justify their belief system the way so many justified the Earth being the centre of the Universe.

And that's the climax. A question as big as any ever asked. What's going to happen when we start to realize how much Death Stars and dark majic our political decisions are made under. Religions, philosophies, corporate manuals, and so forth making people press the button because they can't say no.

Let's take a look.

## My App - showcase the lessons along the way

I never wanted to write this book. I wrote a similar book years ago "A Non Functioning Society: Why the 2008 Economic Crisis Was Only the Beginning". All the lessons from here are there. For example, it predicts the western world is trying to assert a economic ecosystem, and thus needs borders. Trump and Brexit were as predictable as the orbit of Mars once Newton wrote gravity's equations.

I wanted to showcase how we can make smooth out our economic problems making solving real world problems with digital tools. Which be definition means people solving their own problems "Think Global Act Local". "Techvolution" would be a way to make digital products. That didn't work out.

My app. Using modern web development, it took just a few months of work. Take some free code from GitHub, an inexpensive cloud computing account, and the design skills of a novice. It was simple. Might not even get me a job in "tech".

The tool wasn’t polished because new tools never are. But it was, and would have been, so effective because it came directly from the frontline. A place far away from today’s ruling philosophy.

Here’s how it worked. Today’s car insurance claim system depends on drivers exchanging information like names or insurance policy numbers after a car accident. Drivers are frazzled so they usually don’t. My adjusting job was talking to these drivers to process their insurance claims. The one supposed to return drivers back to normal; at least as best to normal as money can get them. A big problem was simply knowing who the other driver and adjuster were. Since we often didn’t know, we had to search for it; literally calling around or hoping someone calls you. Delays piled up like crazy.

Adjusting sucks. Our only tools were a telephone, email, voicemail, checkbook, google, and a supervisor telling us to hurry up or get fired. Beyond st-st-stress stressful, very emotionally taxing.

Until you speak with a driver who is a real person.

Real person because their accident wasn’t an inconvenience but a life changing horror. Maybe their arm was amputated, or their friend was ejected from the car, or their kid burned alive twelve hours ago.

You’re mind shuts up Darth Call Centre the moment you talk to this real person. They have a problem and your soul wants to help.

Why did this happen? That’s all drivers want to know. Was someone trying to beat a red light? Was the road not salted for ice. Was it drunk driving? What’s the reason for the sudden terror of pain? It’s soothes people to know why the accident happened; it really helps knowing it won’t happen again.

My app combined several existing technologies, email, internet, GPS, google maps, and web apps, to make a new tool. It let insurance adjusters post an accident on a google map, and verified their identity by their work email. Since every accident shares the GPS coordinates, all adjusters, regardless what drivers do, can find each other. It’s minimal operating cost was paid for by rental car companies and repair shops, who loved the ability to email invoices directly to adjusters without having to call first.

A simple new tool that only someone on the frontline would ever feel the pain to make.

Society would have saved hundreds of millions in insurance claim operating costs. That’s cool. Adjuster’s and drivers would save hours of their day. That’s cool too. But this is the part worth fighting over. With my app, for the first time, we’d have a database of the exact location and causes of car accidents. Thereafter we could cross reference with weather, traffic, demographics, and many other databases. We’d finally learn why car accidents happen, and start to fight back.

This database doesn’t exist today. So, when tree branches grow over stop signs, tires are faulty, intersections jam up too much, pot holes get too big, or anything else repeatedly causes accidents, we don’t even know. With machine learning and artificial intelligence, we’d find trends to the millions of accidents, and tens of thousands of deaths that happen every year.

In a world held a bit steadier and comforted just a little more by such an app, who would be the loser?

People who don’t feel frontline pain. In my case executives, lawyers, marketers, and consultants. Like Darth Blockbuster, they didn’t know one thing about their own industry. Not one. It existed only to stand above in an art film of self-entitlement. Their self-entitlement, blank faces, clueless looks, arrogant smirks angered me so much it merged years of political theory in my mind, and let me see a new ruling philosophy called Techvolution in my head.

It was still hard writing this book. It involved condensing so much political and economic theory and history (there’s a lot) into such a short space. I was mentally pretty tired, and despite indulging in Jack Jones’ "The Impossible Dream" too much, a little bitter. Then I watched an episode of Netflix’s _Black Mirror_ and went back to work.

This episode was the tale of a crazed man, who wants to talk with the powerful CEO of an Instagram-like app called Smithereens. He holds a company intern hostage, awaiting the CEO’s call. Police surround him, corporate lackies try to deflect him, bullets are fired at him, but he still wants his phone call. Nobody knows why.

I started to cry. I soon wept. I understood this man and I knew why he went crazy.

I knew distracted driving had killed someone close to him. The man had been driving, and he checked his Smithereen feed, saw a picture of a dog or something, and he missed a drunk running a stop sign, and his beloved fiancée died.

I didn’t know it was his own distracted driving, but I knew the pain the actor played out so well. I knew that because I heard it through the same crazy cries from mothers and daughters, husbands and sons. Each just wanted to tell someone why it happened, so maybe it wouldn’t happen again.

I made a new tool that would have helped. Not solved. Not actual magic, but it majically would have gotten us closer. It was against the rules because solving problems is a good story the makes people realize art and spectacle is what Darth Blockbuster lives on is bullshit.

He’ll never say that, or even know it. He thinks frontline pain is a thing to stand above, not ever feel and solve with new tools. Darth is nothing if not detached. He is the epitome of apathy in the face of others’ pain. That’s his worst and most irredeemable quality.

I did my best as a protagonist. I was not good enough to prevent anyone’s Smithereens, but I did my best. The point isn’t that I wallowed in self-pity or guilt. The point is that neither self-pity nor guilt need to exist in the digital age. We can do better! The philosophy of digital tools isn’t a place of sword wielding heroes with a mass of peasants behind them. I pushed as far and high as I could.

Am I done fighting? No. I’ve picked up another tool, though, one that fits better in my hand and that may allow me to still reach out to many others who feel the need to evolve: a book. But I am just a speck in the sea that’s got to rise up and rinse the world of old sins and false beliefs. Other protagonists can pick up where I left off—they can go further than I could even dream of. That’s how society truly evolves: a pyramid of helping hands, not a pyramid of chopped limbs and ripped-up ideas. Everyone  is either an extra choosing the best tools, or a hero working to earn their  favor, in the ruling philosophy of Techvolution.

Who are you, Stargazer? Who will you be?

Every person I spoke to was being rational. They were simply following orders. I was the outsider trying to tell them they don't need to. But were perfectly happy to keep doing so, and felt justified. In an industry so dependant on old tools, following orders was the means to success. Free thinkers were dangerous. New tools were a mortal threat.

I never wanted to write this book. There's no way to make people realize which character they are. Protagonist, extras, antagonist, Darth Blockbuster, all that is hidden by dark majic and social rules.

It doesn't tell us the philosphy that need, it's telling us the philosphy digital tools will show us. Just like scientific instruments revealed the Natural world to us, digital tools will reveal us to ourselves. We'll be challenged us to act based on our contributions to a higher purpose, instead of our psychological bent. Like scientists today use instruments to uncover the rulebook, digital tools will help us uncover who we are, and what our politics and economic tools and leaders should be. A rule-book already in use by open-source because it fosters evolution, not kill it like its opposite. I called it the Life Star.
