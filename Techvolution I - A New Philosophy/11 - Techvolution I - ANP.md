"_People are angry, man! Most people's lives suck...Even if like the economy is doing better, the vast majority of people aren't doing what they want to do with their lives._" Joe Rogan, November 2019.

This book was going to deal with your levels of anger and happiness in life. It was going to begin with analyzing your take on the economy, nation, and life at large.

Now we’ve hit the Great 2020 Pandemic. I don’t need to inquire about your happiness anymore. If you’re like most Americans and Canadians, you’re likely downright terrified.

For years, North Americans suffered under bad trends: micro-management at work, antisocial behavior at home, and political hatred in government. We got by because superficially we’re “doing great”: we have full employment, luxurious homes, and stable politics. Whenever things got too bad, and we got too unhappy, we visted the shopping mall for therapy. If we were still angry, we’d install a new political party. Over the years, we’ve given Left and Right the levers of power many times.

No matter which we choose, Main Street remains unhappy.

There is something fundamentally wrong with our society. Now, as our ancestors did so many times before, we have to step up and rethink our way of life. The hardest part isn’t about explaining our problems or coming up with solutions. It involves the realization that we should be happy with our jobs, government, and life.

It’s our right to enjoy happy lives.

Individual happiness is the ultimate sign of a healthy society. Interesting to note, our ancestors were often happier then we are; even though they were poor in comparison. Our grand-parents or great-grandparents weren't "simpler". Nor did they have lower standards. They were happier because they saw their society improve each year. Since life was getting better, their hard work was easier to bear.

Our society isn't reaching its potential. The trends that makes us unhappy like horrible commutes, mindless bureaucracies, and expensive education keep getting worse. The first reason is because as employees and customers of big bureacracies or corporations were powerless to demand better. But the primary reason for our stagnation is thinking we're "fighting back" by picking a Left or Right political party.

Nothing changes with either because the truth is we give Conservative and Progressive ideologies far too much credit. Following one (or hating another) is never going to solve our problems.

When I began writing this book in September 2019, I wanted to (somehow) convince regular people to stop putting so much faith in Left and Right writers, commentators, and parties. Both ideologies were invented centuries ago; before humanity even had electricity. These doctrines and ideas are simply too old and outdated to give us happiness in a modern, healthy society.

It's okay to change our ideologies. There's nothing special about any of them. That's something most people don't realize. We are free to pick and choose between democratic socialism, conservative monarchy, or Left and Right because every ideology was created to help society prosper. If you're not happy, you can change your political ideology.

And now you should. Because today this novel virus is highlighting our society’s shaky foundations better than any writer could.

There have been thousands of pandemics throughout history—and yet today we were caught with our pants down. I know our politics has been busy and getting constant public attention, after all the president was impeached! What was the reason again? Even if you agreed with it then, was that really what the government should have been obessed with only a few months ago?

Both “sides” are the faces of the exact same coin. When President Obama tried to overhaul the healthcare system, was any commentator, strategists, or politicians talking about pandemic plans? We have fire drills throughout our society; why don’t we have pandemic plans?

Here’s why. Instead of governing our society, Left and Right ideologues, commentators, and politicians have been playing chicken with each other.

Our political ideologies are outdated. Our society is so philosophically old, we're now literally sick from it. That means our civilization’s ability to deal with life’s inevitable pitfalls (e.g., depressions, wars, and pandemics) will only worsen. I happened to be writing this book long before the new corona virus. Suddenly history has given us all a sad reality check.

To fix our civilization and re-attain health and happiness, we need to revamp a lot of things. Techvolution, a new philosophy that empowers the people of Main Street, can help us get there.

## Our Levers of Power

Do me a favor. Open up Skype or FaceTime. Now check your Instagram feed. Then get Google Maps up and running.

I'm serious, open these apps up please. Come back when you're done.

Within a few seconds you can chat with friends, get live TV, and be told excellent directions. Isn't it cool that wherever you go, you'll have these very important levers of power at your disposal. I mean, can you imagine writing down driving directions on a napkin? What about driving back and forth to Blockbuster everytime you want to watch a movie?

Of course not. This isn't 1990.

Now get your medical records ready. Okay good. Next up, collect all your recent health metrics like weight, heart rate, temperature, and sleep cycles from your FitBit or Apple Watch. Excellent, now let's evaluate your risk factor to Covid-19 by comparing your statistics to the records of those unlucky people who got sick; especially the ones who got really sick.

What characteristics is this new disease targetting? Blood types, genetics, diet, lifestyles?

ROGAN

I hope your risk factor is good. But, if you're in trouble, what does your nurse or doctor say to do? Don't tell me, but I hope it was at least calming to hear specialized medical advice.

Hey, don't forget, there's a possible drug shortage. So, what does your pharmacist recommened? Do you have enough prescriptions in case things get terrible? What should you start doing now to plan for the worse?

After you've collaborated with these health professionals, quickly find out what your health insurance company will pay for. Just in case, it's good to know before disaster strikes.

Phew, that was educational. Isn't it good to know all this stuff! Apps and gadgets are cool, but I personally think knowledge is the greatest lever of power.

## Problems

Wait, wait, wait. FaceTime worked, so did Instagram, and Google Maps. But is the medical records "lever" stuck? What will the ER doctor assess you by in case of a flood of patients? Did I hear that right, you aren't in contact with your doctor? What about your pharmacist? You're waiting on hold with your insurance company! Insurance is basically a bank-account for disasters, and you now during a pandemic you have no idea how much money you have?

This all sounds like I'm talking to someone living through the 1918 Spanish Flu Pandemic. It's like science-fiction in reverse. Because, if someone in 1918 was teleported to 2020, they'd fit in just fine.

Well, at least many of our students, teachers, and workers can work, learn, and collaborate from home in these tough times.

WHAT! You’re still driving to work! Or worse, your work or school is closed!

What the fuck is wrong with your laptop and the internet at home? Wasn't there a plan to keep things moving in case of earthquakes (San Francisco 1989), riots (Vancouver 2011), hurricanes (New Orleans 2005), great fires (Fort McMurray 2016), floods (New Jersey 2012), and blizzards (every winter in North America)?

Of course we didn't have a plan for Covid-19; because we don't have a plan for any disaster. And that's because our way of life is being controlled by a select amount of people looking to protect their high-paying jobs.

I was insurance company claims adjuster for eight years. The person with the checkbook you talk to after car accidents or house fires. And even in an industry that supposed to plan for the worst and promote a low-risk lifestyle, all of us adjusters had to drive into an office during heat-waves, blizzards, and ice-storms.

It's quite surreal to speak with people who had a horrible car crash on the same roads your boss is demanding you drive. You can have a debate about telecommuting versus offices—but not when there's three feet of snow on the streets.

This speaks to our society's fundamental problem. Regular people aren't ready for bad times because we aren't free to decide what's best for ourselves in the good times.

It's our own fault. We're so powerless against the coronavirus pandemic, because we've given the levers of power in our schools, companies, bureaucracies, and hospitals to the same people making us unhappy with our lives.

## Unhappy is a Sign of an Unhealthy Society

Our workplaces are riddled with too many bureaucrats and managers. This way of life made us very unhappy. I wrote a book to try to convince you, it also made us dangerously complacent too. And now, sadly, it's obvious for everyone to see and feel with every moment we hear "it's getting closer".

Our society is fragile, because our "eight different bosses" micro-management culture has been running our hospitals, insurance companies, banks, and so many other industries, for generations. They have no incentive to change if they're living large on your dollar.

As a result, when do use our education system, make a claim, try to understand our mortgage, it's like we're still renting DVDs from Blockbuster. As in, we're stuck with the hours of operation, DVD selection, and corporate policies of the rich and powerful with no ability to have our say.

Having our say makes all the difference in the world. It's difference between being lost at sea with a radio hearing other people decide where to search for you, and having a two-way radio telling them where you are and what you need.

But, why would the eight different bosses give you the power to have your say? After all, the one with the money has the control, and the one who needs it, is under control.

So, now, regular people have super-advanced apps like Skype, Instagram, and Google Maps in their private lives. But, we're all watching CNN, reading random bullshit, and wondering how we'll earn a livng, while a novel disease is searching the globe for human hosts.

That's so stupid. We've had Internet Age technologies for years. We could have been evolving a more prepared and antifragile way of life. If we didn't let self-interested bosses control our society.

Internet Age technology can empower us against with crisis far better. For example, watch _The Pharmicist_ on Netflix, and you'll see how a simple online database of prescriptions stopped oxycontin pill mills. Too bad it took bureaucrats and politicians many years to make. If done sooner we would have found out which pushy drug salesman and corrupt doctors were responsible for the oxycontin epidemic.

OXY EPIDEMIC

In fact, with open-source software (the free technology that makes programs like Instagram possible), the public could have banded together and made a simple and secure prescription database. This prescription app would cost just a few million to make and operate.

This price tag is free consiering it would have prevented 500,000 doctor prescribed heroin overdoses.

But, the people on Main Street didn’t use internet technologies to upgrade our civilization. Instead, we listened to “eight different” bosses drone on about memos and mission statements.

When nagging about TPS reports made us unhappy with our everyday lives we bought bigger TVs, cars, and houses. Many the middle-class got too angry we'd turn to Left and Right politics. We thought marching in a Tea Party parade, or watching a Bernie Sanders political speech, was doing our part to make society better.

It wasn't.

That's why year after year, the combination of self-interested bureaucrats and Left/Right politcs kept making us unhappier. And now we're paying for it, as we depend on our weakened health-care system to stop this pandemic.

PICTURE
_Over-buying stuff is what average people are told and expected to do. This might as well be Black Friday or Holiday shopping. Today, regular people should be collaborating with health professionals, their co-workers, their family to find out how we can best deal with this storm. We could if we believed in a new philosophy that freed us from heavy bureaucracy, and made us realize our salvation is reaching for new technologies._

## Our Old Health Care System

In this TED talk, Dr. Alieta Eck talks about working in our medical system. She discusses how much of a let-down being a doctor is today. You see, when she started medical school in the early ’80s, she thought being a doctor meant making deep connections with her patients. She pictured detailed examinations, home visits, and being there when needed most.

Dr. Eck got something far different. To her sadness, the Main Street economy where customers directly dealt with specialists like carpenters, tailors, and doctors, was long gone.

True to the trend ravaging our economy, what Dr. Eck got was ever more micro-managing bureaucrats. The valued administration of clincs and hopsitals was taken over by bureaucracies. Since 1970, these bureaucrats have created ever more paperwork, guidelines, and manuals to put themselves in between doctors and their patients. That's why our society doesn't have "Medical FaceTime" or “InstaHealth” apps connecting patients directly with their therapists, doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and nutritionists.

These apps would put many micro-managing middlemen out of a job.

![Health Admins](/img\diagrams\healthcare-administrators.png)
_"Hello, Peter," memos, and eight different bosses multiplied by 3500%, and trending up no matter which political party we elected into power._

The above is the almost countless government regulators, project managers, hospital administrators, claims adjusters, corporate executives, insurance underwriters, lawyers, and more memos then anyone can imagine. Many of these people are needed. Many are not. All of them have been sucking our health-care system dry for generations while holding back new technologies.

We didn’t notice. Too many of us thought being a consumer meant it was okay to assume "they" in the medical system would work for our best interest. Or, we’ve been obsessed with Left/Right politics and thought "fighting for our health-care" meant picking a side for (or against) government or corporate health insurance.

In the end, being a consumer means having to follow the giant rules and regulations of big organizations. And, the Left's ideology of Big Government and the right's ideology of Big Business came together to make a philosophy of of "Big Problems" for Main Street. A 3500% increase in government and corporate middle-men means all our hospital cleaners, nurses, and doctors were being understaffed and underpowered for generations.

> A lab inspector from the state came, and wanted to know who was running this (lab) machine. And she wanted to be sure they all have high-school diplomas. Well, we had RN degrees, MD degrees. That didn't suffice. She wanted to see high-school diplomas. That's an example of mindless bureaucray. Dr. Alieta Eck. https://youtu.be/mafghkNmKgo?t=54

Talk to anyone on the frontline of today’s pandemic and ask them if they feel ready. Surgical masks are running low. Cleaners don't have enough disinfectant chemicals. Our medical system isn't a military operations with calling our the "pandmic plan B" from the playbook. Even with so many bureaucrats, no one was planning for a disaster. It sounds like the mayhem in car and property insurance after storms would hit, so I can sympathize with these brave people.

So, despite loyally donating our time and money to the Left or Right in the health-care debate, and spending billions on our system, when our society is being put to the test, we’re all watching CNN or Fox News, buying toilet paper, and hoping for the best. That’s the actions of extras watching the story of their lives instead of being active players in it.

It’s sad if you think about it.

I mean, a person during the Spanish Flu Pandemic of 1918 got their news on radios and newspapers. What would they say about us doing the same while holding supercomputers, HD cameras, and biometric sensors in our hands?

If you believe in Leftist politics, explain how more regulations, or single-payer health insurance will help us prepare for the next pandemic. Insurance is important, but have a vote on the issue and move on to improving other areas of our health-care system such as comparative analysis of treatments, or making every insurance easier to use.

If you're a Rightist, ask how many corporate boardrooms want their employees to be financially independent and capable of taking months off work when needed? Practically none is the answer. Then how is more corporate employment the best way to make regular people more secure in the future.

Moreover, the Left's love of a government social safety net, and the Right's dedication to "the markets" as everyone's path to prosperity, is proving itself to be lacking. Assuming it comes at all, government help is weeks away, and hardly a guarantee regular people can depend on. And the stock markets recent plunge wiped out so many personal savings' even though we personally did nothing wrong. Why should regular people depend on undependenablee support systems?

The truth is at this moment, people need solar panels, stores of food in their cellars, a reliable and local supply system, self-serve education systems, seamless communication with medical professionals, easy tests for the corona virus, and the ability to still make a living even if disaster strikes.

Regular people can have all of this with modern technology. That's the hidden secret of today's society. With todays electronics and software we don't need to depend on Big Government or Big Business.

If someone from 1918 were to see us today, the'd marvel at the internet, FaceTime, and Youtube, before commenting that we have the tools of science fiction, just not the way of life yet.

Techvolution will give it to us.

## Segway

Crisis should teach us to evolve. But, every crisis in recent memory, from the [Savings and Loan Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_and_loan_crisis), [Dot Com Crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble), and the [Great Recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession) our politcians borrowed more money, and bailed out more "too big to fail" business to prevent having to admit something was wrong with our society.

But this pandemic is something else. Printing more money can't kill a virus. Regular people literally can't go shopping to distract themselves from the bad news. After so many crisis were ignored, this one is actually shutting our society down. And, despite doing our jobs and paying our taxes, regular people have no idea what's going to happen next. Our retirement savings, medical plans, food supply, even our livelihoods are levers of power we don't control.

The corona virus shows us how weak Main Street is. We were, and are still, justified to be unhappy with our society. The pain of this crisis tells us how we must evolve.

If you want to assume things will go back to normal soon, then please return to watching television broadcasts. I'm sure Conservative and Progressive commentators and politicians blaming each other for your problems will entertain you for years to come.

Covid-19 is a wake-up call to those who want to hear it. The truth is, it's not good enough anymore for regular people to do their job, go shopping, vote every four years, and assume big government and big business will educate our kids, make a healthy medical system, and provide reliable livelihood.

Happiness is our right, but it's our duty to pursure it and make it happen.

It all comes down to this one historical fact. The Industrial Age ended in 1969. The Internet Age started in 1970. Since this handoff, the middle-class has gotten better and better technology at our fingertips in our private lives. But we haven't done the hard work and update our economics and politics to the modern age.

As a result, our health-care system, work cultures, and in general, our way of life was held back by the bureaucratic establishment of the Industrial Age.

We could be doing so much better. With digital technology we can unpower the middlemen and empower Main Street. Doctors, adjusters, mechanics, therapists, tailors, educators, everyone with a frontline skill can hold their levers of power once again. That's the only way we can pay down our debts, eliminate nasty commutes, liberate us from micro-management, and deal with horrible pandemics with knowledge and skill instead of fear and loathing.

To get to this new world, Main Street needs a new philosophy.

Here it is. Its big lesson is this. The middle-class must grab hold of apps, computers, and the internet to solve our problems now. If we don't, we'll soon be suffering something much worse than unhappiness and scary pandemics. There's only so much longer we can keep running our civilization on the fumes of Left/Right ideology.

## Dedication

_This book is for the people in the open-source community. For the collaboration philosophy you handed down to me. For selflessly updating Wikipedia, writing free software, and building cool new tech for us all. For being the protagonists of the Internet Age. You gave the best education a political guy can get. I hope I've learned enough to write this book for you._

_For the antagonists, the self-entitled delegators keeping Blockbuster—and it's Industrial Age mentality—alive, thanks for making history to repeat itself yet again. I hope you learn something._

_This book is especially dedicated to the extras on Main Street. When it's time for you to act, I pray you decide to play the game._

## Quote

"_We are really the revolutionaries in the world today—not the kids with long hair and beards who were wrecking the schools a few years ago._"

Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, 1973.

## Note to the reader

I used many images and videos throughout the book. My reasons are twofold: visuals help explain ideas, and they exemplify the life-changing flexibility and immediacy that the Internet has given to our way of life. Today, millions of regular people are communicating views, opinions, and information with no middlemen in government or business to control their messages. Not since the printing-press has information empowered ordinary people so much. These content creators and their audiences are doing historic work is. And of course, all credit for the media goes to them.

Also, I use pop culture references such as those of Star Wars, Star Trek, Harry Potter, and computer games (e.g. Civilization). If you're not a fan, don't worry too much. If we were in Ancient Greece, I'd use Greek Mythology. If we were in Victorian Britain, I'd use Shakespeare. Using familiar stories is a more natural way to explain philosophy, politics, and in general, to relate to one another. Of course, all due credit goes to the media's owners.

Also I'm still getting feedback on this book, so if you notice anything amiss, please let me know.

# Introduction

## Politics

Donald Trump is the savior of Western Civilization. If that turns your emotions on, with tears or cheers, then you are missing the point of politics. Politics isn't about voting for a political party, advocating for a political cause, and it's definitely not screaming at a TV. The government is so big—with so many politicians, civil servants, companies, and interest groups fighting for control, it will never respond to your small voice.

Tears or cheers don't make a person powerful.

On the contrary, you see, exercising, composting, teaching your kids to prepare for the worst _does_ change the world. Good decisions change and improve your world—giving you freedom from dependency and power over your part of society. And, since power is to politics what money is to finance, your personal choices are always your most potent political weapon.

The question is, how do we increase your powers. The answer, we'll find out in this book, is better technology, and the self-awareness to use it to improve your life. But this isn't a self-help book about making you "happy." It's about making you powerful so you can earn your happiness.

Our way of life is trying to evolve into the Internet Age. But, the established powers of the Industrial Age have been holding us back. Our society's ability to deal with life's inevitable pitfalls (like pandemics) will only get worse until we completely change what you think is politics.

Thus, this current state of affairs, gives the middle class a unique opportunity to learn a big lesson.

Only if we grab hold of modern tools and join the fight to upgrade our society, can we live safer, more predictacle, and happy lives again. It's a good opportunity, one we should all jump at.

## New Tech, New Age, New Philosophy

Life improves with better technology. Deaths from disease, famine, and war all decrease as our technological power has gone up. Look at this corona pandemic and see how lucky we are.

I'm serious. Before 1880, doctors didn't even wash their hands before surgeries. Nobody even knew bacteria and virus even existed. Most people thought disease was caused by "stale air" and would open windows in hospitals. And now 2020 we're already working on a Covid-19 vaccine.

We still have many problems today, but our technology in medicine, agriculture, education has given us lives our ancestors would envy.

Now we have computers and the internet. They are game-changers. Laptops, digital cameras, tablets, drones, digital sensors are all millions of times better than just 30 years ago. Modern technology dramatically empowers us to keep fighting off pandemics, hunger, ignorance, and war. But, only if we use them to keep inventing and staying ahead of our problems.

In Nature, lifeforms evolve in jumps called eras or epochs. Likewise, humanity develops new technology in leaps; what we call "ages." When a new age comes, its technology is so unique and powerful, it changes how society functions. Things were very different in the Stone Age in comparison to the Bronze Age, for example.

Today we're going from the Industrial Age (1760-1969) to the Internet Age (1970-). It can be hard to appreciate all the changes. There's a lot to think about when civilization's entire way of life upgrades to new technology. I've been thinking about our evolution for years and only now have a grasp.

Improving our technology is hard work, but at least we understand how to do research and development. Upgrading politics isn't so straightforward. Evolving new politics and philosophy happens with strong emotions, civil wars, and revolutions.

I want to help you understand your importance in it all.

Because in 1970, personal computers and the internet came online. Since then, computer geeks, hackers, and innovators have been upgrading our society to the Internet Age. All the while, the "eight differnt bosses" inside Industrial Age companies and government bureaucracies have been holding us back to keep their obsolete products and services alive.

Being forced to use outdated technology is why middle-class life is can be so unhappy. It's why we drive in endless traffic, still us so much oil for our energy, can't understand the tax code, and worry about our kids' futures. Middle-class life will only get better once we finish the Internet Age upgrade.

There's no shortcuts, cheats, or gimmicks. There's just you and your friends on Main Street who must do the work.

The first step is a new mindset. Because we the people already have the amazingly powerful digital tools we need. We only need to believe in modern philosophy to upgrade to the Internet Age.

## Looking Up

There's a lot to realize when thinking about human evolution. I found it very helpful to "look up" and imagine what our community looks like from above. Looking up lets you "look down" and gain a proper perspective on our society.

I didn't just imagine this better perspective; I got to see it. Play computer games like _Age of Empires, Anno 1800_, and _Civilization_, and you'll get to as well.

You'll be the "player god" of a civilization. A virtual divinity who knows all and sees all, and who puts its general will into action using an array of buttons, switches, and toggles. As you play the game, you'll use these levers of power to decide what to research, where to place buildings, and when to click "upgrade".

Pressing that most important button magically transforms every factory, hospital, road, house, citizen, to the technology of the modern era. Below, you'll see a person being the player god in the game _Anno 1800_.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/GrandioseTinyApisdorsatalaboriosa' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

The above is a computer game, of course, but it represents reality pretty well. We're all in there somewhere right now, trying to figure out how to earn a living while the game plays around us.

That's why this book's cover page is a regular person standing on Main Street—a single guy or girl in civilization. His or her job is to do what's best for themself and help society prosper. Gazing up for guidance, you see heroes and villains. In the sky high above is the mythical "player god," whose ultimately the one making the decisions.

Will the player god act to benefit society or himself?

![Illustration](/img\sketches\playergod-stargazer.jpg)

In a computer game, civilization is the players responsibility. That's why the player god controls all the levers of power like what science to research or where to build new homes. In reality, we change society when we buy clothes, do car maintenance, and build a home. Funny to think about, but our everyday choices determine what happens in our entire civilization.

You can see this perpsective in this pandemic. Will enough of us decide to wash our hands and self-isolate to "slow the curve"?

It's an open question. Because we often don't think of ourselves as being "player gods." Regular people often forget how important their actions really are. But that's the big picture. It's all our individual choices that make up the player god in our real-life game of civilization.

The more individuals realize the big picture and act like their actions matter, the happier their society. And the job of inspiring individuals to believe in the big picture is the work of philosophy.

It's philosophy that makes people form communities. Like Nationalism did for Revolutionary France, or Communism did for the Soviet Union.

Think of the American Founding Fathers. They didn't simply force 13 colonies to come together and make a new country. It was philosophy written in many pamphlets, books, newspapers, the Declaration of Independence, and especially the US Consitution that made strangers realize the big picture. To all prosper, they needed to become Americans who believed in "We the People of the United States...".

A new philosophy is how America formed it's new political community. And this player god has been playing the game of civilization every since.

So, for those of us inside America, Canada, or any other Western Civilization country, what the heck are good political decisions today? Whos should we listen to when trying to figure out which way to steer our politics? Every newspaper, politician, and political party says they're fighting for the good of our society. But our politics have so much disagreement, how can a regular person know the difference between heroes and villains?

Today, we're all looking up from Main Street, trying to figure if Donald Trump is evil, or if the United Nations is trying to make a world government. We ask if CNN is manufacturing fake news, or maybe "all of them" are. If so, what's real news?

Our questions never stop. Should the government-run health insurance, or a big corporation regulated by the government? Is climate change real? If the world is suffering so bad, why do "green" obsessed workplaces force us to drive instead of telecommuting?

And now during this pandemic, many of us have (or soon will) stopped asking questions and started looking for better answers.

Wouldn't it be cool if we could better decide between good and bad politics? After all, we're each a part of the player god as much as anyone else. Helping people understand why there's so much hate in our politics is one reason I wrote this book. But my main motivation is creating Main Street's new philosophy.

One that bypasses today's "current events" news cycle, and childish bickering of Left/Right commentators. My philosophy gives wants you to take hold of the new digital levers of power so regular people aren't dependent on the social services of Big Government and the corporate employment of Big Business.

Because only when we control our own fates, will we finally enjoy the greater personal security, freedom, dignity, productivity, and happiness, of the glorious Internet Age.

## Politics Are a Moving Target Because You’re the One Who’s Moving

We create philosophies to organize civilization so it can "play the game". There are always plenty of philosophies to choose from. The player god—we, collectively—must pick one that empowers its members to use modern technology to solve real-life problems. Only then will society live a good life.

When a player in a computer game upgrades technology, we can see the changes. Installing a sewer, damming a river, building a road, is very obvious. But we can't see philosophy change so easily; because it's our minds that evolve.

detaching yourself from the current rulng philosophy can be hard too. Starting a new game is the best way to realie, every philosophy is temporary. We pick and choose them as we try to win the game:

For example, we all believe in a philosophy in universal equality where we all have the right of "Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." But what does that mean in everyday life? ? We invented ideologies to give people political guidelines. Conservative or Progressive. Libertarian or Socialist. Republican or Democrat. Each ideology supports "Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." But goes into detail by giving a list of specific policies to fight for (or against) like free health-care or unconditional gun-rights.

Supposedly we all want the same thing—life, liberty, health, happiness, and prosperity—right? What differs is our approach.

The video above shows a “tech tree” of new technologies, tools, civic and philosophy upgrades. All games use them to give the player the choice of which elements to use in their game.

In the real world, just like improving our technology, we also upgrade our philosophy with a “click.” Again: it’s just so damn hard to see because it’s our minds that are evolving.

The point is, even with ideologies to guide our philosophical opinions, understanding our political views is hard. We all look up at the same doctrines—we all try to "think of the big picture," yet we arrive at different answers. Our opinions are a by-product of our psychology, job, skillset, family, geography, culture, ethnicity, religion, time-period. Who can understand how all these factors intermix to make a political opinion? Why does one friend cry tears of sadness, the other of joy, on the same election night?

I can't explain it either. But I can help you understand politics today.

We live inside our own game of civilization, and inside this game, we evolve in ages. The key to undertand how we play the game is that the tech trees of science/technology and philosophy/policies are intermixed. So, when we change a technology in real-life, it has huge political consequence.

Because at the dawn of a new age, idealistic inventors create a flood of new technologies. And a wealthy establishment always fights back.

Both sides want their philosophy to click with the people and become the ruling philosophy of society. The establishment uses the rules of the old philosophy to persuade, or force, the people to keep the rich in power. At the same time, inventors distribute new technology to lure people away from the past.

And here is when everyone on Main Street makes a big choice.

Does the regular person help the protagonists evolve civilization by using modern tools to change their how the live their life, or help the antagonists hold back progress by following old lifestyles and rules?

If you stay out of the fight, you support the establishment by keeping things the way they are and are thus what computer games call a “non-playing character”. Which means you’re essentially an extra watching your civilization as if it was a movie you can’t control. That’s your choice, remember. If you grab hold of the new levers of power and upgrade society, you’re a player god, playing the game of civilization and helping society evolve.

We hit the Internet Age in 1970. Since then, hackers, geniuses, and geeks have been fighting to give the incredible power of computers to Main Street. The people who control Industrial Age technology (the eight difference bosses in _Office Space_) are fighting them off with things like fancy marketing campaigns, copyright laws, and political lobbying.

When the war arrives on the homefront, people of Main Street make a choice. Do you step up to help the heroes?

That's a choice you, the person reading this right now, has to make. It's a choice as big as any you're ever going to make. Because if we don't upgrade now, it only means your kids and your grandkids will live even unhappier lives. The burden of transforming society will only fall on their shoulders.

A bit heavy to pull on your parental heartstrings, but it’s true. Life on Main Street will keep getting worse until we upgrade to the Internet Age. We can keep evil things like debt, depression, war, and pandemics at bay only if we keep evolving our technology and philosophy to be up to par.

Don’t worry. We can finish the Internet Age upgrade. Even now during this pandemic we can start to upgrade our way of life. People only need to believe in a new philosophy that teaches us our innate power as player gods.

## We Upgrade our Politics Now, or We Lose the Game

Politics is currently quite emotional. Actually, from the disputed elections of the American government to the radicalization of European politics, I think it's better to say Westerners fucking hate each other. And many don't know why. They're just angry. And not in the "I stepped in the puddle" sort of way. Mad "because the other side is ruining everything!" kind of way.

Let’s get some perspective. Today, regular people are increasingly unhappy. To cope, we pick an ideology to help us. Conservatism and Progressivism are the big choices because both spanned the world on the back of the Industrial Age and the era of mass-production. Conservatives fight for free-markets to help society create more property, Progressives fight for property redistribution to keep our community fair. This divide causes a tug of war over regulations, tax rates, subsidies, and other government policies.

However, digital property can't be mass-produced or redistributed. Digital books, paperwork, audio, and video are automatically both. As our world becomes more virtual in the Internet Age, Industrial Age mentalities grow obsolete.

But rather than rethink hundreds of years of "Left vs. Right" politics, both sides turn extremist. Old-school businessmen keep their Conservative troops loyal with constant stories of "fighting evil communists who are coming for your money!" De-regulation, tax-cuts, free-trade are among the right-wing rallying calls. In contrast, social justice warriors keep left-wing politics exciting by "fighting racist fascists who want to oppress you!." Their choir forms around demands for climate justice, diversity indoctrination, and free college schooling.

In our communities, nationwide fascism and communism (thankfully) died decades ago. Meaning few people in Western societies label themselves fascist or communist. Left and Right call their enemies these names because neither understands digital technology helps our nation prosper (as Progressives dream) by forcing us to better ourselves (as Conservatives demand). Left and Right need to keep their believers in the choir singing against “the other side.” Fighting phantoms distract the people with great television.

Their strategy? Spectacular entertainment. Left and Right don’t want regular people to become player gods of the Internet Age. They want their supporters to stay extras in the Industrial Age. When Main Street complains about how much modern life sucks, CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, and the rest put up “Breaking News! The Other Side Is Ruining Our Country!” to distract their believers from the fact both Left and Right are out of date. Blockbuster sequels and remakes do the same thing when they jack up special effects because their stories no longer connect with Main Street.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEczkhfLwqM
_In the Industrial Age, Left and Right used to cooperate all the time. Not anymore. This video excellently shows the growing hatred between them. It's about the US Congress but applies in every Western country. Notice how the divide started in the 1970s and has grown since. That's because neither Left or Right knows what to do in the Internet Age, so they blame each other for the society's growing list of problems. Left/Right politics (both sides) is why we're increasingly unhappy._

The answer to countering hateful ideologies is to upgrade our philosophy. Sadly, in history, upgrading only happens when old doctrines kill each other off. The Thirty Years War (1618-1648) is an all too good example. This horrible war was fought during the Science Age between the kingdoms of Europe. Politics hadn't upgraded yet, so Europe was run by powerful nobility who still justified their rule using the Medieval Age philosophy of "nobles divine right to rule."

When Main Street demanded a better life, the ruling philosophy only had two options to choose from; Catholicism and Protestantism. Regular people picked a team and slaughtered "the other side" on behalf of "holy" kings. One author summarized The Thirty Years War as "a warning of the dangers of entrusting power to those who feel summoned by God to war, or feel that their sense of justice and order is the only one valid."

The Thirty Years War was extremely brutal. One in five Europeans died from it. The carnage only stopped when both sides were exhausted. The worst part was when the horror ended, the people realized they were no better off, and their problem was actually all kings. So, philosophers wrote an upgraded philosophy of Democracy, and it wasn't long until ordinary people adopted it as their new ruling philosophy. As player gods, these people fought against divine kings in the American Revolution (1776), the French Revolution (1789), and many more such uprisings afterward.

The hatred between Catholics and Protestants should sound scarily similar to the relationship between Left and Right ideologies today. Today's fights over presidential impeachments, border walls, and trigger words are a smokescreen. Neither Right or Left can see or admit; they're both very similar because both are way behind the times in our modern age.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2Pjudf0810
_This is what "Left/Right" philosophies have devolved to. This pettiness isn't politics. But because we often listen to these commentators, reporters, and columists our elected politicians are forced to care what they think. Real politics puts levers of power of modern technology in our hands. Once we demand that, so will our politicians._

## The Internet Age Needs a New Philosophy

For our society to see the big picture again, we need a new philosophy. One that looks ahead towards the boundless horizon of the Internet Age. One that considers the work of protagonists like Tesla, SpaceX, Blue Origin, as a sneak peek for the wondrous future each person should be building now, bit by bit.

I've studied this topic for years. Academically, at the University of Toronto, I worked on political philosophy, history, and innovation. But I learned far more on the frontline as a projectionist, contractor, line worker, account manager, claims adjuster, and especially when inventing a digital tool for an Industrial Age industry. I wrote this book to my fellow people on Main Street today; here's how we fix our problems and win the game.

You'll like it best if you're sick of contemporary infotainment politics but love checking-out what Elon is up to. Because you'll understand most of today's problems are—with digital technology—quite simple engineering problems. We don't have to invent impossible technology like time-travel to solve road traffic, rising health insurance costs, or personal loneliness. You'll really like this book if you know that unless we see ourselves in the video below, evolution will find someone who does.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KdE0p2joJw

That's our ancestors in the video, and it should be all of us today too. So, if you hate technology, despise your job, see conspiracies everywhere, worry about climate change, are intimidated by the uber-rich... fine, you've spotted a problem. What are you going to do about it?

I wrote this book to get you dreaming again. It's written to be like _New Atlantis_, _On Social Contract_, and _Common Sense_. All books that helped start modern democracies. They made unhappy people on Main Street realize the big picture. That our choices are our most potent political weapon. That with advanced technology, our choices are, in fact, weapons for change. And when we all believe in a new philosophy, we'll become player gods holding the levers of power in the glorious Internet Age.

Today, if we don't step up to upgrade our politics, we'll keep suffering the unknowns of a degenerating Industrial age society. We'll stay unhappy extras watching stories of phantom communists and fascists, instead of gazing up to a future as player gods in the stars.

And if we stay non-playing characters, at least with this book, our kids can read what their parents could have done as they regret the choices of player gods who lost because they refused to play the game.

## The Grand Mission of Techvolution

Writer David Mamet once said being free from trying to please a group means being open to seeing Nature. So, I embraced that idea when writing this book. Meaning, since I wrote it for myself, I didn't try to please anyone other then my fellow people on Main Street. Saying that Techvolution has three parts:

**I. A New Philosophy**: This part shows how to upgrade our philosophy to the Internet Age. Its purpose is to enable Main Street to see the big picture: that we’re all player gods who must use apps, electronics, and the internet to solve our problems. Fittingly, the best indicator of our progress, is how happy we are with our lives.

**II. Building the Life Star**: This section explains the new political and economic truths we’ll see in the Internet Age with technologies like apps, bio-monitors, and big data. With these digital tools, we’ll be enabled to create objective definitions of political and economic “right and wrong”. In short, the Life Star will do for politics and economics what scientific instruments (such as the telescope) did for physics, chemistry, biology, etc. The troubling part is many people—especially phantom storytellers of old philosophies—won’t accept what this new telescope shows us.

**III. Starting Starfleet**: Once we can see ourselves in the "Life Star telescope" we'll use tt to design digital tools detached from the Industrial Age. As the Industrial Age’s material abundance helped us live in so-called “perpetual peace,” Internet Age products will make our lifestyle one of “perpetual profit.” We’ll send the massive savings to Musk and his protegees and hence jumpstart the Space Exploration Age—or as I like to say, “Start Starfleet.”

**How to See the Matrix**: To write Techvolution, I used Aristotle's Poetics to better understand Hegelian dialectics, and then I added some evolutionary biology. If that bores you to pieces, that's cool, you don't need to read more about it. But just so you know, Techvolution is based on a full-blown philosophy that I'll explain in another book called _How to See the Matrix_.

**No More Magic - The End of Movies**: I learned about the tranistion from Industrial Age to the Internet Age, by studying the movie industry. Like Silicon Valley is today, Hollywood was once a pillar of innovation. By mastering modern technology "the movies" became an affordable and fun night out for the middle class. Now we've almost forgotten what movie seats feel like. All because the industry used Internet Age technologies to over sell blockbusters instead of telling better stories like HBO or Netflix. _No More Magic_ looks behind the curtain of a dying Industrial Age industry, and foreshadows what's to come if more of our industries don't upgrade soon._

**The 2008 Economic Crisis Was Only the Beginning**: The 2008 housing, financial, and economic crises was a big shock to most people. But it needed have been. 2008 was a lesson that we can't keep the Industrail Age alive forever.

That's why the image for this article is the people of the "player god" waking up, while the leader is looking up in sadness. His time in the sun is over. Because like the sword and septre of the Medieveal Age leaders were replaced as the ultimate levers of power. The Industrial Age levers of great bank, insurance, and other  builings, are also being replaced by a distributed economy.

I was writing this in 2006 and finished up in 2009. Like _A New Philosophy_ it says 2008 it was an inevitable death of an old age, but is more crude in doing so.  

===

_Techvolution A New Philosophy_ has a very high goal. So, I want to be crystal clear about its purpose. We're in the new and wondrous Internet Age. But we're still using the philosophy of the Industrial Age to run our society. Conservatism (1791), and Progressivism (1859) philosophy cards were clicked many years ago. It's thus no longer good enough for Main Street to watch infotainment news, donate to a social cause, march in a demonstration, and think they're improving the world.

To make a difference, we need a new ruling philosophy. One built on the accomplishments of our past, but that factors in the wondrous possibilities of digital technology. Our new way of thinking must unite Main Street to again see the big picture; that we're all player gods whose choices determine the health of our society. We must still vote and debate what's best for our community. But reaching for the Internet Age levers of power is our most potent political power. When we hold them, we, the people on Main Street, will solve our problems and live happy lives.

With great power comes great responsibility—that's why the duty to solve our growing problems also requires the freedom to choose any tool we want.

Tools can be anything: a thermal camera to spot leaky windows, the Waze app to lessen traffic congestion, or 3D printing a tool to sell to a neighbor. The desire to seek out new tools is human evolution. Civilization evolves when its members adapt a modern philosophy telling them to become a player god of the modern age. We've upgraded our philosophy many times before, and it's simply time to do it again.

_Like magic, or even the Force, this machine can make hammers, wrenches, replacement parts, and almost anything else. Using new technology is real politics. Because it promotes evolution. It doesn't matter if you thrive or die while trying. We, as individuals, can only try new ideas and see what works. Marching against climate change, or watching infotainment television is merely being an extra. The struggle with our society is regular people don't think to act like protagonists or player gods. And even worse, it's often against the rules to because Industrial Age companies want us to keep using their obsolete stuff. We'll overcome these antagonists below._

# Prologue

## Fighting For The Internet Age - Our Philosophy is Already Generations Behind Our Technology

The Internet Age seeded itself a long time ago. Starting way back in 1843, inventors like Ada Lovelace, Vannevar Bush, and Alan Turing were building the first experimental computers. At the same time, writers like H.G. Wells, Isaac Asimov, and Gene Roddenberry imagined what life would be like once the Industrial Age ended and advanced computers ruled the world.

These authors' stories, such as _War of the Worlds_, _I, Robot_, and _Star Trek_ thought of a future so hard to grasp people called it science fiction. Then came the 1970s; when personal computers, microprocessors, the internet, and other digital technology became real products, anyone could buy. Here started the Internet Age, and it transformed the world just as much as science fiction said it would.

With every purchase, renovation, and birthday gift since 1970, we've been filling our society with fundamentally different technology. It's easy to under-appreciate how just a laptop can be so many machines: a typewriter, radio, recorder, book, television, photo album, database, calculator. In contrast, mechanical tools of the Industrial Age are single-use, can't be easily shared, and need many workers and managers to work.

Corporations populated the world with mechanical products during the Industrial Age. They put in colossal production lines and supply chains that spread across the globe to maximize how much stuff we could make. This era of mass-production was so competitive that only a few companies could survive. If you've ever watched business news like CNBC, you've seen their per the minute stock price tracking. Every nuanced detail about sales and profits is reacted to. Most businesses, especially those on the stock market, must compete really hard to stay alive in the era of mass-production.

Digital devices enable a new philosophy, one that fosters not a competition, but collaboration. Using computers and the internet for online collaboration is our future because it saves us from the redundant work of mechanical tools. For example, with Wikipedia, the world can use one website for its general knowledge, instead of reprinting, shipping, and buying millions of encyclopedia books every year.

Now, several generations into the Internet Age, items like smartphones, laptops, and smartwatches are everywhere. That's why the collaboration websites like WikiHow, Facebook, and YouTube integrate so easily into our lives. Collaboration is today's big picture, the basic principle of the Internet Age's new philosophy. The people who understand this best are the open-source community.

## Open-Source Protagonists Are Pushing Us Into the Internet Age

Open-source is a growing community of inventors, designers, and programmers. They are the successors of the first computer protagonists. With honest hearts and genius minds, they're leading us all into the Internet Age. They live, breath, and promote collaboration at places like GitHub, Wikipedia, Dribbble, Udemy, Stack Overflow, Unsplash, and Slack.

These modern-day Jedi have given Main Street the levers of power we need to control the Internet Age, even if most people don't realize it yet. Most of us still think things like retail stores, manufacturing, and education are industries only for governments or big businesses to control. However, because of the open-source community, there are countless new tools for average people to take control of their work, identities, and lives. It's like Cinderella can stop praying her fairy godmother gets her past the palace gates because open-source has given everyone an invitation to the party.

Open-source heroes live to democratize technology. Every day they find new ways to distribute more levers of power to the people, letting us all share in our society's economic prosperity. Look around. Note the parents who are educating their kids on Khan Academy. The moms learning how to repair iPads thanks to YouTube videos. The artists selling their products on Shopify websites. By distributing society's levers of power, open-source has turned many Industrial Age companies, products, and professionals into needless middlemen.

The open-source community has super-charged Main Street. No longer are we bound to be extras in the Industrial Age, hoping for a better life. Now we can become player gods in the Internet Age, making a better life.

They made me a player god (and later we'll see a protagonist too). I'm a politics, history, and philosophy geek who spends far too much time thinking about this stuff. Because of easy to use digital tools I can write, research, host my work. I can very easily find world-class writers and illustrators to add a professional touch. Heck, think of the connection between you and I. You're reading my ideas with no middlemen and for virtually free.

All because open-source heroes put the power of new tools in both our hands.

The tech community calls this disruption. While disruption has thankfully torn down many gates, it mainly replaced low-hanging fruit like consumer goods. To keep ushering us into the Internet Age, we need to upgrade disruption with Techvolution. Only a society full of power-hungry player gods will finally turn the fantastic world of science fiction into Main Street's new reality. Note, being power-hundry doesn't mean being evil. Player gods are hungry for their own liberty, and hence need control over their water, electricity, and income to earn it.

Freedom needs power to defend it. Today, player gods can earn it with owning modern technology, and believing in Techvolution.

_Open-source loves to topple gates and let anyone post their blogs or music videos. However, levers of power don't always have to be complicated. That's why modern political "power" isn't dictatorial power over our neighbors. Player gods are hungry for their own libery and thus true power are the necessities of life. This makes is so much harder for dictators to control you and your community. And, happily makes disasters less scary._

## Mass-Production Replaced by Mass-Collaboration Helps Us Thrive

As a kid, I helped my family clean office buildings. My simple role was to pick up the garbage and recycling bins. Other than still hating the smell of old coffee, I really appreciate growing up doing honest work. Years later, when working at a big office, the cleaners were short-staffed for a few weeks. Management spent hours meeting about and discussing the “garbage problem” instead of just wrapping it up (pun intended) and moving on.

This sort of mentality unearthed a long time ago. The Industrial Age started when the steam engine powered the world’s first production lines of wheels, lathes, drills, and presses. Even with this mechanical power, mass-producing trains, clothes, and newspapers needed a lot of manpower. Workers were machines who needed managers to be micro-managing task-masters. There was no other way to be sure all workers were coordinated to the strict rhythmn of the production line. For example, in early auto assemlbl plants supervisors would inspect toilets after workers used them to be sure they're were lying.

Sounds ridicules and mean, but it shows how important coordination was. Workers were merely extensions of a great machine. Any kink in the chain was a delay in the assembly line that might cause the whole factory to stop. Look below, and you’ll see a how our factory working ancestors lived.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(76.67% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/ObedientNiftyBlackbear' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='70%' height='70%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p> <a href="https://gfycat.com/obedientniftyblackbear"></a></p>

Today we don’t work on the assembly line with bulky steam engines or massive presses. Much of industrial production is automated (or, sadly, outsourced). Most Westerners work in the [service economy inside in hospitals, retail stores, or in an office](https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/employment-by-major-industry-sector.htm). And especially since personal computers, smartphones, and high-speed internet got so cheap and common, many workers don't need to work shoulder to shoulder anymore.

Yet, we still value micro-management. In fact, to earn a better living usually means to "move up" and get a higher position, despite the fact people aren't machines on a interconnected assembly line.

It's time for todays workplaces to transform the same way the manufacturing already has. We modernize them today by empowering workers and customers to collaborate directly. Just as the Industrial Age enabled mass-production, the Internet Age enables mass-collaboration.

Main Street is already starting to collaborate. For example, when we Google something, the advanced search engine isn't giving us the answer. It's helping us find answers other people have made on their own websites. Google is great precisely because it facilitates mass-collaboration. What prevents this kind of efficiency at work is the holdover of excessive management.

For example, prior to the Industrial Age, when you spoke with an innkeeper, taxi driver, blacksmith there was nobody "above" them except perhaps the owner or master craftsman. Every worker had a skillset and was the controller of how to use it. These specialists were accountable to their customers, co-workers, and their sense of craft. It was only when industrialization gave the levers of power to factory owners, that our economy lost these specialists, and we got a work culture of "workers" and "management".

Modern digital technology, however, flips the power dynamic.

That's why Airbnb gives innkeepers, Uber gives coach drivers, and Etsy gives blacksmiths back the levers of power and let's them run their own business again. The Internet Age will continue to distribute the freedom to work alone or in smaller gorups to other specialists like programmers, underwriters, and contractors.

Liberating more individuals is how the "player god" of the Internet Age will get populated.

This change can't happen soon enough. Our culture of micro-management by layers of management is rotting our economy. While we'll always need mentors, authority figures, and administrators (especially in massive industries). Since 1970, there's been a huge bureaucratic creep throughout our economy. For example, in 1994, famed aerospace engineer Ben Rich (who created stealth technology) said only about 45 percent of a procurement budget is actually spent producing the hardware. The rest goes to bureaucratic madness. Which is why development costs of fighter jets increased by a factor of 100 since the 1950s.

Today there’s an entire class of "eight different bosses": consultants, administrators, managers, and executives who don’t know the skills of their respective industry like nursing, engineering, and (definitely not) cleaning. Their power is simply to keep the Industrial Age mentality alive by creating, distributing, and monitoring things like regulations, manuals, and memos.

![old philosophy in a new world](/img\diagrams\GWRegStudies-PagesPublishedinFederalRegister-6.12.19.png)
_Federal government regulations. An example of all the rules our bureaucratic establishment makes._

For historical context, in 100 the Roman Empire ruled over a third of the worlds population. The era of "Roman Peace" was a time of prosperity not seen until about 1700. And the Romans did this with only several hundred state bureaucrats (source). Cities and their peoples largely regulated their own lives. Not a direct comparison since our world's are much different. But that should make you think. Meeting a Roman bureaucrat was us meeting a physicist. They're out there when needed, but aren't relied up to live a daily life.

Even Roman military officers didn't have professional schools. They learned on the job, and did just fine.

We'll never be free of bureaucracy or rules. Like players on a sports team, player gods will always need administrators, leaders, and coaches. But, we don't need so many middle-men. The team can make it's own decisions when every speciality from forward, defender, therapist, ball-boy, is geared towards the same goal: win.

But that's getting hard to do in today's bureaucratic world of "eight different bosses". Which is not an exaggeration. The next time you're at a fast-food place, ask to speak to the decision-maker; you'll get a corporate directory that never ends.

Prior to the Industrial Age you'd speak with the cook or owner, get your answer, and go back to living your life. Which is also how the Internet Age will work too. Large corporations where once needed because Industrial Age technology was so bulky and expensive. But, the Internet Age democratizes technology the way blackpowder did in the past.

Regardless, today's culture benefits managers, consultants, and executives. Thus, they want to keep things the same. And this creates much antagonism—primarily because we can see mass-collaboration of frontline specialists working already. It typically goes by the name “Wikinomics,” and it’s sweeping through our economy. In addition to popular apps like Airbnb and Etsy, there are countless examples in the open-source community alone. Each open-source project showcases mass-collaboration. The community comes together to make a core technology. Groups then use the core technology to create specialized products.

For example, a large open-source community creates MediaWiki software. Then separate groups use MediaWiki to create Wikipedia, WikiHow, Fandom, and any other website you can think of. After all, MediaWiki is free for anyone to use however they want; gatekeepers be damned! And this aspect of mass collaboration hasn’t just been embraced by programmers. Mass-collaboration is how the Wikipedia community of writers, researchers, and editors wrote millions of articles in only a few years. It’s also how Linux, Android, Chrome, and many other excellent services work too.

![old philosophy in a new world](/img\diagrams\techvolution-open-source-projects.jpg)
_Some of the more famous open-source projects. Most of this software, worth many hundreds of billions, you can download and use for free. If you can't program, it only takes hiring a few to get whatever product you can imagine._

All this praise doesn't mean open-source communities are perfect and can run the world. Open-source is only a part of the ecosystem bringing the Internet Age and mass-collaboration to life. There will always be significant energy, manufacturing, and mining companies with large corporate structures, mass-producing our essential products. Likewise, the government will still run social programs and install traffic lights.

Within that in mind, however, open-source is vital.

Its key value lies in the fact that nobody owns its server software, operating systems, web apps, and so many other remarkable technologies. That means Industrial Age managers can’t stop digital inventors from empowering more player gods. Whether it’s with a simple rotating list of persons to take out the trash. An app that let us rent someone's spare bedroom. An online encyclopedia with millions of helpful articles. Or software to give society internet streaming—as when a few hackers tore down “Darth Blockbuster’s” gate when he tried to keep us buying and borrowing his DVDs.

To continue opening gates, building the era of mass-collaboration, and ushering us into the Internet Age, the open-source community needs our support. We can't ask any more of them. The Jedi have done their job. Main Street needs to step up and flock to their banner and grab hold of the levers of power they've made for us.

We can, once we become player gods.

_Figma is a design tool for websites and apps. In the past, designers, writers, programmers all spoke through many managers. With Figma there are no "eight different bosses" needed.  Worker-to-worker collaboration becomes super-easy and the remaining managers can review progress in real-time. Your workplace can, and will, one-day foster cooperation like this. And it's the open-source mentality that lets us build it for ourselves._

## Fighting for The Future - The Era of Mass-Collaboration Won't Just Happen

Once upon a time, I only wanted to learn about the open-source fight. Now I, too, want to push it forward. Mass-collaboration, telecommuting, right to repair, home power generation, and real internet privacy are just the tips of the iceberg. The visions of science fiction will only become reality once we replace old Industrial Age tools. The open-source community must get political, get mad, and learn to be selfish because they’re the leaders in the age-old story about New versus Old. Industrial Age versus Internet Age. Protagonists versus Antagonists. Jedi versus Sith.

_The American Dream, if you want to live in 1969 forever. There are lots of antagonists in this photo. Newspapers, broadcasters, oil, gas cars, k-university education are among today's largest Industrial Age holdovers. Many are filled with layers of management._

The most dangerous thing right now is ignorance. People don't know about open-source or the future they're fighting for. The people are stuck fighting phantoms on behalf of outdated Left vs. Right politics. Both sides idolize 1969 because that was the end of the Industrial Age, and hence when they both peaked. Leftists think public life is one long Woodstock "activism" festival. At the same time, rightists really feel the perfect _Leave it to Beaver_ suburb will return once "the socialists" are defeated. Both Left and Right make up phantoms to keep themselves relevant.

If you’re waiting for society to change, this is your chance. Once you take the tools in hand, you'll be the player god of a new society.

To live thriving, prosperous, happy lives again, Main Street has to bypass the middlemen, and embrace a mentality that gives the levers of power to bakers and butchers over factory food owners. Tailors and sewists over sweatshops. Store owners and clerks over franchises. Engineers and designers over executive bean-counters.

We’ll upgrade our civilization when we fully enter an era of mass-collaboration.

_This is Louis Rossmann. He repairs computers—but some manufacturers make it hard to because they want customers to replace them instead. Louis advocates for us all having the "right to repair." Because of digital technology and open-source, regular people like him and his followers can band together as player-gods. Take a look, and you'll see mass-collaboration is already starting to happen on Instagram, Reddit, and Twitter posts. I admit it can be hard to spot through all the noise. But it's still there and growing._

## Open-Source Lets Us Bust Open Gates And Initiate The Internet Age

Currently, when you phone a call center, everything is recorded. The company has access to the recording; you don't. Likewise, when the employee logs in and out of the office, that, too, is recorded. Management automatically has access to these timesheets; the employee doesn't.

Access to things like phone recordings and timesheets are levers of power. They decide how resources are distributed in our society. Today management and corporations put "gates" around many of _our_ levers out of self-defense. Is there a good reason why customers can't confirm what was agreed to during their last phone call, or employees can be grilled for a long lunch when the same manager quickly forgets unpaid overtime.

A lopsided balance of power for everday events allows customers and employees to be taken advantage of, encouraging mistrust, bad products, and inefficient workplaces. Uneven power makes mass-collaboration impossible. Which is what Industrial Age holdovers want.

The greatness of the open-source community is threefold. First, it sets a great example because it entrusts everyone with all available information. Second, open-source wants more members, so the community loves to dismantle gates and distribute levers of power to regular people. And third, since no one owns open-source technology, the people can empower ourselves with levers of power, only big companies used to control. Such has call recordings and timesheets.

Distributing the levers of power moves us into the Internet Age. It treats people like adults and expects them to act like it. And if they don't, well it's not like they can complain about mistreatment. With digital technology all the records are recorded. Once they're open and transparent a disgrunntled person has to reference facts instead of conjecture and emotion.

For example, I can't lie to you about starting this book in September 2019. It's all recorded by GitHub's "version control" system. Meaning, everyday I've uploaded the latest draft to a computer that timestamps everything. You can see it all if you want. This makes lying to you, and myself, so much harder.

In my experience (and this is after processing 10,000 insurance claims) the vast majority of people just want to go on with their lives. It's only when they're misled, disadvantaged, and left in the dark that makes regular folk to lash out. Open information, with easy to follow rules, are reasonable and thus gets the most out of people. Especially because it rightfully makes cheating too hard to bother with.

People working for apparently unselfish reasons is not new. Evolutionary biology is uncovering ever more ways humanity is often altruistic and self-governing. Early America was blessed with communal barn-raising, quilting societies, and fraternal associations. Open-source software and mass-collaboration simply adopts the same incentives. Because once our basic neccessities are met, most people want to improve their craft, gain respect of their peers, and pass-on their knowledge.

Open-source hero Linus Torvalds explained it as “Money is not the greatest of motivators. Folks do their best work when they are driven by passion. When they are having fun. This is as true for playwrights and sculptors and entrepreneurs as it is for software engineers.” It's the job of leaders to inspire passion. It's poor or needless leaders who blame their workers for their own bad leadership.

Torvalds concludes by saying “What astonishes so many people is that the open source model actually works.”

With open-source we have the technology to create our own levers of power for our warranty contracts, tax-laws, employment agreements, and so on. We only need the people to step up, participate, and demand it as player gods.

Once we do, all workers—from waitresses, mechanics, and teachers—will finally end the Industrial Age. Mass-collaboration will be similar to how factories and production lines swept across our society in just a few decades during the era of mass-production. Fun and productive workdays is the world of science fiction regular people can build for ourselves. It's the only way we'll live thriving and happy lives again.

_This is the GitHub "repo" for Ruby on Rails, the free technology that runs apps like Basecamp, Airbnb, and Shopify. It's built with few memos, delegators, or garbage meetings. This is how simple and effective mass-collaboration is._

## The Context to our Story — Launching Techvolution and Making Player Gods

The middle-class has to step up and upgrade our way of life to the Internet Age. We must grab hold of the levers of power the open-source community has made for us. Only then will we live in the era of mass-collaboration. If we don't, we'll keep suffering the pains of a degenerating society. Stepping up means Main Street stops blaming phantom communists and fascists for our problems. Instead, regular people must believe in a new philosophy that makes them player gods who take control and responsibility for their culture.

The biggest roadblock to the Internet Age is Darth Blockbuster, the self-entitled holdover from the Industrial Age. He antagonizes the future by writing rules to keep his Industrial Age tools, and himself, in power. These rules are like a Death Star. They concentrate the legal departments, HR reps, corporate lobbyists of a bygone age, to keep Main Street away from a happier life inside the era of mass-collaboration. Therefore, before our civilization can evolve, we need to defeat Darth Blockbuster and blow up his weapon.

That’s the setting of your life’s story. The plot remains to be written, whether you’re brave enough to write it yourself or you’ll let others write it for you. Will you become a player god and fight to control our society’s levers of power like timesheets, health records, and power generation? The antagonists are already playing. And this battle is the game of every civilization: it either wins or dies. It’s not at all dramatic to say this; the fate of your children, culture, and civilization is on your shoulders.

I’ll explain the philosophy we need to win, but whether you decide to become a player god is up to you. If you’re ready, keep reading. It’s time to strategize.

![old philosophy in a new world](/img\diagrams\techvolution-main-street2.jpg)
_Lots of player gods have come before us. They did their job. Most recently, in the era of mass-production. Now it's our time._

## Cast of Ideas and Characters

Before you set up to the role of a player god, here are a few terms that will put us all on the same page:

===

**Player god**: Imagine a person playing a computer "civilization building" game with our society. They would hold all the levers of power and thus decide where to put roads, what food to grow, and when houses get solar panels. Of course, there is no such deity. In reality, it's the choices of individuals that decide what the community does. We decide to emit too much CO2, eat healthy good, or learn a new skill. It's only when a person takes responsibility for their actions, do they become player gods who "play the game" of civilization. _The player god_ is a community playing the game together because they're united by the same philosophy.

**Philosophy**: The largely unspoken ideals that tell individuals what's right and wrong, good and bad, in science, art, morals, politics, and economics. Inside books, declarations, and constituions philosophy is supposed to unite individuals to see the big picture and reveal how everyone’s choices matter, because everyone is a player god.

**Ruling philosophy**: A civilization's chosen philosophy. One that "clicks" for all factions/ideologies. Examples include the "Divine Rights of Kings," derived from Christian theology and used in royalist Europe; "Marxist-Leninism" of the Soviet Union; and the combination of "Right/Left" philosophies of the Western world today. The ruling philosophy is supposed to help society win the game of civilization.

**Happiness**: The test of how well the ruling philosophy is doing its job. Spending quality time with family, having good friends, working a steady job, being in good physical and mental health, and looking forward to the future are all signs of (genuine) happiness.

**Rulebook**: The written and unwritten social, professional, and legal rules that govern everyday life. People write the rulebook by interpreting the ruling philosophy. Some examples are city parking by-laws, workplace seniority rules, and environmental regulations.

**Technology**: A catchall term for things we make tools from, like concrete, lumber, nails, shingles, insulation, and bricks.

**Tool**: A catchall term for things we create with technology to solve a problem, like guns to kill bad guys, books to record and pass on knowledge, and houses to shelter in. We use tools to evolve.

**Levers of Power**: The most powerful tools; the ones that control society. In Civilization games, these are the buttons, toggles, and sliders players use to play. In reality, levers of power are the tools that power, educate, inform, feed, and transport resources in our society. The more levers a person controls, the more self-sufficient they are, and hence more free to become a player god.

**Frontline**: The point of contact between a tool and the problem. Nurses giving vaccines, cleaners cleaning a city bus, and soldiers on the battlefield are all examples of frontline settings. People on the frontline work on Main Street with jobs that solve specific problems with a proven skillset. Frontline workers physically hold the levers of power, but don't always control them—they will, once the era of mass-collaboration starts.

**Hierarchy**: A power structure that manages every lever of power's use by society. Kings and queens with the keys to the castle, or the corporate ladder at Blockbuster controlling DVD rentals, are examples of past hierarchies. As hierarchies grow, they get more detached from the frontline and start forming gates to protect their tool being replaced as a lever of power. People in the regime give themselves titles like prince and executive, baron, and supervisor to mark their position—and, in a sense, their territory and "rights" in the power structure.

**The Game of Civilization**: The invention of technology, and the creation of tools, to overcome frontline problems. Civilization develops new technology in ages. As new technology makes new tools, these tools in turn create new levers of power which inventors use to open the gates and topple the hierarchies of the prior era.

**Protagonists**: People who invent, spread, and use new technology for the greater good. Usually close to the problems on the frontline, they individually struggle. Still, their continued self-sacrifice slowly improves life on Earth. I call them this world's Jedi knights. We call their leaders trailblazers who often skirt the rules. Galileo, Nikola Tesla, Michael Faraday, Jay Last, Grace Hopper, Michael S. Hart, Dennis Ritchie, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Linus Torvalds, Salman Khan, Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk are among their number.

**Antagonists**: People who selfishly defend their wealth, power, and prestige atop a hierarchy. Antagonists manage companies or institutions based on dated technologies and think that working on the frontline is beneath them. They work to control society's rulebook, so they can prevent protagonists' new tools becoming new levers of power. We don't often individually identify them. I coined the term "Darth Blockbuster" so we can.

**Extras**: Everybody in the middle of a battle between antagonists and protagonists. Because they're unattached to either side, extras can pick winners and losers. Sadly, extras don't realize their power and often refuse to accept they're living inside a game of civilization. When they do, they become player gods. If they don't, the game of civilization turns into a story they merely watch. Extras blame phantom ideologies for their real-life problems.

**The Death Star**: The rulebook when it's controlled by Darth Blockbuster. Today it exists inside many regulations, agreements, manuals, contracts, and laws that prevent new levers of power from reaching Main Street. The Death Star is currently busy trying to keep the Industrial Age alive.

**Techvolution**: A new philosophy empowering seamless human technological evolution by ridding Darth Blockbuster of his power, by giving player gods the right and duty to decide when society should upgrade our tools.

**The Life Star**: A rulebook based on Techvolution that's governed by human technological adaption and natural selection. It makes sure humanity never again creates antagonists who stall our upgrade to the next technological age.

**Plot**: Getting the extras to step up, grab hold of society's new digital levers of power, and become player gods who replace their ruling philosophy with Techvolution and thereby establish the era of mass-collaboration inside the Internet Age.

_Our civilizations have always had problems. It’s up to regular people to use new tools to solve them. Today, it’s our turn. Let’s get started. [Credit: Tech Insider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HubIBlnvko)_

The Coronavirus Pandemic is a sign of things to come. We've been running on the old ideological fumes of the Industrial Age for generations. I can't think of a better time to upgrade then now.

Unfortunately, unlike in computer games, in the real "tech tree" of new technologies and policies, we don't merely press "upgrade." When the time comes. We have to overcome the power brokers of the past. In the way of our better life inside the Internet Age is the philosophy of mass-production, Left/Right politics, and our nemesis, Darth Blockbuster.

Here's how to walk past them, and press upgrade on the Internet Age.

Walking past Lumburgh?

# ACT ONE

## The Beginning

It all started with a door in my face. And then, actually, a few more. I was either being too stubborn or too hopeful. Either way, I eventually learned my lesson. I was selling a web app that those in upper management were never going to buy.

Before you wonder, it wasn't a matter of price, because there was no price. It wasn't a question of competition. None of that either. And I can promise it worked because I had spent years in a cubicle doing the frontline job it serviced. After years of thinking about political and economic theory in the Internet Age, I'd written a book (Starting Starfleet) about some untapped possibilities of new tech like smartwatches, bio-monitors, and bitcoin. I only made this simple web app (using open-source technologies) to validate my ideas.

I was right to. They were good ideas. I figured out how to solve a problem and save 100 million dollars, 300,000 hours of worker productivity, and even dozens of lives. All I did was enable worker-to-worker collaboration with an app that was virtually free. Why wouldn't I want to tell people about the theory behind it?

Sadly, I was a fool. I didn't know it at the time, but I wasn't even knocking on doors. I was knocking on gates. See, I wasn't talking to frontline workers (who thanked me). But to the layers of bureaucrats, lawyers, managers, and executives who were well paid to "meet, discuss, delegate" work around "garbage problems." As holdovers from the obsessive management of the Industrial Age, I went against all they stood for; solving their problems was asking them to fire themselves. Worse, I was asking them to invalidate their identity as being "superiors." It's why they put up gates to shut out Internet Age innovation. In their mind, the levers of power, even small ones, are theirs by right.

In retrospect, all this antagonism was damn exciting. I was standing at a historic moment in time. Here the Industrial Age was taking its last stand against human evolution.

That's why the head office people never said no to me. No needs a reason. Instead, they simply said it was against the rules to say yes. You know—those obscure rules, hidden inside regulations and contracts. They believed in the rules, especially the one against frontline workers acting with initiative, holding their own levers, and taking out their own garbage, so to speak.

Like anyone, I knew bringing new products to market is hard. I knew sales is difficult. I even knew antagonists exist. But I didn't realize how strongly the Internet Age was being held back. Antagonists do a good job masking their self-interest with self-righteous rules. In their eyes, I wasn't an innovator helping his society win the game, but just an "uppity extra" stepping out of his place in the hierarchy.

I don't want to dwell on my experience too much. All that's important is this. There was a huge problem costing millions of dollars, weeks of workers' time (lots of it unpaid overtime), and maybe even your life. And it was against the rules to solve it. Even if I had won this battle for the Internet Age, it would be a tiny victory.

So instead, I'm going to talk about winning the war. Our hospitals, schools, repair-shops, government bureaucracies—our entire way of life is being held back from the Internet Age by a group of self-entitled holdovers of the Industrial Age.

To help us win the game, I learned my lesson and wrote this book. Because despite already having the digital technology to improve our lives, antagonists maintain gates all over the place to protect the pre-digital "Woodstock of 1969" way of life. They know—even if subconsciously—they lose their coveted managerial status, executive positions, and superiority complexes in an Internet Age mass-collaboration economy. Being held back from this brighter future is why our lives can be so unhappy. To improve our days then, the people need a new ruling philosophy... one that says improving our society is the only rule that matters.

## To Upgrade Our Civilization We Need To Reach for the Tools

Do you love stories? I think it's a safe bet to say that you do. Who doesn't? They entertain us after a hard day of work, bring us together to share our joys, and (my favorite) open our minds to the different rules, philosophies, and technologies of foreign cities, mythical worlds, and galaxies far, far away.

Stories are so powerful because they're so simple. Protagonists are good because they want to fix a problem. Antagonists are bad because they don't. Stories aren't debates. We take the protagonist's side. Thus, Romeo and Juliet's love is beautiful and worth dying for, while their families' feud is ignorant and stupid. Luke Skywalker's rebellion is righteous and worth fighting for, while Darth Vader's empire is wicked and should be destroyed.

Our moral clarity about a problem turns the protagonists into our heroes and the antagonists into our villains. We follow their story with strong emotions—which burst out at the climax as we find out who wins.

Our hero fights hard to defeat the bad guys, but his superior morality, justice, and heroism aren't enough. He's often too weak or unskilled, and the villain beats him bloody. On the verge of failure, the hero needs to find something that'll turn the tide in his favor. He seeks, sees, and reaches for his salvation: a tool or a weapon, like a gun, magic book, or lightsaber.

Will our hero reach it first, or will the enemy? We, in the audience, like extras in the story, hold our breath because the story's society is controlled not by marches, protests, or rules, but by which character holds the tools. The wielder is the victor. The victor writes the rules. It's the lesson that we the people need to learn for ourselves.

Because when we reach for and hold the levers of power, we stop watching our civlization on television, radio, marches and parades, and start playing it. Only then will we be player gods of the Internet Age.

![levers of power](/img\diagrams\techvolution-levers-of-power.jpg)
_Levers of power. Whoever controls them, wins._

## Player Gods Reach for the Tools and Don't Chase Phantoms

Many people know what a revolution is. The difference between it and Techvolution is a revolution fights to change the rule-makers, while Techvolution fights to distribute new levers of power. Techvolution is better. Because if you still think the rules, regulations, and laws of society control our destiny you're wrong. They don't. I'll show you why.

Talk to any political junkie, no matter when, and they'll say there's a big election coming up. They'll say something like, "if the red team wins this one, then education, healthcare, infrastructure, and everything else will go to shit." What he means is elections decide the rule-makers, and that blue rules make a good society while red rules make a bad one.

If you buy it—and most of us have at some point—you watch blue cable news, read blue blogs, listen to blue talk radio. You start seeing phantom enemies everywhere because your head is filled with blue's philosophy. Soon enough, your car has blue bumper stickers, and you're waving blue bristol boards while screaming blue chants at rallies, marches, and protests. You feel like a hero! You're fighting against the evil red philosophy!... Or, if you got sucked in by the other side, evil blue philosophy!

Let me ask you this: if you're a regular middle-class person and you ignored the election, how much would you bet that you would know who won just by continuing to live your life?

When Team Blue wins, does traffic suddenly disappear? When Team Red succeeds, does everyone suddenly exercise? Do you breathe fresher air or see fitter neighbors? Do your real-life problems get solved when one color's philosophy writes the rules?

Policies, manuals, and guidelines aren't today's levers of power. There is no law that promotes climate change, allows unpaid overtime, or encourages car accidents.

Thus, why should we use so much energy to sway government policy when we can grab hold of the new digital levers of power and become player gods who fight climate change, disallow unpaid overtime, and prevents car crashes ourselves?

If you'd rather stay an extra, you can go back to watching the pundits, columnists, and commentators telling you to fight "the enemy" until you're literally blue in the face. You can stay triggered to "hot-topics" like gay marriage, health-care reform, or death taxes.

Fighting for those policy's hasn't gotten Main Street anywhere. Nevermind the fact no matter how hard we push, the other side pushes back to our mutual stagnation. But our ability to say fight back against bad jobs, tax audits, lawsuits isn't increased one bit.

The truth is, whichever color wins an election and re-writes the rules regular people will still pay too many taxes, have a huge mortgage, waste hours in traffic, pay increasing energy bills, have credit scores controlled by strangers, sleep too little, get confused by our health insurance, apply for jobs with no information on the company's culture, endure customer abuse, get micro-managed, and hope our job (which they likely hate) isn't downsized or outsourced.

Nothing changes when Main Street elects Conservatism or Progressivism because the truth is; regulations and laws aren't strong enough to solve today's problems. To bring-ong to era of mass-collaboration, we need to create and control new levers of power.

Our politicians ignore the potential of these digital tools. And it's not their fault. Right/Left philosophies were created at the start of the Industrial Age. A time when humans only had a few tools at hand and lived on the frontier. Red/blue philosophical fathers like Adam Smith, Edmund Burke, John Stuart Mill, and Karl Marx never had running water, listened to the radio, made a phone call, opened a fridge, took penicillin, started a motor, typed on a keyboard, or learned about evolution.

![old philosophy in a new world](/img\diagrams\techvolution-mud-roads-sail-boats.jpg)
_Cutting edge technology when Left/Right was born._

Instead, our Right/Left philosophical fathers had mud roads, grandfather clocks, and abacus calculators. Being hungry and sick, cold, and ignorant was a way of life back then. That's why pure individual self-interest was so good at improving society. Individuals were confined by a desperation to improve a hard life. Right/Left philosophers used this motivation to improving their primitive world with better tools. And, truth be told, they did! These philosophies got our ancestors to agree on the same "big picture"; individuals needed to globalize the world to industrialize society via mass-production. Soon society upgraded to steam engines, sanitation systems, science labs, telephone networks, broadcast televisions, and computers the size of rooms.

During the Industrial Age, the people needed to be managed inside huge corporations and color-coded parties. Although calling exhausted farmers and overworked factory workers player gods may seem silly, it's not. Someone needed to be using primitive tools to make better ones. To their credit, blue and red philosophies gave regular people a voice in how their factories, regulations, and profits were controlled.

Today, however, we live inside the world the Industrial Age dreamed of making. We've grown a massive ecosystem of cities, factories, offices, telecommunications, and digital technology. The Industrial Age has done its job. It's time to empower the people using the digital tools they worked so hard to create.

Happily, we already are. That's the reason we're so addicted to new technology. Checking news feeds, flying drones, taking endless photos, playing hours of computer games are acts of extras mastering the tools of player gods. Our ancestors did the same when learning about printed books, telescopes, and muskets. Those were merely addictive toys until new philosophies turned them into the lightsabers that finally brought down Darth King and the Medieval Age. When regular people could read unknown history, see the universe for themselves, and revolt against royalty the game was won.

Our addicting toys are also new levers of power. They're so powerful, we can use these proverbial lightsabers to earn a happier life. We will, once we forget about Left/Right phantoms, and use Techvolution to defeat Darth Blockbuster, his Death Star, and upgrade to the Internet Age.

_Here's a sample of well-paid and respected Left/Right commentators singing to their choirs. Since ideologues can't make Khan Academy, or repair your broken laptop, or make any product you might need, they distract with bickering instead. This bullshit only works as long as you listen._

## Once We Believe in a New philosophy, We'll Reach for the Stars

Darth Blockbuster appears every time we upgrade to a new age. He works hard to secure his power by preventing regular people taking control of the new levers of power. To fight the antagonists off, we need a modern philosophy. Here's one example of it.

When you look up at the night sky, you see a dazzling show. It can seem to defy explanation. But even with the naked eye, you'll see trends. The stars never move, some "objects" (really planets) look to be wandering, and it seems like the Moon, Sun, and everything else revolves around you. With all this evidence, our ancestors were sure Earth was the center of the Universe. So much so, it was a pivotal part of the "Divine Rights of Kings" philosophy that ruled European Kingdoms starting in the Medieval Age (500-1400) and even into the Science Age (1543-1687).

When you look at the night sky with a telescope, like Galileo (1564-1642) did, you see it differently. Jupiter has moons, Venus has phases, and it looks like Earth is just another planet. When Galileo told everyone these facts, the "divine kings" were threatened. By using a telescope, Galileo was saying, "we don't know until we test, so let's use instruments to test what we think we know." Scientific inquiry questioned the ruler's divine leadership. Although Catholics and Protestant political leaders hated each other, they worked together to suppress Galileo. Neither facilitated the new truths his new tools were discovering.

Galileo is just one example of how an establishment finds it very hard to embrace a new era. The lesson is, to enter into a new age, civilization can't just use new technology. Main Street must welcome a modern philosophy too. Today we're also using an outdated philosophy from a Bygone Age. Here's an example of how that's hurting our everyday lives.

Space travel is a significant step for humanity. It means better satellites, worldwide internet accessibility, and ensuring intelligent life doesn't put all its eggs in one earthly basket. All possible _if_ we can build an affordable and reusable rocket.

Left/Right political culture was unable to meet the challenge. They can gossip about speeches, but rocket science doesn't fit into soundbites. It was new companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin (funded by a few protagonists) who answered the call. They harnessed digital technology and fostered collaboration to make rockets 10 times cheaper. The protagonists even learned how to land their rockets so they can be reused! Think about how cool it to land a frickin rocket. But many people, especially Left/Right politicians, still didn't care.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/GaseousAgreeableEarthworm' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

_Please enable the sound. This was when SpaceX landed its first rocket. This was a significant step for the Internet Age in our real-life game of civilization. Notice how happy those people were too, hint for our live using mass-collaboration._

When you're dependent on old philosophies, you're also confined to its old tools and live within its old narratives. Today Left/Right politics obsesses over tax cuts, health insurance plans, pages of government regulations, and endless media soundbites because their philosophy says these are society's only levers of power. New and super-powerful technologies like landing rockets are talked about, but more as a novelty act that falls beyond the believers of old philosophies comprehension and comfort zones.

That's the power of philosophy. It tells people which tools are important, and which should be ignored. Today, Industrial Age philosophies hold back the incredible, world-changing, happiness granting potential of the Internet Age. Up and down our economy, we emphasize government policy, mass-production, and heavy management practices when mass-collaboration is far better. The lesson is, once we believe in a new philosophy that embraces the Internet Age, we'll control our society's true levers of power, and soar to the stars.

![old philosophy in a new world](/img\diagrams\techvolution-missing-the-boat.png)
_Here's when SpaceX landed its first and second rockets. At the exact same time, Bernie Sanders was ranting about regulation battles with Wall Street. I happened to be following him, so I don't mean to pick on him, but he should have been taking a minute to appreciate all the new solutions SpaceX just opened to humanity. The middle-class needs to stop putting their faith in old philosophies and instead become player gods with the amazing new tools digital protagonists are giving us today. Like we followed Galileo generations ago._

## Techvolution is a Fight as Natural as Evolution

Fighting to upgrade our ruling philosophy is a classic human story. It happens every time we start a new age. It happened when Galileo fought a religious establishment with a telescope, George Washington fought a political establishment with a musket, Steve Jobs fought an economic establishment with an iPod.

We are embracing this history. But note that this is not a book about how to invent tools. Amazing books like _Rework_ and _Zero to One_ already do that. Nor is this a book about the history of digital inventions; _The Innovators_ does that better than I could dream of doing. And if you want brilliant critiques and commentaries of our society, _The Incerto_ and _The Great Degeneration_ are waiting for you.

This book is about pushing us into the Internet Age with a new philosophy that encourages our evolution. Nature thus inspires Techvolution. Notice that gatekeepers don't exist in our world's ecosystems. Evolution doesn't have anyone telling a cheetah she's running too fast, that the ants are too cooperative, or that a camel is too water-efficient. Individual lifeforms adapt to their own problems. There are no non-playing characters, middlemen, or gatekeepers, just problem solvers. And only the best problem solvers live on. That's why making better and more powerful choices is the Nature of politics—because you're a lifeform who should be free to adapt like any other.

Human biological adaptions take so long, however, that ours have effectively stopped. We'll never biologically evolve to fly, do advanced calculations, or breathe Martian air. Humanity continues life's evolution with tools. We're basically cyborgs who adapt by upgrading our tools to the latest problem. Hold a spear, then a gun, an abacus, then a calculator, an airplane joystick than a space ship joystick, and you're a different and more powerful cyborg each time.

Nonetheless, our problem solving is held back when the power of bygone age holds back civilization's upgrades. This is the equivalent of Blockbuster getting to write rules to keep us renting DVDs instead of saving time and money with YouTube and Netflix; basically, the opposite of evolution.

This classic battle between old and new, good and evil, fills our stories from Greek Mythology to Shakespeare. Today the most famous story is Star Wars, so I use it most often in this book. Star Wars is about a galaxy with an all-powerful energy field called the Force. Luke Skywalker's Jedi warriors' harness "the light side" to help others. Darth Vader's evil Sith lords' harness "the dark side" to help themselves and hurt all who oppose them.

In our world, we call our protagonists "trailblazers." But we don't have a political name for the antagonists. Gatekeepers are often corrupt, but these people are sometimes just doing their job. Thus, I collectively call the antagonists to our technological evolution Darth Blockbuster: people who actively and knowingly prevent human evolution for the sake of their self-interest.

Since biological adaptions and upgrades are evolution, I've called human technological evolution Techvolution. This book is about inventing Techvolution, the new ruling philosophy empowering Main Street to solve problems with technology as smoothly in human society as other lifeforms do with adaptation and natural selection.

## Taking an Uber, Learning About Collaboration

Have you ever taken an Uber? If you haven't, it's a smartphone app that connects a person needing a ride, with a person willing to drive them. So say Julia needs a lift. She opens up Uber and inputs where she needs to go. Uber assigns Jack to pick her up. Julia and Jack are now connected and can see each other's history, rating, vehicle, and GPS location. And the best part, all the rules they need to follow are taken care of within the app experience.

As Jack drives Julia, they can talk or not, it doesn't matter. Once there, Julia gets out. Uber manages the payment, and Julia and Jack rate each other and then go about their lives.

That's an Uber ride. And if you've ever taken one, you've participated in mass-collaboration as an Internet Age cyborg. Seriously, think about it. Julia needed to get somewhere, and Jack helped her get there, and they collaborated using smartphones.

Once upon a time in the Industrial Age, this coordination was done by many managers at the taxi, media, and automotive companies. Driver timesheets, dispatch call-centers, complaint resolution, company marketing, vehicle licensing. In the Internet Age, all this paperwork is handled by Uber's (mostly open-source) software. The company Uber still has to staff managers, marketers, executives, and whatnot. But the proportion is far less.

While Darth Taxi-Cab tried to stop Uber in court and government lobbying, it didn't work. Once people use mass-collaboration, it's too practical to be stopped. It's something to keep in mind while you're reading this book. Our way of life will get better. It'll get better much faster once we realize our actions, even if just catching a lift, upgrades our civilization to the Internet Age. Taking an Uber is how easy it is to become a player god.

Also, notice how similar apps like Door Dash, Uber Eats, Airbnb help "the little guy" use open-source software to share resources once only open to big taxi, fast-food, and hotel companies. With all this in mind, it's time to meet the hero of Techvolution. The one who'll bring-on the era of mass-collaboration for the player gods of Main Street by defeating evil Darth Blockbuster.

_An Uber ride is collaboration. The Internet Age empowers Main Street to keep cutting out the middlemen. Fittingly, I got these images from a free image service called Unsplash.

## Nice to Meet You, Stargazer

You're the hero! You're the one who can bring happy lives to Main Street. If you go for a jog, you just upgraded society's health statistics. Walk to a friend's house, you've lowered traffic and socialized your community. It's my mission to make you realize you're the player god capable of so much more.

That's why, whoever you are, and wherever you are on this Earth, I'm calling you Stargazer. It's a name in honor of ancestors like Copernicus, Bruno, and Galileo, who toppled Darth King by simply looking up at the stars and asking questions. These giants took on the responsibility to advance civilization and let evolution deal with the naysayers.

You can topple Darth Blockbuster. Not only do you already wield much power with eReaders, smartphones, and hi-speed internet, you hold the strongest lever of power ever. From hospital cleaners to internet technical support, from civil engineers to insurance underwriters, you are at the frontline—the place that creates political power.

I'm being very serious Stargazer. Remember, when I said, "power is to politics what money is to finance." Well, being on the frontline is why you're so powerful. You are society's nervous system. Feeling the pain of real work tells you the exact tools we need to finish the Internet Age upgrade. Darth Blockbuster will never understand what you know. So, while you're taking hold of the new levers of power, all the antagonists can do is play defense.

That's why you, Stargazer, are the hero of Techvolution. That's the way it should be. Average Joes and Janes are always the heroes. Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Neo, and Cinderella were all regular people feeling the pain of real-life. Heroes aren't born. They're stargazers, dreamers, believers, and achievers. They become heroes when they step up to defeat the bad guys. I'm like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Morpheus, or the fairy godmother, merely a guide teaching you how to overcome the villains. So, the time is now, Stargazer, to leave the farm and join the rebellion.

The rebellion I speak of might be different than what automatically comes to mind. It is not a physical revolt. It does not involve rallies, marches, or protests. It's a rebellion of the mind. The Internet Age is held back by Darth Blockbuster and his Death Star rulebook. To earn our happiness, we need to turn you into an Internet Age player god. But to do that, you have to feel the click of "Eureka! I'm the player god. I'm the one who must evolve humanity to the Internet Age. Or we lose the game of civilization."

FIGHT CLUB-IN MY HAND?

## Techvolution Builds on the Past

The world's on your shoulders, Stargazer. But let's take a minute and ease some of the burdens. First off, the world is always on your shoulders. Organizations like "the government" and "the market," say they're always going to be there for you, but we all know that's a marketing promise more than a reality. Being a player god means taking extreme ownership of your life because your actions are always the best way to improve your life.

Exercising, saving for a rainy day, helping a customer understand their loan application, buying locally grown produce. These are actions of a player god. And they're not that complicated. So while yes, being a player god is hard, it's also rather straightforward. And many of us are doing it already.

The difference with Techvolution is, we expect ourselves, and each other, to bring on the era of mass-collaboration. Vitally, we also demand the freedom to take responsibility for our home and work lives whenever a Sith Lord says helping our society is against the rules.

But none of this means you Stargazer have to re-invent society. We aren't throwing away any philosophy you, or anyone else, may believe in. Old philosophies, Protestant/Catholic, Right/Left among them, will always teach us lessons, help us do our jobs better, and enlighten our personal opinions. The ideals and openness of Progressivism help bring new peoples into the Western culture while giving a helping hand to those already inside. The practicality and steady hand of Conservatives help ensure our society keeps working and doesn't derail from too much idealism. Moreover, each side has an immense understanding of complex fields like monetary policy, farm regulation, labor relations, and more. This single book can't replace all that knowledge. It would be laughable to suggest it could.

Moreover, and this is the crucial point for people inside the government, Techvolution frees you to start solving problems. Ideology already dies pretty quickly when entering government. Seeing "the books" of massive unfunded social programs alone is quite sobering. Antagonists block practical solutions to tgovernments problems—whether it be stubborn teachers unions or corporate lobbyists—as much as they hold back Main street. When I say Left/Right politics, it's usually not those inside the government but outside ideologues with a simplistic view of our world who I take aim at. These are the people who radicalize what is still a well structured political system.

![protest](/img\diagrams\protests.jpg)
_Unhelpful radicals. They're trying to improve the future with the philosophy of the past. When they fail, they blame the other side. A new philosophy needs much personal reflection._

The solution to radicalization is giving power to the frontline. Like voting our interests in elections, we, the people on the frontline today, need the freedom to decide which tool best solves a problem. The right and duty to evolve must be our new ruling philosophy. It's the only way the player god's "nervous system" can adapt better solutions to our problems.

We're already starting to use digital tools to improve our lives. YouTube product reviews. Quora questions. Cutting cable cords and using Netflix. By controlling modern tools, the middle-class is starting to take control of society's new levers of power. Wanting to control more is the rebellion inside our mind we need to establish the Internet Age.

That's why controlling tools is the Nature of all political battles. Whether in galaxies far far away, street fights in parking lots, wars between nations, or your own life. It's why antagonists make new tools against the rules. And why I needed to write a book to remind everyone philosophies and rules are supposed to empower player gods to push human evolution, not get in its way. But since many rules stall the Internet Age upgrade Stargazer, we must pack our bags, rally our friends, and get ready for a fight. It's time to blow up a Death Star.

_Compare this person to Leftists marching for "climate justice" or Rightists for "lower energy taxes." Isn't this the person you'd want to play your game of civilization? A regular person using a modern tool to improve his energy efficiency, increase his power, and improve his society. And once we've done our daily work, we can play basketball, watch a movie, or do whatever else we want. We just shouldn't chase phantom communists or fascists. We're better off sealing or replacing our, or someone else's, drafty windows. And if you think government regulations should force people to act like this, you'll end up fighting them. It's better to think of ways to make it easier, and more profitable, to make good decisions._

# ACT TWO - BLOWING UP THE DEATH STAR

## When Rules Are In Our way, We Use Evolution to Defeat Them

Life's been evolving for billions of years. Humanity continues life's evolution by creating technology. We develop new and better tools in stages like the Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Industrial Age. Unfortunately, transitioning between stages is hard. Human Nature being what it is, the powers of the old age hold back the modern era. Since entering the Internet Age in 1970, Darth Blockbuster has continuously defended his mechanical tools by making digital tools against the rules.

Some examples. In the 1970s, AT&T defended its telephone monopoly by successfully lobbying the American government to ban internet modems. In 1984, the broadcast television industry tried to ban video cassette recorders (VCRs) and only lost by one vote in the Supreme Court. In 2001, the music industry defended compact discs (CDs) by successfully suing Napster for giving people digital songs. Likewise, Tesla, Uber, Airbnb's most significant competition has been in the courtroom. Throughout society, antagonists have found rules that force people to keep using Industrial Age tools.

City by-laws, industry certifications, insurance regulations, labor laws, government lobbies full of lobbyists, the mountains of red-tape; the endless pages of today's rulebook is our society's Death Star because Darth Blockbuster uses it to prevent new and better technology reaching the frontline. But before you face Darth Blockbuster and blow up his superweapon, Stargazer, you must learn what weapons you have at your disposal. The most formidable? The all-powerful energy field inside every lifeform. No, not the Force. I'm talking about evolution.

_I don't want to personify Darth Blockbuster. But here's an ad for an online investment brokerage. I have no idea if they're any good or not, but the ad displays the scenario that makes a person think, "how can I stop this change from happening." Once typical and esteemed positions of the Woodstock 1969 way of life, like reporters, professors, brokers, are facing this scenario and most choose to fight back. When you hear resistence, you should respond the same way a Leftists does where here racism, or a Conservative does when hearing socialism. Because empowering Main Street with Techvolution is the only way we overcome this selfish—albeit understandable—side of human Nature._

## The Magic of Evolution - How Evolution Works

Evolution is life's secret weapon. It empowers life by giving every new lifeform a slightly different variation. With variations, life can continually test for environmental changes in things like water levels, temperature, and food supply. These changes create daily frontline problems like being cold, hungry, or slow. The variations that can't adopt a solution die off and the fittest survive. This natural selection finds which lifeforms are best adapted to represent life on Earth.

Evolution works so well because it creates biodiversity. Biodiversity means life can grow its nervous system and probe the environment for changes. The more lifeforms feel the pain of frontline problems, the sooner life can adapt a solution.

Evolution may not be the Force, but it's positively magical. In tune with Nature's own special rhyme and reason, evolution turned a lifeless planet into an oasis of many different ecosystems. The big drawback is time. Biological variations can take millions of years to respond to environmental changes. Think of the poor polar bears. They'll never understand why Arctic ice isn't reforming as massively each year. And even if they could, no lifeform can proactively change their biology.

In contrast, humanity can change—not our biology, but our "cyborgology," if you will. We have the power to feel frontline pain, reflect on its causes, and create a new tool to overcome the problem (hopefully, we can do this in time to save the polar bears). That's why you are so important, Stargazer. Your unhappiness is pain, and life uses pain to determine what tools to evolve. The game of civilization is the game of life.

Techvolution is, therefore, intentional evolution. It's a more advanced and quicker way to adapt that isn't a magical mystery, as natural evolution is to polar bears, but is instead something we can understand. The question is, what drives us to become player gods and evolve life on Earth?

## The Majic of Techvolution

We call someone a _genius_ when he or she uses existing technology to make a new tool. Happily, these trailblazing protagonists are self-motivated, and we already celebrate their intellect and innovations. But innovation isn't the only step toward Techvolution. We only truly evolve when regular people choose to use a new tool.

For example, think of computers. Before they could change the world, people needed to learn to type; which takes many frustrating hours. In fact, when stuffy Xerox execs (all males) saw the world's first personal computer in 1977—the Xerox Alto—they refused to try it out. The photocopier was the future of office work they said, and besides, "typing was women's work." Happily, many Alto engineers fled to Apple and helped invent the MacIntosh. The point is if everyone refused to learn to type, computers would be useless. Society only upgrades when individuals learn and integrate new tools into their lifestyles.

So, what trick does Nature play on extras to reach for new tools when they would be risking Darth Blockbuster's, or in this case, Darth Photocopier's, ridicule, or wrath? The answer is a force found within us all.

Unlike evolution, the trick is not actually akin to magic. We, humans, understand we're dropping one tool and familiarizing ourselves with another, like when swapping out typewriters for personal computers. Yet there's still something wonderfully mystical about choosing to leave one's comfort zone to learn a new cyborgology. I call it majic; it's pronounced like magic, but spelled differently to note a critical difference: majic is the free choice of a regular person to proactively and intentionally evolve, even if they don't fully understand how they're upgrading civilization. Majic encompasses our yearning to explore, to learn, to grow, to live to our fullest potential.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/BrokenElderlyFallowdeer' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p> <a href="https://gfycat.com/brokenelderlyfallowdeer">via Gfycat</a></p>
_This is truly majical._

We usually underappreciate how joyous it is to learn new tools. But every time we try, we're like a drowning desert fox wearing fins and goggles, yelling out, "I'm getting better!" as he fulfills his dream of learning to swim. Pushing our boundaries is what life is all about. It's majic that keeps us jumping back into the water and out of our comfort zone. It's the majical joy of overcoming obstacles, learning new skills, and starting over, that keeps us playing the game of civilization.

Techvolution is the ruling philosophy that encourages extras to "majically" bond with any tool they want so they can solve frontline problems as player gods. Yet what do we do when the Death Star says improving society is wrong?

**Majic**: The natural inclination of a person to learn, use, and hold new tools to increase their natural abilities. Majic inspires people to become player gods who solve frontline problems and thereby help humanity win the game of civilization. A majician teaches other people new tools.

_Charles Darwin famous finches. These birds are adapted to eat one type of food like bugs, seeds, or nuts. After years of study, Darwin explained the differences using his theory of evolution (1859). Humanity mimics evolution by inventing and using new tools. Since we can drop and pick up tools, we can evolve so much faster than other lifeforms. It's majic that keeps us evolving._

- Note: Majić is my family name. I lucked out because it reads like "magic" in English. It may seem egotistical to coin "majic" as a term here, but I couldn't think of a better work (I swear). Primarily, the use of "majic" pays tribute to my parents. If you've liked this book so far, probably yours as well.

- Sticking it to my personal Darth Blockbuster makes me smile too.

## Using Majic to Filter the Rules

Despite our problems with our current philosophy, society always needs one philosophy that reigns above the rest. We use a ruling philosophy to create the ground rules that glue us all together. Without a ruling philosophy, there would be no player god. The game of civilization would be a story of chaos.

Darth Blockbuster uses the Industrial Ages ruling philosophy to write rules to keep the tools he commands, and therefore himself, in power. Corporate manuals, university "academic standard" guidelines, social justice blogs are among the pages of his Death Star that's getting in the way of the people majically bonding with Internet Age tools. But how can a regular person pinpoint a rulebook as a Death Star? Darth Blockbuster doesn't tell people he's Darth Blockbuster. Instead, he says he's the prince or the executive, an earl, or a consultant. Are these people genuine authority figures in society, or antagonists protecting their paychecks?

It's essential to filter out the good from the bad rules throughout our everyday lives. It takes practice, and it demands cultivating our integrity and inner truths. Yet it's a struggle that's been taking place for centuries. As an example, you needn't look further than this story of a Maryland farm boy named Frederick, who was born approximately two centuries ago.

===

Our story is about a Maryland farm boy named Frederick using tools to overcome ignorance. His farm is one of those you might have seen on shows like _Little House on the Prairie_. Salt of the earth farmers raising crops and families in 19th century rural America. No internet, no school systems, not much to learn but how to survive with your hands and the fortune God gave you.

Frederick worked the fields with his mother. It was hard labor of course, there weren't many machines around, so he had to work hard, for himself and his mother.

In a few years, Frederick was sent to work with a relative in Baltimore. The house was large, and the young family could use help cleaning, shopping, doing chores. It made his mother happy he wouldn't sweat so much, yet Frederick was a farmer and unsure of the big city.

The patriarch of the house was named Hugh. He wasn't around much. His new wife Sophia was. She was a foreigner used to colder climates who didn't know many people yet, so she stayed in a lot. Sophia was nice and treated Frederick nicely too. Not as a farmer, but as an interesting person. She made Frederick feel at ease.

One day, Sophia handed Frederick a list of items to pick up from the store. Frederick's eyes looked down, his shoulders slouched, like a dog who disappointed its masters. Frederick mumbled, "I can't read."

"My God, well that won't do!" Sophia responded, then continued "Reading is good. How else can a person give and receive information from... from... the world! I'll teach you; we'll do it together." So, Sophia taught Frederick to read. Just a few weeks, and he got the basics. Sophia was a majician everyday, and was overjoyed.

Frederick even more so! Finally, all those markings in the store, on street corners, in books, in newspapers, in the Holy Bible, mean something, a new world! Go left, turn right, open, closed, discounted, welcome, and Salvation, all words that open a new world.

Now Frederick danced to the store, he whisked himself to do his chores, because he was learning to read a little more every day. He loved how the world kept getting bigger, and information kept pouring in.

One day Hugh came home early. He saw Sophia and Frederick reading at the dinner table. Hugh walked into the room. "Boy, get out, and wait in the hallway. Face the wall."

Frederick got out, went outside, and faced the wall. Seconds turned to minutes. Frederick rolled the newspaper in his hands tighter. He didn't want to go back to the farm. But even more, he didn't want his angel to get in trouble.

Inside the room, Sophia was curious, "What is it?." Hugh responded "This isn't Ohio... Darling you can't do that. We could get in a lot of trouble. You can't teach them to read."

Sophia responded "everyone learns to read in Ohio."

Hugh takes a seat. "This isn't a free State. He is a slave. What do you think happens when slaves read? Don't you think they'll start thinking?" Sophia's eyes went wide. Hugh continued "It's against the rules to teach a slave to read... now teach the boy."

As Frederick heard the hallway door open, he straightens up, and grips his newspaper.

Sophia says "Turn around."

Frederick does, and looks at his angel, the one who talked with him like he was a person. And she looked back and only saw _her boy_.

Sophia slapped the newspaper from her boy's hand. He didn't let go. She slapped again, and again and again. Each slap hurt more than a dozen whips on his scarred back.

She slapped, and slapped, and slapped, and slapped. Sophia was told her (new) society's ruling philosophy. Now she knows what evil is and she will not do it. She will use the Death Star. Sophia then and there became a demon protector of vile racism to justify human slavery.

Frederick's world shutdown again. The one white person ignorant enough to treat him like a person, was now an educated convert to the rules that put him into chains. Physical chains if needed, but evil prefers mental chains of ignorance; they stay on so much easier.

Weeks later Frederick was still in despair. His daily routine was the same. Yet, working under demonic masters is just different. He didn't dance to the store, he didn't whisk to do his chores, and he never saw Sophia smile again. Demons are never happy because they're always on guard.

One day while doing his chores, Frederick saw a newspaper, the avenue to knowledge whose path Frederick was once on. He looked at the markings, saw some words he knew, and one word he didn't. Yet he still stared at it. Why?

The answer slapped him harder than the demon ever did, he read the words "The Free States in the North." He heard the word freedom before, but he didn't know freedom was a real place.

A shockwave went through him when he realized if slavery was a place, then so must freedom be a place too. Frederick realized he could break chains! Because ignorance was always his demon, and knowledge was always his angelic lever of power. And he fought ignorance, and received knowledge, whenever he read.

So, Frederick taught himself to read. He practiced with innocently "ignorant" white kids on the streets. He practiced reading items at the grocery store. He practiced on every street sign. And he practiced every time he was at the Baltimore dock; did you hear me Stargazer, the dock I said, you know the place, where ships will take you anywhere in the world. If you can read the schedule.

One day Sophia waited for her boy to return. But the boy died when the man Frederick Douglass walked onto the ship headed north to freedom. The man knew the exact time, place, and fare he needed to get on. He read it, himself, on the schedule. Reading opened the world to Frederick, and now the free world was opened to him.

The story gets better. Frederick Douglass wasn't happy just reading, he becomes a world famous orator and writer whose actions changed the game of civilization. In a world with no radio, video, or telephones, he travels the Northern States and Europe telling everyone the truth about slavery. When the American Civil War (1861-1865) broke out, his books helped Britain reject recognizing the South, and thus deprived it of much needed support. The irony of a slave educating people about slavery, and thereby helping to end slavery, is the cherry on top of this great story.

_This is a diagram of the story. A technology comes with a philosophy. And each philosophy has its protagonists. The people are in the middle. If they stay as extras, antagonists win. If we become player gods, protagonists win._

===

Frederick Douglass was a true Jedi Master. His exceptional bravery, persistence, and intelligence showcase humanity's endless potential. He became a protagonist who convinced extras to become player gods and upgrade their society's ruling philosophy against vile racism. His books were levers of power that changed the world. He also helps us learn Stargazer to use majic to tell the difference between good and evil rules.

Sophia taught Douglass to read. She wasn't told to. She did it because we love teaching our chosen tools, whether they're pen and paper, new apps, or how to tape drywall. It's as natural to spread our cyborgology, as it is for a species to propagate their biology.

When a magician makes a playing card disappear, we smile in awe and childish wonder. That's cool, but nothing new was created, so we soon lose our joy. However, when a majician connects someone with typing, programming, or reading, they've similarly performed something awesome. They've upgraded someone's cyborgology, helped them solve problems better, and effectively created a new and improved person. This makes us smile for a long time. In short, majic is Nature's long-lasting dopamine fix to motivate us to keep playing the game of civilization.

Yet human-made rules _sometimes_ say upgrading to a new tool is wrong. Medieval parishioners couldn't read a science book, French peasant farmers couldn't have a musket, a 1990's kid couldn't download a digital song. Today millions of tired working moms can't telecommute.

Rather... the tired mothers can, they all have high-speed internet and home computers, but they don't. The question is: why not?

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(76.67% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/AncientEnviousHornshark' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p> <a href="https://gfycat.com/ancientenvioushornshark-voldemort-potter-harry">via Gfycat</a></p>

There is no easy answer. Remember in no story does anyone ever say they're evil. Society's rulebook will never call itself a Death Star. The lesson Stargazer is it'll never be easy to know the difference between good and bad rules. Anyone can proclaim rules. Even kids on the playground can say "only tall kids can play," and others, based on personality, will obey or rebel.

Majic is thus our best judge of the rules. Majic feels right. It naturally makes us smile. It improves us and our way of life. From teaching a kid to walk to teaching a grandmother to "Skype in" and watch her grandkid's first steps. Teaching and learning new tools always open our hearts because it turns us into player gods. It's why we build things in civilization computer games while no game is about holding back progress.

So, when you're teaching or learning a new tool and someone steps in your way with a rule, ask yourself if you feel happy. If you do ask the rule-maker why he doesn't. Perhaps there's a good reason. But keep Sophia in mind. Performing majic made her feel good while following the rules only made her feel safe. The Death Star operates by fear, majic by joy.

Safety is fleeting Stargazer. Human rules are created by hierarchies, which topple with every new technological age. Thus all rulebooks eventually expire. Majic never will. It always was, and always will be, in our souls as we play the game of civilization. Majic is how we naturally test human rulebooks. Electricity, the microchip, the iPhone were all made by people who broke the rules. Yet we celebrate their innovators Nikola Tesla, Robert Noyce, Steve Jobs because they invented new tools that let us feel and spread majic today.

Ignore majic at your peril. Sophia gave one of our greatest writers and orators his start. Yet she lived a miserable life watching him achieve greatness. It's a lesson for us to take in when we're stuck in traffic, stuck in a meeting, or doing whatever else is giving us such unhappy lives. We're miserable because we're extras of the Industrial Age. We aren't free to play the game of our civilization. It's a fun, challenging, and rewarding life to live. This is why we need Techvolution. A modern philosophy that says being a player god is fun, and holding back majic only bring unhappiness.

_The joy of majic. This YouTuber learns new skills then posts videos of his experience. Look how happy he is once he finally does it. We're unhappy today because our workplaces still treat employees like cogs in the era of mass-production. In the Internet Age, we all should be learning new tools to improve things on the frontline in the era of mass-collaboration. If someone holds back majic at work, it's a good sign they're the ones with the problem._

## Now We Know the Difference Between Good and Bad, It's Time to Use It

Stargazer, you're not Frederick Douglass. You're not enslaved, beaten, or being chased. But that doesn't mean we should be happy with our lives any more than Douglass should have been content with his personal freedom. Our society needs player gods to solve today's frontline problems. That means you have to follow majic and grab hold of the Internet Age levers of power.

One big problem arises. Sometimes we feel the wrong majic, and therefore don't see, nevermind fight for, the levers of power. Darth Blockbuster is sly. He knows we love new and exciting technology. So he co-opts majic with an unnatural and anti-evolutionary force. One I call dark majic.

## Dark Majic Masks

In Nature, there are continual adaptations of existing lifeforms, and then sometimes entirely new lifeforms. In Techvolution, this is the difference between upgraded technology and an entirely new tool.

Upgrading a technology, such as going from sedans to SUVs, VHS to DVD's is a small change. While each product is different technologically, they do the same job. All things considered, their users have the same powers and are thus the same cyborgs. The point is, a brand new technology doesn't start a political battle. The Death Star isn't fired up, so to speak.

But when we've upgraded enough technologies, like microchips, touchscreens, batteries, and Wi-Fi, a protagonist can unlock a new tool like smartphones. New tools solve problems in a new way. And this is a big deal.

![New Tool Creation](/img\diagrams\techvolution-new-tool-creation-pc-s.png)
_New technology is continually invented. When enough separate technology is invented, a new tool is created._

Because new tools prompt a question: who controls it? After all, whoever does is more powerful. While the game of civilization is the struggle to overcome problems by upgrading technology and inventing new tools, politics is about the battle to control them. The people with the old tool fight to retain their power. While the inventors, innovators, and majicians imagine a new society that shares it.

Darth Blockbuster will use society's rulebook to suppress new tools. But lawsuits, lobbying, and other techniques take time and money. It's better for the antagonists if Main Street's love of majic is misdirected for the love of old technology antagonists still control. For example, muscle cars today keep customers away from Tesla with techniques like mass advertising, fancy auto shows, and spectacular chromes plated V8 power! Tesla's are a new tool because they can be fueled using renewable energy. With a Tesla Solar Roof, they can even be driven with ones' own power. But people are prevented from seeing this majical potential by antagonists anti-evolution techniques. Which is why I call them "dark majic."

Dark majic is the spectacle that surrounds today's Industrial Age tools. Soda commercials and credit card rewards are easy examples. This fake majic is insidious. It gives people the joy of learning about technology but doesn't upgrade their cyborgology. Like a corrupted rule book, dark majic stalls our society in the game of civilization. To destroy the Death Star Stargazer, we have to first learn to ignore evil dark majic.

**Dark majic**: Methods and techniques to keep a person using an old tool. Dark majic gives regular people a false sense of joy and accomplishment, so they don't upgrade their cyborgology and become player gods. A dark majician tricks people into being extras.

## Dark Majic

I've processed about 10,000 car accident insurance claims. While claims get quite emotional, sometimes, the task is straightforward. Drivers call a call center, claim adjusters (me) ask them questions to get them back on the road. The job is mostly filling out paperwork. One question showcased how deeply our society can fall for dark majic.

Among the many questions, I had to ask customers about their car's color. I'd often hear something like, "it's midnight summer blue." Being somewhat a jokester, I'd play around and ask, "you sure it wasn't sunrise winter blue?". And the customer would almost always reply with, "No, it's the midnight summer. I'm positive."

My chuckle would turn into amazement when I'd ask about the other car. I'd almost always be told, "I have no idea." It was a pain because my job was to get this information. But even though they'd were just in a car accident together, customers usually didn't remember a thing about the other car. I mean nothing. Not the make, model, color, not even if it was a sedan or SUV. When a driver ran into a horse, they'd remember lots of details, but a car? Usually, I'd have to write "unknown" and move on.

We think our vehicles are so unique and special. It's not a car, it's "The original Sports Activity Vehicle®: a fearless leader and stylish benchmark. A BMW x5Drive50i, with Phytonic Blue Metallic paint". I'm not kidding. People would talk like that. And not know a thing about the other car. Which, of course, means the other person didn't know anything about their car.

And that's dark majic. Because a person is living in 2020 but acting like it were 1930 when cars were new and majical. The first cars upgraded people used to walking around or waiting for buses. Buying vehicles for the first time meant these new cyborgs could happily cruise around, take family road trips, visit faraway friends. Cars were a significant transportation upgrade, like us getting hi-speed internet for the first time.

But today isn't the early 20th century. You're not in _Grease_, _American Graffiti_, or _Rebel Without a Cause_.

_Professional driver on a closed course. And still, a gas car, with four wheels, probably stuck in traffic._

The truth is cars aren't new and exciting. They're already integrated into our lives. More chrome, keyless entry, leather interior are refreshing, enjoyable, but in the end, they don't really matter. You're the same cyborg with almost any car. My customers admitted as much, because after an accident, what they wanted most of all was a rental car. Fancy features and made up colors didn't matter; they just needed to get around. Dark majic turns us into introverts who think we're controlling levers of power in the game of civilization as important player gods. In reality, we're really just non-playing characters living in the past.

The Industrial Age powers want to distract us with false luxury. To be a happy community again, Main Street has to wake-up to dark majic and survive the Death Star. Let's see how we did against Darth Blockbuster himself.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/HarmlessBlueFanworms' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

_Please enable sound. Most of our physical infratructure was built in the late 1800s early 1900s. Not having to pay this massive cost is one reason baby-boomers could afford their expensive Woodstock lifestyles. However, like Right/Left politics, our infrastructure is also well past its life expectancy. Which means while bragging about our luxury cars, we've let the roads, bridges, and tunnels their driving on fall a part. Building infrastructuree is the most important thing about civilization games. If neglecting ours in the Internet Age in favour of 300 horsepower sports cars of the Industrial Age isn't proof we're extras instead of player gods, I don't know what is._

## Darth Blockbuster Uses Dark Majic and the Death Star

Industrial Age industries use dark majic to keep their customers attached to an aging product. Today's Hollywood, with its remakes and franchies, is a great example. But Tinseltown didn't start out that way. It actually started by people fleeing the patent trolls of East Coast companies. These antagonists would shake-down early filmmakers so much, all the filmakers fled as far as they could, the City of Angels.

Hollywood started making silent films. By the 1930s, projector, sound, and film technology were quite advanced. So much so, that master storytellers like Samual Goldwyn, David O. Selnick, and Irving Thalberg could make movies a worldwide sensation. Like Steve Jobs created apps that glued us to smartphones, these creators made a Studio System that glued people to theatre seats.

Over the next decades, things changed. Television came in 1948, which obviously hurt the movie business. Worst was the government (foolishly) made a rule banning studios from owning, or even collaborating with, movie theatres—which broke up the studio system that worked so well. By the 1970s, the movie industry was in trouble. It was good movies like The Godfather (1972), Jaws (1975), Star Wars (1977) that brought some people back to the theatre.

By this time, the movies were no longer run by master storytellers. Businessman obsessed with mass-production had taken over. The industry lost its ability to tell original stories. Instead, they made sequels, remakes, and franchises. Each new release had to use more raunchiness, special effects, and celebrities to attract attention.

Here's how screen legend John Wayne explained it in the late 1970s:

  > All the real motion picture people have always made family pictures. But the downbeats and the so-called intelligentsia got in when the government stupidly split up the production companies and the theaters. The old giants like Mayer, Thalberg, even Harry Cohn, despite the fact that personally I couldn't stand him—were good for this industry. Now the goddamned stock manipulators have taken over. They don't know a goddamned thing about making movies. They make something dirty, and it makes money, and they say, 'Jesus, let's make one a little dirtier, maybe it'll make more money.' And now even the bankers are getting their noses into it

As all this was happening, the entertainment industry tried to ban VCRs. After they lost, the public kept buying videotapes because they liked watching content on-demand so much. Enter Blockbuster. Blockbuster rose to VHS rental dominance by using bar-codes to keep track of thousands of videos. This let them carry far more titles and be timely enough to charge lots of profitable late-fees. VHS rental business was so good, business-centric Hollywood started to use theatres release to hype up their more profitable movie rental business.

Then came the DVD and flatscreen televisions came (1999). Hollywood's businessman were gleeful. As the public crazed over home theatres, they bought billions of DVDs to watched their favorite stories at home. So popular were DVDs that many theatre chains—despite jacked-up popcorn prices—went bankrupt in the 1990s. Hollywood didn't care; they kept making spectacular and raunchy franchises and remakes to sell more DVDs.

The public ate it up. The movie industry took credit for the surge in business. But while the audience seemed happy with the dark majic of movie blockbusters, there was more behind the story.

Fundamentally speaking, movie theatres and home theatres, are both gates. A customer still needs to drive to pick up a DVD like they do a film reel. And here was the sweet spot of the Industrial Age powers. With the DVD, the industry could use digital technology to lower the costs of mass-production, while still charging premium prices required for a physical product.

The sweet spot wasn't going to last. Because true to the game of civilization, technology kept getting better. Soon enough, hi-speed internet (2004) finally came to Main Street. Now the public didn't have to drive to a theatre or Blockbuster store. Now regular people could share in the benefits of the Internet Age; home internet streaming was finally possible. And predictably, a new tool asked a substantial political question, who controls the internet streaming lever of power?

![Techvolution battle](/img\diagrams\techvolution-battle.png)

I was a theatre usher/projectionist back then and saw it all first hand. Some movies were great, but most were bland: comedies, tragedies, dramas, suspense, all usually fell flat. Theatres were over-priced and often empty. Customers were unhappy, and often told me so. The industry didn't care. They gave themselves lavish paychecks, banquets, and award shows. Any consideration of upgrading their customers to the Internet Age was not-existent.

The industry wasn't going to throw away the DVD. Instead, they double-downed on it. Twice! They made HD-DVD and Blu-Ray (2006). They increased the dark majic of marketing, special effects, and celebrity culture. The Hollywood hierarchy was happy the way things were. They (thought) they controlled the digital technology lever of power. Their business model was to ration access with structrued theatre, DVD, and television release dates with orchestrated advertising campaigns and  exclusive celebrity interviews.

In swoops today's internet Jedi on an ethernet chandelier. Unknown and unpaid technologists created BitTorrent sites (2008). Although filled with computer viruses, lousy picture quality, and poorly designed user interfaces, these sites gave regular people movies on the internet. With the lever of power in both hands, DVDs faced off against internet streaming.

A decade before the music industry was in the same spot. Record stores and CD sales died when customers got the internet and flocked to torrent sites like Napster. Music executives tried—and failed miserably—to make their own online music platform. When the great Steve Jobs created iTunes to help save the music industry, the executives still didn't want to share power over the music business. Jobs said this about his experience, "I've never spent so much of my time trying to convince people [music executives] to do the right thing for themselves." Eventually, Jobs got them on board, and the iPod, iTunes, and AppleMusic are, of course, history.

The movie industry rejected the lesson of Napster. Ever notice how online movies don't include opening credits, red-carpet interviews, and politically charged speeches. When the public controlled the lever of power, the first thing they did was erase this filler because its useless dark majic. When in control of their stories, the public downloads the simple majic of a new story.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/PleasantRegularGibbon' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

_Fan reactions of another generic blockbuster movie versus Game of Thrones. Or, dark majic versus majic._

When DVDs and dark majic lost out to the majic of streaming, the industry fired up the Death Star. The same public who bought billions of dollars on DVDs and merchandise. That was paying 800 million a year in DVD late fees. That created fan clubs and flocked to comic-cons; was declared evil. The movie industry put FBI warnings on their products, lobbied the government for harsh punishments, and demanded the public feel ashamed for not buying DVDs anymore. Customers were sued, threats of lawsuits were mailed out. The industry refused to do the hard word and evolve. Instead, they called their own customers' disloyal thieves.

And here was born Darth Blockbuster. Hollywood leaders were actively and knowingly trying to force humanity to keep using old tools in our cyborgology. Rather than sending us quality stories over the internet, Hollywood demanded we keep buying for Blue-rays. But before we find if the villain could save the DVD (I know you know the answer, but indulge me), let's take a short break.

![Frontline movies full](/img\sketches\frontline-movies-full.jpg )
_Today, most movies stink, and most theatres are dead. That's you Stargazer, looking at the frontline after removing the dark majic mask that had you watching pompous banquets giving out awards to movies you've likely not even seen._

# Intermission

Intermissions are an excellent time to stretch our legs, buy a snack, and also ask some questions about the story so far. Here, I want to define more terms, characters, and emphasize why reaching for modern levers of power solves our problems and makes us happy.

## Recap

The game of civilization never stops. It goes on forever because it's the game of life; evolve or die. Thus, we're always that person on Main Street trying to figure out what's right for ourselves while trying to help our society prosper. I think we all try our best. We try to educate ourselves, eat well, use green products, and join movements like sustainable agriculture and renewable energy.

That's good news because even though human evolution is (currently) hard to see, we're still nonetheless playing the game. We simply have a huge problem—we're running out of time. Western Civilization peaked in the Industrial Age, and we haven't updated our ruling philosophy to the Internet Age. Still obsessed with the era of mass-production, we've been digitizing our society using ideas designed to industrialize it.

That's why still measure our success by the Industrial Age stats like GDP growth, employment numbers, Dow Jones Industrial Average, union membership rates. These numbers don't tell us anything about ourselves. They don't say if we have more savings, better-maintained infrastructure, fewer heart attacks, more reliable medical supplies, or if we're living happier lives.

The Internet Age gives us the power to start measuring our happiness and therefore our civilizatoin's health. To get there, we have to finish our upgrade with the "click" of a new philosophy. One that says improving our lives is our right and our duty.

![US-VMT-per-capita](/img\diagrams\US-VMT-per-capita.png)
_You'll never hear this stat on CNBC, but it means so much wasted times and money. It's a number we'll be talking much about in the Internet Age._

## The Rulebook

The rulebook is what governs everyday life. Since entering the Internet Age, our rulebook has kept growing. Government regulations have shot up, political correctness is spreading, office workers toil to get absurd certifications. And think of this, business lobbyists didn't even exist in 1969, now many people think they run our governments.

Our rulebook is enormous, and you're probably used to it being over your head. We've all signed loan contracts, terms of service, credit card agreements without reading them. We live under so many by-laws, regulations, and laws nobody knows how many. We buy products filled with so many copyrights, trademarks, patents that it's hard to understand how much of our stuff we own. We live under the jurisdiction of a massive rulebook. But big isn't always bad; it is, when the size is used against us.

## The Death Star

A big rulebook makes our rules so convoluted they become open to interpretation. Today, it's lawyers who benefit most. They interpret laws and argue for one side in a dispute, and thus have the power to decide the winner and loser. But big is still not automatically a Death Star.

It became one when Industrial Age powers wanted to keep themselves in power. Far removed from the original industrialists, they relied on controlling existing levers of power, and not inventing new ones. They wanted the era of mass-production to never end. This scene from Mad Men, taking place in 1960, shows it well.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKcneQ6N50Q&feature=youtu.be&t=50

You can see this same conversation at a car, clothing, appliance, entertainment, cosmetic, and other once upon a time cutting edge companies. After the Industrial Age ended in 1969, they wanted to keep their time in the sun going. To do so, the juniors of this world, with no idea how their industry worked, or how to make anything new, paid for more "mad men" dark majic shows. And when that didn't work, a large, confusing, and ever-growing rulebook became their superweapon to defend their gates against new technology.

Only established Industrial Age companies had the money to buy the lawyers who could interpret the rulebook in their favor. Henceforth, the massive rulebook of society became a Death Star to the Internet Age. Leaders like "junior" became Darth Blockbusters, who held back evolution for their self-interest, not caring that his antagonism made life ever unhappier on Main Street.

## Levers of Power

In the Industrial Age, when regular people thought of politics, they had to think of ideologies. This was because government policy was society's biggest lever of power. To have any say in what that lever did, Main Street could only support Right or Left.

The Internet Age changes the power dynamic. Now when you think of politics Stargazer, you should not think of ideology, nightly news broadcasts, or what commentators think. You must think of of apps, websites, and electronics. These are the new levers of power. Thus, the most important political question of our time is asking "who controls mine?".

The middle-class can start to control their society with water reclaimers, home agriculture, solar panels, and records of communication. Once we believe in Techvolution, we'll be player gods in our minds. But only when we control our own levers of power, will we be player gods in reality.

## Polar Bears in the Amazon

The era of mass-production is over. But politicians went along with Darth Blockbuster's antagonism. Instead of adapting solutions to local problems, we've replicated past products and tried to live with the unhappy outcomes.

Our society used dark majic to try and make people happy. Thus, to look like we're improving education, we put up more prestigious colleges. To deal with traffic jammed and decaying roads, we sold more luxury cars. To make people "happy," we built more glamorous generic suburban homes.

![suburbs](/img\diagrams\suburbs.jpg)
_Can you guess where these pictures were taken? Mass-production brought mass-uniformity that's very unusual in our history, and in Nature._

If we saw a camel drinking from the Great Lakes, eagles flying inside a cave system, or polar bears swimming in the Amazon, we'd stop and wonder, "why are these biologies here?". Likewise, when we see the same modes of transportation, working hours, and houses, in Boston and Phoenix, we should see something is out of place. Different geographies, demographics, and weather give different problems and thus give custom biologies. So, we should also create custom cyborgologies for the same reason.

If you're asking how our cyborgologies should evolve, I don't know. That's your choice. It's up to free lifeforms to adapt. I am sure an archeologist digging us up would have a heck of time telling the difference between Miami and Toronto, or Auckland and Calgary lifestyles. We have none of the splendid diversity of life in Nature, the ancient world, or Middle-Earth. (This is a hint of the beautiful place we'll build in the era of mass-collaboration and enjoy in the lands of perpetual profit.)

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(54.69% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/BriefPersonalAlleycat' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p> <a href="https://gfycat.com/briefpersonalalleycat">via Gfycat</a></p>

The Western world's mass uniformity is why we're unhappy. We're forced to live in a world so interconnected with "just in time" economics our lives have little antifragility. One plant does down, one port is closed, one virus pops up and the world feels massive pain. All because we're unfree to adapt our housing, work schedules, transportation methods, food supply, power generation etc. to our local environment.

Keeping the era of mass-production going gives us a easy life in the good times, but great fragility when anything goes wrong. We're as unhappy as a camel would be if forced to live in the Amazon.

It's expensive for a lifeform to live a life of fragility outside of its ecosystem. That's why despite disagreeing on everything else, our politicians have agreed to keep borrowing more money. They want to keep the Industrial Age, the era of mass-production, and their ruling philosophy alive. Unable to adapt is also why regular people have so much debt.

In short, can you imagine all the money a polar bear would owe trying to live in the Sahara? Or a camel in the Amazon? You don't have to, just look down.

![Government debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_debt#/media/File:Consumer_and_Government_Debt_as_a_%_of_GDP.png)
_Industrial Age tools like suburban houses, gas cars, and junk food are too generic to give a return on their investment. We borrow to avoid doing the hard work of finding more efficient ways of living and working in the era of mass-collaboration._

## Happy Camels

What makes a lifeform happy. The freedom to play the game of life.

What holds Progressives and Conservatives back from letting us evolve locally, it's their addiction to choice. See, when Left and Right were born, the world was poor, hungry, and mostly untamed wilderness. By liberating people from the grips of the "nobles divine rights", Left/Right ideologies empowered our ancestors to tame the land with industrialization.

During that era, free choice was always connected with a real-time problem. The majic of a new tool was created because candelight, famine, or blizzards were hard to live with. But as the era of mass-production made people warm, fed, and entertained, human choices lost their evolutionary partner of frontline problems.

To make a happy camel, you need to put in its habitat. A place where it's adapted to live. And same for us. We need our own unique ecosystems, our own economies that are customized for our way of life. I call this "local need solved by local greed." It's great to make money, but only when its because of an adaption that increases the communities welfare and antifragility. That means the era of mass-collaboration will, as the saying does, "think global act local" and let camels live in the damn desert.

## Ideologues Don't Care About Evolution

Ruling philosophies are compelling. They can make firm believers of people who sometimes have a hard time applying their theory to the real-world. One example is Lysenkoism. This was a pseudo-science in the Soviet Union that assumed our genes inherit learned traits. So, for example, if you lived in a hot climate, your genes would morph to sweat more.

Darwin said the opposite. He taught us our genes are set in stone, and it's the fittest who survive. Soviets didn't want to believe that because it sounded like elitism, which their communist ideology said was unnatural. The result was Soviet genetic research didn't exist. Soviet agriculture didn't get better seeds. And thousands of Soviet biologists were sent to labor camps for asking questions.

Likewise, Progressive and Conservative extremists won't go easy. These ideologues don't know—or care—about upgrading to the Interner Age. Even now, they're fighting evolution to stay alive.

These fights get very serious—like when Europe set itself aflame in the Thirty Years War fighting for a bypassed Medieval Age ruling philosophy. Now we have enraged Progressives and Conservatives blaming each other for our society's problems. They rally around trigger words, tea-party marches, woke culture, pronouns, toxic campuses and boardrooms, and "convince me I'm wrong" trolling. These misguided people will keep raising tensions until we click a new philosophy. Watch out.

## Made In America

How did antagonists stay in business by re-selling the same products? They lowered their labor costs by exporting their factories and called it profitability.

There are endless pages of economic theory that justify exporting the American industry. All of its bullshit. If lower costs are such a good thing, why aren't trademarks, registered trademarks, copyrights, or patents filed in markets with cheap lawyers? Why aren't executives or marketing departments outsourced? Where would you rather penny-pinch, on marketing campaigns, or the person making your brake lines? Darth Blockbuster was simply selling off our factories to buy himself more time. China was especially seen as the promised land—the place of the never-ending Industrial Age and, thus, the perfect solution to Darth Blockbuster's problems.

Left and Right politicians agreed. Unable to adapt our lifestyle to the Internet Age, they saw cheap labor as a way to sustain the "American Dream" babyboomer lifestyle they sold to voters. Thus, in addition to borrowing money, free-trade was their answer to Main Street's money problems, even when it meant selling off Main Street.

But, no matter how cheap we make Industrial Age living, it's still outdated. Nature demands adaption not replication. We don't win the game by replaying bygone ages. We win by continually evolving technology and ourselves. That's why there's never been a time where the society full of marketers, managers, and economists, defeated the nation full of engineers, craftsmen, and technicians.

To start winning the game in the Internet Age, Main Street must demand more "Made In America." Buying each other's products is a great sign we're controlling our society's new Internet Age levers of power. I smile, thinking of all those bakers, tailors, designers, engineers, repairmen happily working on a new empowered Main Street.

![China comparison](/img\diagrams\then-and-now.jpg)
_A tale of two ruling philosophies. One selling itself to keep the past alive, and another moving itself forward. Thisi s America's manufacturing centres versus and China's in 1960 versus today._

## New and Old Societies As Seen in Celebrities

New technology is already changing our society. By connecting people to the internet, we've given ourselves the power to receive and send information on demand. The gates of newspapers, broadcast television, and even weather forecasts are torn down. Now the people decide what they learn, based on what they need to know.

An example of this freedom is celebrities. We'll always celebrate the people we look up to. In the Industrial Age society, our stars were often decided for us. The era of mass-production only let a few people make movies, release albums, or get their names in "the papers."

Internet Age celebrities are different. While we can make fun of Instagram models, silly YouTubers, Twitter trolls, and obscure podcasts, but at least we can follow who we want. Which also means we celebrate who we wish to. Heck, with no gates to overcome, anyone can be a musician, artist, comedian, or "celebrity." Personally, I follow people like Sailing La Vagabonde, Adam Savage's Tested, Linus Tech Tips, Kings and Generals,  Historia Civilis, The Joe Rogan Experience, Dave 2D, Kirsten Dirksen, Traversy Media, Taylor Tries, Dr. Becky. I celebrete them because they're real people doing cool stuff who'd never consider themselves celebrities.

The next time you hear "celebrity," ask yourself if they're one of yours. Modern technology gives you that power.

## I Want to Work at Blockbuster, I Want to Use Netflix

Some people call Main Street employees, consumers, and taxpayers. Those are all different names for non-playing characters because there's no achievement or responsibility required to be one. Player gods call themselves workers, owners, and citizens. These are the roles where people seek out more political power to improve themselves and their society.

With that in mind, everyone knows the world is changing. We hear a lot of the computerization of work and the end of the "one job for life" mentality. What doesn't exist is the self-realization that _your_ job is changing. There are still lots of Blockbusters in the world today. They sustain themselves on hidden fees, pushy sales commissions, and high mark-ups. And the employees inside often think they'll work there forever even though they watch Netflix every night. Employeess get to trick themselves like this, but player gods know the truth. Times are always a'changin.

This doesn't mean you'll lose your job. If you have an actual skillset, you'll be okay. You'll just have to adapt because society will eventually get just as sick paying for your Blockbuster as it did the original one.

You can't work at Blockbuster and use Netflix forever. Don't worry, they'll be lots of patriots running around, teaching you how to make a great living with modern tech.

## Modern Patriots

When I worked at a call-center, my customers often had a paper invoice or report. When I told them I needed to see it, they'd usually ask themselves where they could get a scanner or a fax machine.

I'd remind them their smartphone has a great camera—they can just snap a photo and email me. This always sparked a eureka moment; "that's right, I can do that, thanks, John!"

We know about scanning and faxing, but there's still no word for snapping a photo of paperwork. Because this new ability of our cyborgology is still evolving.

Cool huh. And that's what I mean by cyborgology and majic. When a new tool is in our hands, it gives us a unique ability and therefore increases our cyborgology. But we need to be taught how to use it. We can learn this majic ourselves, or a majician can teach us.

We'll need the help. Technology will keep getting more advanced. Someone needs to teach Main Street all the possibilities behind artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, 3D printing, augmented reality, vritual reality, and whatever else the protagonist wizards invent.

You know how we ask Home Depot workers for DIY advice? Well, who does a plumber ask about using a 3D printer to make a custom pipe? What about a roofer curious which drone and camera best inspect weather damage? How can a phyiotherapist use Machine Learning to help their client's sprained knee. While tech companies will keep making and marketing excellent products, someone has to know all the options to help the frontline connect with the majic of modern levers of power.

Linus Tech Tips is an example of someone already doing this. There's a big job for someone doing this all day; modern patriots who "cross-pollinate" products on Main Street during the era of mass-collaboration.

## Does The World Need to Know

While we should be celebrating stuff like #madeinamerica, #staycation, #mainstreet, we have to devalue the titles of many Industrial Age jobs and their dark majic consumer products.

That can be hard. Darth Blockbuster heads a hierarchy, so there are lots of underlings inside who fight his cause. Dealing with these BMW drivers, junior execs, or sales agents is sometimes rough. They define success as rising up the ranks. If you're "beneath" them, they assume they're better than you and act like it.

If they ever intimidate you, just press the button below.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random" target="_blank" class="button primary large">The Funny Wakeup Button</a>

It randomly selects a Wikipedia article. With three clicks, I got:

- Lorenz Nieberl, a German bobsledder.
- Sandamías, a village in northern Spain with 67 residents.
- Aartsenia arctica, a sea snail.

Anyone can make a Wikipedia article, so someone out there said, "the world needs to know" about this stuff. But, no one has ever thought that about your personal antagonist. You haven't, have you?

Ignore arrogant pricks. They're not even smart enough to realize their collecting and polishing participation trophies for needlessly changing the company logo, or re-writing the unread corporate manual. Now and always, its contributions to win the game of civilization that makes people think, "the worlds needs to know." Today that's whoever grabs the new levers of power and helps us upgrade to the Internet Age and install the era of mass-collaboration so we win.

## The Era of Mass-Collaboration Is Already Seeded

While the antagonists are fighting it, the era of mass-collaboration is already here. We've already seen examples of Uber, Airbnb, and Wikipedia. But there are many more. I included some  below. Not only should you take a minute to try them out, but you should also sit back and realize what you're doing. Because with no managers, consultants, and timesheets, you can work with others to advance humanity with nothing but a laptop, the internet, and you.

One day soon, your job will likewise require so little travel, stress, and time. And no, you won't lose your job. It's the head-office types, the HR reps, the eight different bosses, the people with no frontline skills who are unneeded in the era of mass-collaboration. That's why they fear the Internet Age so much.

Common Voice: https://voice.mozilla.org/en : Help inventors give their apps voice commands by donating your voice, anonymously, of course. A free voice database lets anyone improve their software.

Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com : Stack Overflow lets programmers ask a question to other programmers. The person with the best answer gets rewarded. This kind of mass-collaboration will soon connect you with other people doing your frontline job.

Wikipedia: https://wikipedia.org : Everyone's an expert at something. Starting or editing a Wikipedia page is a lot easier then you think. Try it out.

Kickstarter: https://www.kickstarter.com/ : Kickstarter connects regular people trying to solve a problem, with ordinary people waiting for a solution. You can be your own investor; a few bucks could fund a product you need. The software of this website, Ghost Foundation, was started on Kickstarter.

Naysayers will point out problems here. They'll say Wikipedia has errors, or Kickstarter funds bad products. Ignore people who find a reason the future won't happen. I mean, compare some errors and delayed product releases, to Industrial Age industries who are "too big to fail" like banks, cars, and insurance that get billions in bail-outs every generation. The mass-collaboration websites above are very young and inexpensive, yet they still put levers of power in your hand. As they improve, they will only increase your control over your slice of the world, which directly increases your political power.

Even with today's limited collaboration tools, Main Street can start working together like this example below.

_Appreciate what you're watching here. A complete internet stranger did a better design job than a professional company. With digital tools, we all have access to each others' expertise with no middlemen. This is the beginnings of mass-collaboration._

## The Era of Mass-Collaboration Is Only Waiting for a New Rulebook

Mass-collaboration makes us happy. Our happiness is a sign of a healthy society. We'll get to live in this new era, once we evolve to the Internet Age by clicking a modern philosophy and installing a new rulebook. I'll show you a more detailed example.

When we buy a new house, we can't wait to move in, bring in our furniture, and start renovations. Soon enough, everyone's putting in decks, pools, fences, sheds, and whatever else we dream up.

Take a second and watch this clip of a player building backyards in the city-builder _Cities: Skylines_.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/ClassicSecretKarakul' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Evolution needs us to buy solar-power roofs, install a Hydroloop water reuser, start a 3D printing business in the garage. These are the new technologies that put levers of power in our hands. We've already seen how we can use them to connect with each other in the mass-collaboration economy to help solve our problems.

But there's a roadblock; do you know if your home insurance policy covers hail damage to newly installed solar panels? Do you even know where to find out if it does? Do you where to get your local business by-laws, building codes, tax laws?

Even without antagonists, our society's rulebook is so vast and dense, we all live under the threat of "not reading the fine print." At any time, we could be hit by a code violation, claim denial, warranty rejection, lawsuit, or audit. And what if antagonists want to attack us? It's so easy for anyone with the resources to find "a problem" and use their Death Star to start a lawsuit, find a violation, or lobby government against you.

Technologically speaking, there's absolutely no reason for this. How is it that Linux software is worth billions, operates every Android phone, runs most of the internet's servers, and you can download it by pressing this button.

<a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/archive/master.zip" target="_blank" class="button primary large">Instantly Download Billion Dollar Software For Free</a>

But to access our health insurance policy, we do what? What does it take to get the blueprints to our home? How many people understand how their mortgage works?

The rules, regulations, contracts, and laws that govern our lives are a complete mystery to most of Main Street. And that makes us dependent on city-halls, mortgage companies, and law offices. We give these organizations the levers of power to become antagonists.

The truth is, regular people can work as freely as the _Cities: Skylines_ clip above. Like taking an Uber, or renting an Airbnb, open-source software, GPS, smartphones, high-speed internet, AES security protocols, cloud computing, MySQL databases can literally put the power in our hands!

Once we hold Internet Age levers of power, we'll make a rulebook that's friendly and reasonable. We'll always need experts. But a modern rulebook will let us check and balance each other so we understand what we should be doing. Can ask informed questions if something doesn't make sense. Are empowered to fight back if we think something is wrong. And vitally, also makes sure we're held accountable for our actions.

This new rulebook will only be a happy reality once Main Street uses Techvolution as our shield and motivation to bring-on the era of mass-collaboration. We'll talk about making the Internet Age rulebook a little later, in Techvolution II: Building the Life Star.

To get people to sign, they used BMW driving underlings to sell a confusing rulebook. By the way, the housing crisis was always going to happen. Explaining the financial crisis is where I came up with camels trying to live in the Amazon metaphor._

## Click

What makes something click in a person's mind? If only we knew. Sadly, we can't decide to cry, scream, or love. We all must wait for a connection. Here's some stand-up that'll probably make you laugh, I'll make a point afterward.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOiPQ8nqB1s&feature=youtu.be&t=15

Note, it's the extras of the Industrial Age who complain about everything because they're forgotten they can have fun playing the game of civilization.

Here's my point, nobody knows how or why something clicks. However, we do understand when it does—when we can't go back. And could you ever drop Netflix and do back to driving to Blockbuster and back (twice) to watch one movie? What about flipping through encyclopedia books, or calling a taxi-cab and wondering when it'll arrive? Of course not, and that's a good sign you're already a believer in the Internet Age.

So, let's return to the book and our mission. I want you to drop the era of mass-production and Left/Right politics for Techvolution. A new philosophy that gives you the right and duty to upgrade our civilization to the Internet Age. I want Main Street to spread their power with #debtfreeliving, #byebyedarthblockbuster, #ilovecollaboration because that's what happy player gods do when we control the levers of power.

# Mid Point

## A Techvolution Battle Scene. Wikipedia vs. Books. Internet Age vs. Industrial Age

Before we return to the battle with Darth Blockbuster Stargazer, let's get more backstory on the war to upgrade our civlization to the Internet Age. There's lots more stuff to improve then just storytelling technology; like our general knowledge.

Humanity is always asking questions. Some of those today might be, why are the movies so expensive, are candy applies real apples, or, more importantly, what are proven techniques to stop malaria infections. Humanity deal with all these questions by creating a reference tool.

Our first reference tool was the wisdom of our elders. The first technological upgrades were papyrus scrolls and ink (around 2300 BC) and books (about 300 BC), which turned some elders into experts like Hippocrates and Aristotle. When wood-pulp paper (1200) and the printing press (1456) were invented, humanity unleashed mass-produced books. Now experts could share knowledge between themselves and educate the masses. We called the reference books encyclopedias. And as Douglass already showed us, knowledge is the greatest lever of power.

That's why encyclopedias were a massive hit; up until a generation ago, many households proudly included a physical encyclopedia collection in their library. _The Encyclopedia Britannica_ (1878) was the standard. In 1933 it started to be re-published every year to keep people updated to the latest facts. When the Internet Age hit in the 1970s, home computers, digital printers, and telecommunications meant encyclopedias were written and stored digitally. But they remained a set of printed books and CD's controlled by experts.

Then came the world wide web (1991), a new technology that brought the internet, and the Internet Age, directly to Main Street. The web let anyone on Main Street send and receive information, and therefore unlocked many new tools like websites, forums, blogs, and something called "wikis." Wiki software lets anyone write or edit a webpage by pressing "edit now." All changes are saved, so anyone can erase errors or vandalism by pressing "undo now." For years programmers used wikis to write technical manuals collaboratively.

As web boomed in the late '90s, protagonist Jimmy Wales wondered if the web could upgrade encyclopedias. Today, most of us curious about things like the movies or malaria know this story ends with a free online encyclopedia anyone can edit called Wikipedia. It became the poster child for the era of mass-collaboration. But it didn't start out that way.

Wikipedia started as Nupedia (2000), a free online copycat of Encyclopedia Britannica. Nupedia followed the Industrial Age rationale of making gates. It said only "expert" professors were qualified to write articles. Wikipedia (2001) was a side project. Only the programmers, designers, innovators of the Internet Age knew mass-collaboration was the way of the future.

Everyone else didn't realize that with a new technological age, comes a modern philosophy as well. The first sign of a problem with Nupedia was that the professors didn't like to share their knowledge. In its first year, Nupedia had 12 articles. Wikipedia had 40,000.

Here rose Wikipedia's antagonists. Professors loved to belittle the public's articles as rubbish. They even used the Death Star and disallowed students from referencing Wikipedia's materials in their school work. Yet professors refused to improve, or to assign students to improve, Wikipedia. The professors also performed dark majic. Despite good referencing abilities and wide-spread adoption, they still try to convince people to not use Wikipedia. The lever of power was theirs by right.

The second sign of a problem with Nupedia was that it turned out "expert" answers, and "regular" answers are the same. The movies are expensive because of a 1948 "Paramount Decrees" banning studios working with theatres. Candy apples are real apples. And mosquito nets are a simple and effective tool against malaria.

We can all look up these facts because Wikipedia put the levers of power into the hands of player gods! A massive community voluntarily shared their knowledge one "edit now" at a time and fiercely protected their common knowledge with "undo now." Nobody told them, paid them, or made a rule to force it. Because writing or reading a Wikipedia article, is Nature's majical dopamine rush.

That's the story of Wikipedia. Invented by protagonists, upgraded to society's reference tool by player gods. Few believed it was possible because even professors don't understand new tools always unpower the few, to empower the rest. Interestingly, after I finally conceded temporary defeat to my personal Darth Blockbuster, I uploaded a few pages to Wikipedia instead. Not as helpful as my app, but it took just a few weeks of work, and one "edit now" button, to make it real. It felt majical to bypass the rules of the Death Star. It also put a big smile on my face.

## Death Star Goes Ka Boom

Stargazer, think about how important pain is in Nature. Does a penquin in a zoo evolve to Antartica's ever changing environment? Of course not, it's up to the lifeforms on the frontline to adapt, and keep the species alive.

The middle-class flocked to Wikipedia and made it a worldwide force. Then we gave internet streaming to our society. We didn't need marches or protests. We only needed to reached for new tools, hold the levers of power, and thereby evolve humanity. We destroy the Death Star when we do what's best for us. And we're right to be so selfish, because we're the ones feeling frontline pain.

Of course, the antagonists will disagree. But that's why they're Sith Lords. The formal education industry has given American students 1.5 trillion in student debt. Hollywood is given billions in subsidies despite having empty theatres, bad movies, off-shored production, and many self-congratulatory and splendid banquets and balls; not to mention a culture of tax-cheats and sexual predators.

The middle-class doesn't have ulterior motives. We are rational beings because we feel the pain of everyday life. We rightfully rejected the dark majic of Blu-ray and HD-DVD, and endured the Death Star attacks when using BitTorrent and worked to evolve humanity. And if you still doubt Main Street being inherently just, once Jedi Reed Hastings gave the public internet streaming at a fair price with Netflix (2008) the middle-class proved the frontline's superior ethics and morality because we're willing to evolve.

Look at the graph below. You'll see the Industrial Age evolving into the Internet Age because Main Street acted on its best interests. This is the power of an empowered middle-class practicing good politics and grabbing hold of the lever of power. Evolution is always right in Nature, and Techvolution is always right in the game of civilization.

    </script>

Main Street flocked to Netflix because it was a fair deal and a much better product.

During this transformation, I was one of the smucks working at the movie theate and buying DVDs when I could afford them. Like most of Main Street, I got dozens collecting dust somewhere. Darth Blockbuster was telling us all DVDs were better and moral. I wonder, do you think the Sith Lord will buy them all back? I'll talk half-price.

Notice BitTorents aren't dead. While most people don't bother with torrent sites anymore—because Netflix is so much easier and better—civilization holds torrents in reserve. Torrents check and balance the economy in the Internet Age to be sure Main Street isn't taken advantage of again. Fairness is the motivation for this insightful GIF.

![Battle Scene](/img\diagrams\checks-and-balances-storytelling.jpg)

If you're wondering, streaming companies are returning the studio system to Hollywood, except the home theatre is replacing the movie theatre. The problem is storytelling in our society is getting segmented, making it harder for us to create new popular stories that update our culture. The Studio System should never have been outlawed in the first place. But that's a topic for a different book.

## Test

Can you do me a favour. Get collet all your medical records. What, you don't have them? You don't know where "they" put them. Does anyone? Like most everyone, they're likely spread around doctors, dentists, therapists, hospitals controlled by strangers.

I'm going to show how many strangers. If you want to, you can watch this video from General Practioner doctor, but you don't need to. In the video she simply talks about her job. She thought being a doctor was going to mean fostering a solid relationship with her patients to help them live healthier lives. Instead over the years she's increasingly had administrator shoving themselves into the mix. She's complaining how unhelpful these middlemen are.

![Marie Antoniette](/img\diagrams\healthcare-administrators.png)

What you're seeing is government regulators, project managers, hospital administrators, claims adjusters, insurance underwriters, lawyers, and more meetings and manuals then anyone can imagine. All these people are middlemen who think themselves pivotal. Funny, because you're paying for these faceless administrators to keep the healthcare levers of power away from you.

Administration is probably the biggest reason for rising health-care costs. So, what's the solution?

- A. March, support, and vote for Progressive politics so they can put in a single-payer universal health-care system.
- B. March, support, and vote for Conservative politics so they can put in a private health-care system.
- C. Alternate your support and end up with a mixture of government and corporate health-care. (Which is what ended up happening).
- D. Make new apps and electronics and put these levers of power directly into doctors and patients hands. Use the ethics of open-source to give individuals power of their healthcare, but also the responsibility to become healthier.

Many health-care administration jobs are needed. Many are not. Using Techvolution, you should know the solution to this problem is changing who controls the levers of power. Only new apps, electronics, and websites made for the people, by the people, will check and balance administrators in the era of mass-collaboration and improve the health statistics of our culture.

We can do it. Wikipedia and Netflix show how the middle-class can ignore dark majic and defeat antagonists. We ignored their bad rules, and instead used the better tool which soon became the new standard. Uber, YouTube, Airbnb, Wikipedia, Netflix etc., don't give us all the levers of power. But we have a lot more then we did just a few years ago.

And yet, these cool apps are small victories. To bring on the era of mass-collaboration in the Internet Age across our entire society from health-care to working hours, we need to transform our society's entire rulebook. And that takes a bit more work.

## We've Blown Up One Death Star, Now Here's How We Win the War

So Stargazer, to turn the tide on rising health insurance costs, we'll need copy what we did with Wikipedia and Netflix. Put new levers of power in the frontline's hands. It's a battle that makes us happy because evolving humanity puts smiles on our face.

Imagine how happy we'll be on Main Street once we use digital tools and mass-collaboration to solve our agonizing commutes, confusing insurance contracts, over-consumption, and rising global temperatures. That's the war you must jump into with lightsabers a-blazin', dicing up old evil tools, to supercharge humanity into the Internet Age.

Note, our lives cut across thousands to millions of problems. Thus, our villains are not in a massive group like "the rich" or the "the unions" as old philosophies label. Our villains reveal themselves inside thousands of companies, institutions, and organizations of the Industrial Age who fight to keep their version of the Encyclopedia Britannica or DVD alive. They choose to antagonize. There's lots of work to be done and glory to be earned in our never ending game of civilization.

But some people choose to antagonize. Today, this is the entire class of middlemen, consultants, administrators, managers, and executives who don't know the skills of their industry like nursing, teaching, and (definitely not) cleaning. Their power comes from managing the gates of an Industrial Age technology.

Together, protagonists and extras can overcome these antagonists to bring on the Internet Age. I know this is possible because history has proven it. Our struggle to upgrade civilization was fought generations ago with Darth Blockbuster's master: Darth King.

Darth King ruled atop a huge hierarchy. He lived inside gated palaces, using society's money to host splendid banquets and balls. His absolute control over society's levers of power was hidden by the Medieval Age's ruling philosophy of the "noble's divine right to rule."

Slowly, as protagonists invented scientific instruments, books, and guns, the Age of Enlightenment was born. With it came values of science, equality, and democracy that turned the people into player gods in the American and French Revolutions. These revolutionaries were inspired by the new philosophy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

![Marie Antoniette](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jhgHG65hfC8/VFT1nla3p8I/AAAAAAAAfwU/8BgnOdFSelo/s1600/Marie-Antoinette-marie-antoinette-27292491-1500-1000.jpg)
_Player god, extra, protagonist or antagonist?_

## Freeing Cinderella

"Player gods are born free, and everywhere they are tricked into being extras." Rousseau said that in 1762. Actually, he didn't. He said "people are born free and everywhere they are in chains." But the idea is the same. Rousseau was the son of a Swiss watchmaker who grew up to be a famous (or infamous) writer. Infamy didn't pay much so he often had to copy sheets of music to make his rent. More than 300 years later, he is recognized as being a great philosopher, a political visionary, and a protagonist who helped free the world with his new philosophy.

Rousseau lived when kings and queens, dukes and duchesses ruled civilization. A time when Mozart played inside exquisite palaces during the nobility's many banquets and balls. This was the opulence Cinderella dreamed about about while cleaning a dirty chateau. Sadly, unlike the fairy tale, the people didn't have a Fairy Godmother to make their dreams come true. Instead, the commoners cleaned the nobles' vast libraries, used guns while dying in their wars, and were told to ignore what scientific instruments revealed. As extras in the story of civilization, they were distracted from the power of new tools by dark majic—the people believed their beloved Holy Bible said only Darth King had the right to rule.

Rousseau called bullshit. In truth, Jesus was a carpenter, a commoner just like any other person. So, why can't everyone live up to their potential and become player gods? Rousseau made people understand that books, guns, and scientific instruments should liberate the extras who were only in chains for the happiness of con artists. The self-proclaimed "divine nobility" didn't like hearing that. They declared Rousseau a banquet-pooper, a rule breaker, and chased him out of Switzerland, France, and England. Maybe that's why the genius philosopher rented instead of owned.

It didn't matter. The nobility was in the dying days of their Medieval Age ruling philosophy. Starting in 1776, within Rousseau's lifetime, Darth King started to face the music when the American people started a revolution. One year after Rousseau died, the French had their own revolution in 1789. And, on it went from country to country because Rousseau, and others like him, made extras realize they should become player gods in a country "of the people, for the people, by the people." Cinderella soon forgot about the fancy ball, and instead sung the music of freedom in a choir of equals, that sounded something like this:

Revolution spread the people's liberty, equality, and fraternity throughout the world. In a few years, the Medieval Age was finally gone. The royal Death Star was destroyed. Church and state were separate. Government had checks and balances. Civilization embraced a new ruling philosophy of Democracy. Main Street put presidents and senators, judges, and sheriffs in power, who ruled at the request of the people because the people were player gods.

Rousseau died never having found a home. After they won their revolutions, the people put him to rest inside the glorious Panthéon. He was heralded as a renowned breaker of chains, destroyer of corrupted rulebooks, and liberator of player gods with his new philosophy that said any guy can be the prince, and any girl can be Cinderella.

The question for us is, how did Rousseau help an entire people embrace a new age, become player gods, and change their ruling philosophy? I'd especially like to know how we do it better because I'd really like to skip horrible wars and revolutions as we venture into the Internet Age.

Civ6-politics+LesMis GIF

_Les Miserables is a story of antagonists, protagonists, and of course extras singing about becoming player gods. Notice after a new philosophy clicked, they made it real with that lever of power called a musket._

## Old Philosophy vs. New Philosophy

Techvolution is a philosophy book, but I don't directly reference past philosophies. Like any topic it takes some practice to read. However, I thought it might help to study a little. Below are snippets from two influential philosophers. One who hated Rousseau's ideas, and another who loved him.

===

  >SINCE the time that learning began to flourish there has been a common opinion maintained which affirms: "Mankind is naturally endowed and born with freedom, and at liberty to choose what form of government it please, and that the power which any one man has over others was at first bestowed according to the discretion of the people."

  But how this vulgar opinion has of late obtained a great reputation is unknown to me. It is not to be found in the ancient fathers and doctors of the true Church. It contradicts the doctrine and history of the Holy Scriptures, the practice of all ancient monarchies, and the very principles of the law of nature. It is hard to say whether it is more erroneous in divinity or dangerous in policy.

  This desperate assertion whereby kings are made subject to the judgements and deprivations of their subjects follows as a necessary consequence of foolhardy position of the supposed natural equality and freedom of mankind. The people do not have the liberty to choose what form of government they please.

Philosophies often live past their live expectancy. Only when the people become player gods do we get to choose which we like best. Let's see how our ancestors on Main Street won their battle against noble kings, so we can honour their legacy and upgrade our sociey today.

![Treaty of Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Treaty_of_Paris_by_Benjamin_West_1783.jpg)

_The American Revolution ended when USA and the United Kingdom signed the Treaty of Paris (1783). The arrogant British nobles were so insulted, they refused to sit with the new player gods, and so weren't painted in the official portrait. Player gods get their place in history, antagonists erase themselves. I love it!_

## Society’s Three Stories Tell Us If We're Watching the Story of Civilization, or Playing the Game of Civilization

Entering a new age doesn't require war, peace treaties, and funny unfinished portraits. Unfortunately, conflict usually tears down the old age and rings in the new. To avoid it while entering the Internet Age, we have to see our society better than Rousseau did. We can do that because we can learn from him.

Rousseau's words echo this sentiment: let society enter into the Age of Enlightenment. Let the people prosper as player gods who use modern tools to improve their work and home lives. Let the nobility return to natural equality. Let anyone lead society—if they can solve problems and thereby earn the public's approval and consent. Rousseau never said there shouldn't be leaders. He said leaders should deserve their spot in charge of the player gods general will.

He didn't phrase it like this, of course, but that's what Rousseau basically said. He understaood every new age needs a new philosophy that unites the people into thinking of the big picture and making a new player god.

But, every new age comes with a battle, because the leaders of the old way of life refuse to earn their spot. Rousseau used stories to show us how humanity transitions from being antagonists and extras of an old age, into being protagonists and player gods of a new one. It shouldn't come as a big surprise that the troublemaking philosopher was also a novelist.

So let's explain the three different stories:

**Classic stories**: are good stories about real-life problems. A protagonist—and their supporters—leave their typical day, and build up the courage to think of the big picture; either they act overcome a newfound problem or no one else will. The ice-caps are melting says the heroic polar bear, and I'm going to teach us all to fish!

In a classic story, the protagonist and antagonist repeatedly think of new ideas and act on them. No one knows who'll win, which makes the heroes all the braver for fighting. Both sides fight to create or control levers of power like magic books, big bombs, or the secret lesson that'll teach polar bears how to fish.

There's no way to know which stories will resonate with audiences. Still, only classic stories can resonate with audiences and become archetypes like _Cinderella_, _Romeo and Juliette_, _The Matrix_, and _Star Wars_.

**Art stories**: are not about any specific problem. The main character doesn't challenge themselves or rise to the occasion. They think the big picture is doing whatever they want. The main character is thus selfish and self-important; a con-artist. Not because they do not help others, but because they want to be the hero even though they aren't teaching the polar bears to fish, so to speak.

The result is stories with no levers of power. Instead, art stories showcase the main characters' idiosyncratic behavior. Art stories are surprising to the point of being weird, with a conclusion that doesn't improve the world because the main character didn't even try to. Film festivals like Cannes, Sundance, and Toronto mainly show selfish films.

**Spectacle movies**:- is about an obvious problem, i.e., Godzilla is here, so run like hell and keep running until the movie is over. Spectacle movies are straightforward because the problem is straightforward; survive or die. However, since the action is so instinctual, there's no time for the protagonist to think of new ideas. The result is logical but unsurprising stories.

In a spectacle movie, the polar bears may survive, but will never adapt a new lever of power to change their fate. Instead, spectacle movies reuse old stories and characters and tell the same story. Spectacle stories always lose interest over time, producers are always looking for new customers with hype-filled, dark majic using, mass marketing campaigns. Most franchise movies, sequels, and remakes are spectacle movies.

===

These are the three-story categories. In a nutshell, classic stories tackle real-life problems. Art stories are self-obsessed. Spectacle stories are a distraction. This is why art/spectacle stories don't have "spoilers", while we want to "go in fresh" for classic stories.

Society transitions from classic, to art/spectacle inside ages. You can see the transition most easily in your favorite sitcom, such as _The Office, Seinfeld, Friends, HIMYM, The Big Bang Theory_. They start off as classic stories, with characters who deal with relatable problems like not liking their jobs or being tired of dating. We see ourselves in these characters, so we cry and laugh because we know the stories could also happen to us too—we're living the same life on Main Street.

However, in later seasons, to keep their now popular characters alive, the sitcom characters stop evolving. Kramer can never get a job, Raj can't get a girl, Dwight can't get self-aware. Here sitcoms become art and spectacle stories. Art, because the main characters don't overcome problems anymore. And, spectacle, because we the audience keep watching our favorite actors, characters, sets, catch-phrases, instead of wanting a new story. The turning point between classic story and art/spectacle story is often called "jumping the shark".

_Game of Thrones went from great to horrible because the characters became more important then the story. Everyone kept watching though, which is why this pictures shows the transition from a majical product, to a dark majic one._

Rousseau explained how society has these classic, art, and spectacle stories, and that our communities travel through them as we develop through technological ages. When we start a new age, it's like watching the first years of the sitcom; everyone is solving everyday problems, the main characters have earned their spot; the stories are therefore majical.

At the end of the age, the leaders are self-important, and the people are only loyal out of habit. In short, Rousseau noticed how one story works to advance and help society, and the other two work to enrich the artists and distract the masses. And that's where we are today. At that's the problem Techvolution has to solve with a click.

You can see this click in the movie called _The Matrix_. It's a story about a dystopian future in which most of humanity is unknowingly trapped inside a simulated 1990's reality called the Matrix. The dream world is created by machines to distract humans while using their bodies as an energy source. It's a wonderfully believable world of dark majic—a spectacle story told to keep the selfish machines in power.

The story's hero is Neo. A regular person who asks "what is the Matrix?". His willingness to question reality, eventually gets him recruited by the few untapped humans rebeling against the machines. Neo rises to the occasion, and learns to see through dark majic so well, he learns many new abilities—so many that he even overpowers the evil Agent Smith. Neo finishes the story with a phone call to the antagonist leaders:

  >I know you're out there. I can feel you now. I know you're afraid. You're afraid of us. You're afraid of change. I don't know the future. I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how this is going to begin. I'm going to hang up this phone. And then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world without you. A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries A world where anything is possible. Where we go from there, is a choice I leave to you.

Rousseau would have been proud. But let's see, how we can learn from the French philosopher and Neo, to click our new philosophy for ourselves.

## Protagonist Kings

Not all kings are con artists. There's a good reason we tell ourselves stories of gallant knights and dreamy princesses. At first, the Medieval Age was led by heroes of a classic tale. These kings and their nobles defeated monsters to create a peaceful country for the people to live in.

In Rousseau's time, noble families ruled every European country. They had absolute power because of their ancestors. After western Rome fell in 476, western Europe entered the Early Medieval Ages (500-1000). Often called the Dark Ages because there were few books, ink, or even literate people to write anything down. In fact, maintaining the existing Roman infrastructure like sanitation, roads, and farms was hard enough. Advanced civilization was mostly gone, the levers of power of organized government were erased. Anarchy ruled where Rome's Caesars once did.

People like Clovis I, Charles Martel, and Alfred the Great took charge. They were master warriors who used swords, bows, armor, and cavalry to expand their kingdoms, keep away vandals, and fight off invading Vikings and Arabs. Even better, they headed large families who kept a growing peace. Soon they built castles to protect the newly remade cities, markets, and hospitals.

The Early Medieval Ages was a classic story because heroes solved real-life problems. They rose to the occasion, rallied supporters, and fought the evil villains with the only levers of power left; swords, lances, and castle walls. Fittingly, a hierarchy formed around these levers of power. We call it feudalism. You've probably seen it in stories like _Robin Hood_, or _Game of Thrones_. Feudalism was a rigid hierarchy of kings, bishops, dukes, sheriffs, knights, priests, tradesman, and peasants. In return for loyalty, the people at the bottom got what was called the "King's Peace." It was a good deal. The growing peace returned civilization. Soon the people had new and better shovels, oxen, thatched houses, buckets, sickles, and other tools to expand their cyborgolgy.

The first kings were basically like mafia bosses. These kings didn't rule inside an official parliament, police force, or bureaucracy. Like any literary hero, they themselves were society's protagonists; making them Protagonist Kings. This was the start of the "noble divine right to rule." The kings weren't bad guys. They had many battle scars to prove it.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/WarmJubilantIrrawaddydolphin' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

_You'd believe in holy kings too, if barbarians, Vandals, or Vikings were at your doorstep._

Under the rule of Protagonist Kings, Western Civilization rebuilt political institutions, court systems, town councils, sanitation departments. But it was slow going. By the time Western Europe had a fully functioning civilization again at the Renaissance (1400-1600), nobody could remember why the story of divine nobility started. Who could blame them, the story was already a 1000 years old. Do you remember what happened 1000 years ago?

As Europe went through the Renaissance, the Age of Science, the Age of Enlightenment, the invaders were increasingly gone, fresh water was available, the roads were clean, the markets were busy. The once Protagoinst Kings, were now merely executives of extensive and bureaucratic civilized governments. The only thing that didn't change was the culture of royalty. The leaders had the title of king but were no longer protagonists. They became villains protecting their privilege, who refused to let society grow out of the "nobles divine right to rule", and thus became Antagonist Kings.

## Antagonist Kings

By the time Europe entered the Renaissance, the system had done its job. The nobles were no longer protagonists, but merely average people who happened to be born with "noble blood." For the most part, they only waged war against each other, and usually only for personal glory or "gloire" as they called it. Otherwise, they sat atop a hierarchy who paid no taxes, did not work, and answered to no one. These antagonist nobles used relative peace and prosperity to replace armor with dresses, churches with cathedrals, castles with palaces, and battlefields with banquets and balls.

Loving life, and without opposition, these nobles conned the people, and themselves, with art and spectacle. They lived inside a self-important culture, where increasing weird behavior, childish gossip, and useless titles, was the norm. And they distracted the people with spectacle. Brilliant cathedrals, royal palaces, and meaningless wars against other kingdoms kept the masses occupied. Like franchise movies, all these spectacles got more intense to keep the story interesting.

Visit European castles and extravagant palaces, modest churches, and brilliant cathedrals, and you'll see the transformation civilization had from classic stories to spectacle in Europe's buildings. Compare the clothes of armored clad Charles Martel, and the dress-wearing Louis XIV, and you'll see the transformation from heroic protagonist to self-important Antagonist Kings. They took credit for the accomplishments of civilization, as though they, themselves, were the player god responsible for it all.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/LavishIncomparableBumblebee' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

_Louis XIV (1643-1715) spent an estimated 50% of France's annual Gross National Product to build and maintain his Palace at Versailles, he didn't even pay taxes. He was a self-described god on earth. I love to think what Protagonist Kings would think if they time-travelled to see this opulance._

Most of society's money went to the leaders, and wasn't re-invested to help win the game of civilization. Main Street became increasingly unhappy as frontline problems piled up. Their houses were still thatched. They did manual labor all day. They still paid almost all the taxes but were banned from advancing in official society. Feudalism became a caste system controlled. The leaders fought against distributing the benefits of an advancing civilization to the people doing the work on the frontline. We thus rightfully call Antagonist Kings; Darth King. The nobles lost the plot of their own stories. They turned their people from player gods into extras. It sent Darth King's civilizations into revolutions, and cost him his head.

## Repeat Story

I'm not sure if you know this Stargazer, but the Devil was once an angel. The angel Lucifer was his name. He lived with God up in the clouds with the rest of the heavenly beings. All these angels communicated God's will to His people below; teaching them the virtue, morality, and ethics they'd need to become protagonists and player gods.

But Lucifer rejected God's teachings. He grew vain, greedy, and deceptive. Soon he even challenged God's supremacy. In response, God threw Lucifer down from Heaven to be the Dark Lord of Hell.

Free from the restrictions of justice, fairness, and virtue, Lucifer grew his evil powers. Soon he was the Devil, who taught humanity the vanity, greed, hubris, selfishness they'd need to become antagonists and extras. But Lucifer kept his angelic form. The Devil can thus be anyone, at any time—that is why humanity is a mixture of angels and demons, both rest on our shoulders, always attracting us to either side.

The trick for humanity is to resist our demons and embrace our angels; not make "deals with the Devil" so to speak. That's how we can be player gods who do what's best for ourselves, and help society prosper.

Angels and demons is the Christian tale of good and evil. I'm sure many religions share a similar story. The story of Lucifer echoes throughout literature. Harry Potter's Lord Voldermort, The Lord of the Rings Lord Sauron, and Star War's Lord Vader were all once heroes. Each grew evil because they were unwilling to give up their power. They were corrupted by ambitions of lifelong supremacy. It's probably so prevalent in our religions and literature because it's so common in humanity; power often corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.

Darth King actually thought he was an angel. During the Age of Enlightenment, philosophers like Voltaire, Hume, and Rousseau were writing about improving humanity with ideals of freedom and compassion. The nobility read these ideals and liked them. After all, these leaders believed they were protectors of their flock. Absolute monarchs with the power of life and death over their subjects, such as Frederick I, Emperor Joseph II, and Catherine II, called themselves "enlighten monarchs." Their mentality was, "Everything for the people, nothing by the people."

We can see how self-serving this mentality is. Why couldn't the nobles pay taxes? Why couldn't the people have a fair judicial system? Enlightened monarchs preached one thing, and did another. The point is Darth King wasn't evil for being born into nobility. He is evil for holding his people back. He wanted them to be extras watching the story of civilization, and not player gods playing the game of civilization. The nobles thus became fallen heroes. And sadly, this story of fallen kings is repeating itself in our modern times as well. Our antagonists are also fallen heroes.

It's important to note, while Rousseau's followers in so many revolutions may have been political free, they were economically desperate. Hunger, disease, unemployment, illiteracy were all rampant. Rousseau's time was basically one of "economic anarchy." This is when red/blue philosophies were born. They wanted political liberation from kings but were also obessed with economic growth to bring the people up from poverty.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/MadeupTameLamb' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

_Here's a tidbit of an Industrial Revolution business magnate George Westinghouse. Among his inventions was the air brake, fridge, and electric generator. Westinghouse's massive company helped conquer economic anarchy._

Society loved the original kings for winning the "King's Peace". Likewise, the initial economic kings were heroes of the era of mass-production who won the "Executive's Prosperity." These heroes said follow me, recognize my property rights, work (hard as hell) for my company and we'll all be better off. The people did. Society got new tools like lightbulbs, stoves, and telephones.

The original leaders of the Industrial Age told a good story, and thus the people were again player gods. Protagonists like Andrew Carnegie, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Louis B. Mayer are basically the economical versions of original warrior kings like Clovis I, Charles Martel, and Charlemagne.

But, once the Industrial Age was over, Protagonist Executives, become antagonist Darth Blockbusters. Another story of a fallen angel. You can see it today in Hollywood. Someone told their elite as much:

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/WarmNippyCockatiel' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

That should both worry you and make you happy Stargazer. First the worrying part; Darth Blockbuster defends the Industrial Age because it makes him powerful. He surrounds himself with a story of self-importance and distracts the people with the dark majic of spectacle.

Since, entering the Internet Age, dark majic has skyrocketed in our society. The once humble American Dream to own a home and make a honest living, became a lifestyle of spectacle. Small homes became McMansions with luxury baths and kitches. Cars got way bigger, with more chrome, more horsepower. Televisions increased in size to ludicrious proportions. Food got supersized. Sugar was added to everything we eat. Movies became franchise stories that were retold over and over. Instead of using digital technology to improve life on Earth, technology was used to make a matrix of dark majic that survived by increasing diabetes, laziness, and greed. All because Darth Oil, Telephone, Suburbs, Sugar needed to distract the people from making a new player god to upgrade and enjoy the freedom, self-sufficiency, and collaboration of the Internet Age.

The good news is, where not at a "let's burn down society" point yet. We can transition to the Internet Age ourselves before the frontline gets so bad and so ununhappy we start a bloody revolution. We can usher in the era of mass-collaboration ourselves. And that's a strength and a weakness—because we're the ones who have to stand-up.

# ACT THREE

## Evolution Yea or Nea

Act three is the nail bitter. The time when a good writer rewards the audience with the final duel, and the answer of who will win: Noble Jedi's or Evil Sith, the Ministry of Magic or the Thugs of Voldemort, Open-source Heroes or Darth Blockbuster Antagonists.

You are the deciding factor Stargazer. Act three in 2020, is a simple question; do you believe in Techvolution? Do you think Right/Left philosophy is outdated? Do you see why the era of mass-production must be replaced by the era of mass-collaboration? Do you want to hold levers of power in your society instead of complaining, protesting, and begging. Do you think our rules, regulations, codes, and laws should be easy to access, use, and understand. When you look at the 1969 way of life—gas cars, fast-food, 9-5 workdays, McMansions—do you see dark majic design to keeps us in the Industrial Age forever?

This final battle has an even simpler question. Do you appreciate your importance to life on Earth? Do you realize you must have the right, and duty, to solve your problems with modern tools. If you don't, we're stuck using adaptions as out of place as camels trying to swim in the Amazon. Driving to work in Boston blizzards, forcing non-English speakers to call into a call-centre, depending on doctor writing to record our medical histories. All that's anti-evolution.

Society has no magic button. No divine player who'll evolve for us. You are on the frontline. You are the one in the game that's supposed to do the hard work and update society bit by bit to the new age with the majic of new tools.

I think you do understand all this. So, act three comes down to one simple question. Do you want to be a player god? That's a choice you have to make. It's a choice as big as any you're ever going to make. Because if we don't upgrade now, it only means your kids and your grandkids will live even unhappier lives as the burden of transforming society falls on their shoulders.

Here are two stories to help you decide. One to make you realize how powerful Main Street will be in the Internet Age, versus the soul-crushing regret we'll have if we keep running our society on old ideological fumes. But if want to be an extra. Here's your, and your kids, future.

## Option 1 - Extra

Remember the Thirty Years War, when Main Street was inside the Science Age, but tearing itself apart in the name of Protestant and Catholic kings using the Divine Rights of Nobles from the Medieval Age; adding to that anarchy was King Charles. His nasty, brutish, and short story is what extras think they want sit back and enjoy. So let's watch it.

Charles ruled England as a proud protestant king. His father King James taught him from birth the "Nobles Right to Rule" was a matter of responsibility and faith, not self-interest. In fact it was King James who commissioned the "King James Version" Holy Bible that's still used today. James had it written because he wanted regular people to—among other lessons—understand why kings are their natural leaders.

Remember this was before Rousseau. There was no alternatives. Although, England had many versions of Christianity, all believed in a kings right to rule. However, England did also have an elected Parliament. But in Charle's eyes it was only supposed to advise the king. It did advice much, even if most advice was ignored. However, much to Charles' chagrin, Parliament held a big lever of power. After some revolts in the Middle Ages, the elected representatives had the power to approve, or reject, new taxes.

Like most kings, Charles and his father spent lavishly; jewelery, palaces, banquets and balls never come cheap. With the Thirty Years War raging, it wasn't long before England went broke and Charles needed more money. Parliament, filling up with idealistic Christians (especially Purtitans, the people who fled to America and started Thanksgiving) wouldn't say yes until they got more political powers. In turn, Charles refused to talk to them. In fact, the king sent parliament home and ruled by himself for over 10 years. The king got his money by using the ancient feudal rulebook. One example, he fined men who didn't come to his royal coronation.

And here is the moment we all should fear. Government was broke. The struggle between king and parliament was very simple; who should pick up the bill?. England was rather wealthy; both sides could pay the debt by sacrificing for the good of the country. But both sides thought it was the others responsibility. Sadly for Charles, the people were no longer desperate. After all, they were in the middle of the Science Age, and thus enjoying all the benefits of better calenders, record keeping, navigation equipment, and gunpowder. It was precisely because the English people were empowered by new levers of power, that they could stand up to the king.

But without Rousseau's new philosophy to explain themselves, the people were left asking for change from a king who thought he was a god. Parliament eventually got sick of being ignored while paying the governments bills. So they raised an army, Charles did the same, and the two sides fought the English Civil War (1642–1646). The Parliamentary Army was local Protestants devoted to democracy—on their way to becoming player gods—who chose their own leaders by merit, and suspected Charles was a closet Catholic. Charles's Royalist Army were mostly nobles who hired foreign mercenaries, and suspected the Parliamentarians had gone mad.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Cx2kkgO5_Y
_Before Rousseau's new philosophy, the people had a hard time justifying being player gods._

After four years of grusome battles and bloodshed, Charles lost. He was held under arrest, while rules for a less powerful "constitutional monarchy" were being made by the Parliamentarians. Charles then escaped, hired a new army, and fought the Second English Civil War (1648–1649). Charles lost again. The Parliamentarians were now enraged.

They forgot about making a constitutional monarchy, and instead charged Charles for crimes against the English people. These newly minted player gods wanted all the levers of power. Charles didn't budge. The ruling philosophy said he was king. The Bible—his father's Bible!, the ultimate rulebook!—said so in plain English. So, Charles refused to speak to the court; a father doesn't answer to his children.

Soon, Darth King Charles stood at the foot of his own chopping block. And what happened next tells us why being an extra today is a really bad idea.

## Charles Speaks His Antagonism- The Proof is in the Words

Public speaking is hard for most everyone; for Charles it was near impossible. Charles had a speech impediment. Often called a stammer or stutter. No one then, or even now, understands what causes it. For a stutterer, talking is like playing guitar with music notes written on the spot by a gremlin. Some words are easy to say, some are ~~difficult~~ hard, and some decide which at the last mili-mili-mili-second.

But a stutter isn't just about pauses, repetitions, or missing words. Stuttering is like having a mini-seizure. Your body flexes. Your neck tenses. You stop breathing. It's horrible. I should know because I suffer from the same affliction as Charles did.

The physical pain isn't even the worst. Getting _that_ look from people is. The "what the fuck is wrong with you?" look.

_"Hello, my ~~name~~ I'm Charles. I wa-want can want to ~~help~~ discuss, the situation with the, ~~Parliament~~ House of Parliament or the-the-the-the people inside, theeee Commons..."_

Actually, the worst part is knowing you'll never talk to anyone about your problem. That's why stuttering forces a person to be quiet, shy, passive, and eager to please. It's very frustrating because one doesn't stutter when alone, swearing, yelling, singing, talking to a dog (Charles had two), or sometimes when speaking through a "character".

But for some damn reason, in everyday conversation, the gremlin forces erratic speaking, random silence, binge drinking, and watching life pass you by. It's entirely possible Charles' relationship with Parliament was so bad because he simply didn't want to face the gremlin. I mean, should a king have one?

My speech impediment was why I got a job in a car insurance claim department. After a vice-president at an old company secretly told my supervisor I wasn't allowed to talk to customers—for fear of embarrassing the company—I was like shit, I guess I don't have this damn gremlin under control. Of course I was hurt, but I never told anyone I had the impediment, so, despite very helpful therapy as a kid, it was obviously still a problem.

So, fuck it. I decided to jump in the ocean and sink or swim in the scary waters of a call-center. Where a virtual horror show of gremlins were waiting aroung every corner. It was a daily workout of all-day phone calls, angry drivers, customer service expectations, no "outs" like swear words, drinking games, or wonky behavior to hide behind. I stayed with it like that desert fox learning to swim, motivating myself by saying, "I'm getting better!."

And it was far worse than I thought possible. The insurance company wanted adjusters to answer ever more phone calls. To incentive us, they'd ring a monotone "bell" because… I don't know.  They never said why (probably because they're devoted to the Industrial Age) we employees learned questioning "the bell" was a bad idea. Management used it as punishment; "answer more phone calls or we'll make the bell faster and louder!"

I'm being serious by the way. We were often more stressed then the person who just had a car crash. Whatever the reason, DING-DING-DING-DING-DING-DING-DING-DING almost all day—which gave people who weren't stutterers tremendous anxiety, breakdowns, and stress leaves.

Super-shock speech therapy! After about a year, I didn't have to massage my jaws at night to release it from all the teeth shattering jaw-clenches I did to divert vocal stuttering. I killed that fucking gremlin! And that's what it took for me to greatly improve my fluency. Like an ocean fox, I walked around a new, happier, person.

Yet, Charles never had this lesson. In fact, he didn't have any lessons. No speech therapy to learn "turtle talk". No field trips to practice ordering pizza with professional guideance. No fourth grade teacher to give him winks to remember to breath. His gremlin didn't even have a name like "speech impediment". Like everyone back in the day when doctors prescribed blood-sucking leeches as medicine, Charles was all alone trying to make sense of Nature's gremlins of diseases, infections, viruses, and speech impediments.

Charles adapted as anyone would. He was famously shy, quiet, and antisocial his whole life. Even when fighting for 16 years defending his ruling philosophy, Charles still probably had to massage his strained jaws every night. He was all alone.

And now, Charles, God's King, was accused of being "a Tyrant, A Traitor, Murderer, and a public enemy to the Commonwealth of England." This was a watershed moment in modern human history. For the first time the people weren't replacing one king for another. They were killing the king, and replacing him with themselves. The people would control all the levers of people and be their own player god!

This was a total shock to Charles. It would be like us watching the laws of physics being broken. It simply makes no sense that a king, isn't the king. There was no rule to reference, no justification to use. The ruling philosophy is the Matrix, and the Matrix is supposed to keep everyone in line. But all of a sudden some people were waking up, and calling the Matrix a lie. A noble lie perhaps, but still a lie.

Charles couldn't make any sense of it. He was devoted to his father, his faith, and his conscience. Being a king was his responsibility, and he thus must defend his country and its holy rulebook. So at his trial Charles only asked by what rule was he being tried? When the judges said "the people" and convicted Charles anyway, the king was astounded. His next chance to talk sense into these misguided mademen would be at his own chopping block.

![Whitehall](/img\diagrams\techvolution-whitehall-charles.jpg)
_This is Whitehall. A palace built by Henry VIII. Charles walked through here to a scaffold and his chopping block. On the ceiling is a painting commissioned by his father which shows James being taken to heaven by angels. Charles was raised his entire life to be a divine king. Could you see outside the divine rights of nobles if you were him?_

## Charles Speaks

Fuck the ringing bell of a claims department, imagine the stress of a stutterer minutes from execution, having to say something to defend his throne, his family's place in history, and his kingdom. I can't explain how anxious he would have been. I know he feared the emotional pain of silence, more than getting his head chopped off.

 ![Charles Speaks](/img\diagrams\techvolution-charles-speaks.jpg)

Now Charles had to stand before these misguided, sinning, want-to-be player gods. He had one last chance to say something. And he said this:

> Truly I desire their (the people's) liberty and freedom as much as anybody whomsoever; but I must tell you their liberty and freedom consist in having of government, those laws by which their life and their goods may be most their own. It is not for having a share in government, Sir, that is nothing pertaining to them. A subject and a ruler are clear different things... therefore I tell you that I am the Martyr of the people. I die a Christian according to the profession of the Church of England, as I found it left me by my father... I have a good Cause and I have a gracious God...I go from a corruptable to an incorruptable crown where no disturbance can be, no disturbance in the world.

Charles spoke his word so eloquently everyone was impressed. He was rarely so clear and passionate. Charles' would have died happy, knowing the angels around his shoulders, killed his gremlin before lifting him up to Heaven. I must say I'm happy for him—it is heavenly to say what's on your mind.

In truth, there were no angles, and no gremlins. Stuttering is an anxiety disorder. So what really happened is amazing. What should have been extremely stressful; the crowds, the soldiers, his lost royalty, and his chopping block; were Charles' freedom. He was 100 percent positive nobles had the divine right to rule. Everyone else had gone mad, and why should anyone be anxious around madmen who've already committed to murdering you? Why be anxious around people who'll never get it? Without any interaction possible, Charles was basically talking to himself, or to one of his dogs.

We do our best to understand history with songs, books, and images. But we can't time travel. Nor can go into Julius Caesar's or Cleopatra's minds and fully understand their motives. But, by luck or good fortune, I can go into Charles' mind at this historic moment. And one of history's most evil Antagoinst Kings, was a completely moral man. He had no hate in his heart. In fact, it was his morality that killed the gremlin. It's the only way he could have spoken a word on that scaffold.

Charles was a victim. A regular person told he was king. When asked to throw that away, it was like being asked to wake up from the Matrix with no experience with frontline pain to prompt the awakening. Could you do any better?

Only a few leaders ever have. Often called "philosopher kings" they have the wisdom and kindness to emphasize with frontline pain. Like good army generals, they use their power to help win the war on the frontline, instead of living in palaces and holding many banquets and balls.

But philosopher kings are very rare. In times of general peace, most everyone in a heirarchy get detached from the game of civilization. This happened to Charles. He never felt frontline pain, not even in the battles he caused; and that's the point. It's not the job of detached leaders to decide when to upgrade civlization. Why would they want to?

The truth then, now, and forever is that evolution happens on the frontline. Leaders aren't there. You are.

## Option 2 - Player God

Main Street can choose to become player gods because of Internet Age protagonists. Paul Baran is one of the big ones; a true Jedi. This one guy took it upon himself to prevent a nuclear holocaust (talk about stepping up). When the Soviets tested a hydrogen bomb in 1955, Baran realized only an updated, robust, and reliable communications network would ease American and Soviet trigger fingers during tense stand offs.

Baran worked all alone for years. By 1960 he came up with his new network's two core ideas; fully distributed data networks, and packet communication. The first eliminated central hubs and hierarchy, the second made sure no information would be lost during transmission. With many pages of technical specifications on hand he went to give his work away. Sadly, the Defense Department surrounded him with red-tape, and AT&T, with a monopoly over America's telephone network, repeatedly said his ideas were impossible. These antagonists shut Baran down until years later the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) saw the brilliance and built Baran's distributed communications network.

By late 1969, as the world was watching Woodstock, Vietnam, and the Moon landing, ARPAnet, the first version of the internet, went online. Reliable communication with no central hubs was born. For the first time in history individuals could communicate with no middlemen to control their information or message. Few people in the last days of the Industrial Age understood how their world, way of life, and philosophy, had been replaced. The Internet Age was here.

Think of that when you browse the web. The internet was created to survive a nuclear holocaust. Realize how powerful it must be, and therefore realize how powerful you are. The internet is your New World. A place of eternal equality because no one can control you. No professor, executive, president, or king can shut you down. BitTorrents, Netflix, and Wikipedia all beat Darth Blockbuster, They will keep winning in the war to establish the Internet Age.

Now think of the rest of your technology. Those high-flying drones, sensor filled smartwatches, 20 megapixel cameras, and super-computer gaming systems. These tools are your Internet Age cyborgology. If you had those at Woodstock in 1969, not even those drugged-up hippies would believe your mutant powers. You are a unique lifeform on Earth. For all we know, you're the most advanced lifeform ever to exist.

As Gordon Moore said in 1973 "We are really the revolutionaries in the world today—not the kids with long hair and beards who were wrecking the schools a few years ago." In fact, it's Moore's Law that shows us how much better our cyborgologies will keep getting. He predicted that every 12-18 months the power of computers would double. And he was right. That's why our digital technology and internet speed is over three million times faster now, then in 1969.

Gordon Moore was part of the "Traitorous Eight" a group of young inventors who founded Silicon Valley. They each had a pivotal hand in creating technology like the integrated circuit, microprocessor, and personal computer. Intel, AMD, Amelco, Eugene Kleiner Perkins, and dozens of other historic companies were started by their hands. More than that, they bucked the rigid corporate heiracrchies of the day, and treated every employee as a member. They started companies based on collaboration.

And they broke the rules to do it all. In the late 50's, the era of mass-production was still in full swing. Everyone was a line worker—a cog in the wheel of machinery. The company told you what to wear, who to socialize with, even what furntiure your office was allowed to have. The company owned it's employees, and wrote itself the rulebook to prove it.

These eight guys said to heck with all that. The game of civilization rewards invention and risk, not conformity and business-as-usual. They left to start their own companies. And so changed the world.

SILICON VALLERY VIDEO
_This is edited down from American Experience: Silicon Valley._

Traitors. Troublemakers. Shameful act. Equality over heirarchy. Invention over the tried and true: look at your home assisstant, smartphone, or laptop, these morals invented your cyborgology. Don't take it for granted. Other cultures were investing billions into research and development back in 1969, and are now totally forgotten. The Traitorous Eight and their followers are heroes, because they went beyond inventing technology. They merged new technology with a new philosophy to create the Internet Age.

Now it's your turn. We first toy around with new technology. Checking news feeds, flying drones, taking endless photos, playing computer games are acts of non-playing characters learning the tools of player gods. But to become a player god, we must use our tools as levers of power. Only then will we finish what the Traiterous Eight started, and upgrade our society to the Internet Age.

All it takes is the click of a new set of ideals of right and wrong, good and bad, in science, art, morals, politics, and economics. Only a new ruling philosophy will unite us to see the big picture; that all our choices matter, because we're all the player god, and only we can win our game of civilization.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/SlimGleefulDuiker' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

_That's you getting stronger with each game improvement. It means you have better education, cancer research, crime fighting, electricity generation, product design and manufacturing, and so much more. The point is, we've technically evolved so fast, we've far outpaced our politics. We need to click a new philosophy, to start living happier lives in our real-life game of civilization._

We have all this amazing power at our finger tips and we're letting political pundits tell us if climate change is real? We're stuck in two hours of traffic everyday? We're letting Darth Blockbuster tell us to... what? Follow his rules that make him king?

Look at the video above; we can change our own world!

Global warming, human migrations, widespread obesity, antisocial behavior, soaring national and personal debt, high divorce rates, traffic filled roads, rising insurance rates, hopeless kids shooting up their schools. Our list of problems keeps growing, because the people aren't using the stupendous power of modern technology, to evolve our civilization.

If you chicken-out from playing the game of civilization, then you've chosen to be an non-playing character extra watching your civilization as if it was a story in a movie theatre. You've chosen an unhappy life because you think someone else will solve our problems. There's nothing moral about that decision, because a ruling philosophy worth following is one that facilitates evolution; and Right/Left philosophies, and the era of mass-production, no longer do that.

Techvolution does, if you believe in yourself.

## Extras Die Off

While Charles was fighting his wars, Europe was fighting the Thirty Years War. A time when Main Street kept fighting and murdering each other for generations; all in the name of a Catholic of Protestant king. Sadly, when the Purtitan Democracy ended in 1658, Charles son Charles II was put on the throne. Without Rousseau's new ruling philosophy, no one had any better ideas. It wasn't long before the new king took his revenge—most everyone who signed his fathers' death warrant was punished; nine were drawn, quartered, and beheaded.

And that's the point giving you two options. Even though the English commoners were victorious in the two civil wars, without a new philosophy, the antagonists still ended up winning. And remember the English Civil War started over a simple question, "who should pay for the government's massive debt?"

It's when the money runs out that ruling philosophies change. Only then do the people get so unhappy, they see through the dark majic, and demand an upgrade. The divine rights of nobility of Royalist Europe, Marxist-Leninism of the Soviet Union, all went down when the money ran out.

And we're having that same fight now. No Conservative or Progressive ideologue is going to sacrifice their ideological platform, projects, and politics to pay for our 1969 lifestyle that keeps racking up IOUs to stay alive.

So, if you stay an extra of the Industrial Age, that's your fate. You'll limit your politics to only see Progressivsm or Conservatism. You'll slowly become radicalized, and end up chasing phantoms in the news, rallies, and demonstrations. You'll argue with antagonists at work but get no where. You'll get so frustrated you'll march and scream for change. Eventually, after another financial crisis, debt crisis, migrant crisis, pandemic, disputed election, constituional amendment; some crisis or another, the West will reach the end of kicking the can down the road, and live through a new version of the Thirty Years War or English Civil War. That's not supposed to sound alarmist. It's a diagnosis using our history.

And regardless of "wanting to stay out of it" extras will be forced to stop watching their civilization, and join in, as our society tears itself apart.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEczkhfLwqM
_"A warning of the dangers of entrusting power to those who feel summoned by God to war, or feel that their sense of justice and order is the only one valid." How much longer do you think before Red/Left politics completely breaks down? Look at their devoted followers raging at each other, do you want to let them decide your fate?_

And in the end, Left and Right will quite literally kill each other off. Because we're in the Internet Age, and every new age, eventually gets a new ruling philosophy. We can skip all the bullshit of Left/Right hatred, and upgrade right now, because we can learn from our ancestors on Main Street who used Rousseau to demand their happiness. Which they got when they clicked a new philosophy and reached for the levers of power as player gods.

## Look Up

Look up. Whereever you are, look up. Do you see the "mythical player god"? No you don't, and you never will. You are that player; you're choices determine what happens in the game. If you eat a salad over a cheesesteak, that means health statistics get better. If you install solar panels, you improve our antifragility against disasters. If you read instead of binge watch, society gets more educated.

You are the lifeform playing the game of civilization. And doing the typical thing of suburban house, soccer practice, 9-5 commute, 401k, saving up for college, television every night, is losing us the game. Your soul already feels it—it's why we're so unhappy because we know we aren't living up to the potential of the Internet Age. To win again, everyone has to adapt in the exact same way a polar bear would have to adapt in the Amazon. Find friends who believe in the same purpose, and form a new community who takes evolution one step at a time.

That's what Techvolution is. The self-awareness that we are all the mythical player god. It's therefore our right, and duty, to do whatever we must to win the game. You don't have to change the entire world. You only have to do what you can to improve your slice of it. And the compass that shows you the way, is your own happiness. Not the pretend happiness that has to brag to about getting more stuff. The happiness inside your soul that smiles when it majically contributes to evolving life on Earth. Evolution is not race, but a never ending game.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/GrandioseTinyApisdorsatalaboriosa' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
_Please enable the sound._

The question is, did Techvolution click?

I know one thing. Thanks to to Internet Age protagonists, you can't go back to snail mail, telephones, or Blockbuster. You're a modern day cyborg committed to using the tools of the Internet Age. These super powerful tools are everywhere. Levers of power waiting for you to grab.

It's up to you to take hold. Darth Blockbuster will never, ever, ever, "see the light" and play the game for you. That's why I'm not writing to "The Executive." I'm writing to you Stargazer. You're the player god!

![Illustration](/img\sketches\playergod-stargazer.jpg)

The fate of civilization is fully on your shoulders. Your job is to do what's best for yourself, and help society prosper. Looking up for guidance you see two options. Open-source Jedi who've never stopped struggling, innovating, and filling the world we majic. And the self-importance, short-sightedness of Darth Blockbuster—the fallen hero of the Industrial Age who uses the trickery of dark majic and a corrupted rulebook to keep himself in power.

Our game's fate then is rather simple. Who is your hero Stargazer?

## The End

I wanted to write beautiful Platonic dialogues for you here. I'd love to have Antagonists and Protagonists debating with Stargazer, who has an internal discussion between the benefits and drawbacks of being an extra or player god, and the joys of majic versus dark majic.

I'd also love to write "Black Mirror" stories about cyborgologists, techvolutionaries, majicians (whatever you call them), rejecting the easy money of Industrial Age society, and fighting to bring people out of the Matrix and into the Internet Age.

Imagine these guys as overclocked Linus Tech Tips. In fact, today's "geeks" are really majicians in waiting. Like revolutionaries of old, these are the people who know how powerful modern computers are. Darth Blockbuster's excuses mean nothing to them. Soon, they'll bring Main Street into the era of mass-collaboration; roofers will learn to use drones, cleaners IR cameras, craftsman 3D printers. Because of yesterday's geeks, the middle-class will like their jobs, raise their families, and give their kids a brighter future on a newly empowered Main Street.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/WhimsicalLeadingFirebelliedtoad' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p> <a href="https://gfycat.com/whimsicalleadingfirebelliedtoad">via Gfycat</a></p>

_An idealized view of mass-collaboration. Although we'll lose the suburban lifestyle once there's no antagonists or extras, and just protagonists and player gods._

I want to write all this stuff, but I can't keep thinking for you. Nor do I want to keep holding your hand. This book has been informative enough. At the start I asked "are you happy?" Now you have to ask yourself "Am I going to do something about it?"

Our unhappiness is a fire alarm. Look around, and see old drafty windows, gas engine cars, call-centres, cable news, fake drama television, mass-producted toys, eight different bosses, another corporate meeting, idiotic rush hour traffic, endless suburban houses, boiling temperatures, hungry polar bears, leaky faucets, consultant huddles, hopeless kids... Do you see unnecessary problems? Do you want to solve them with Internet Age levers of power?

Or, do you want to return to the comfort and safety of being a Industrial Age extra, bragging about gas cars, fake job titles, and McMansions, while following the antagonists rules, and chasing the phantoms of Left/Right politics.

Do you see that era of mass-production must be replaced by mass-collaboration. And that Left/Right politics has to be upgraded with your right and duty to solve your own problems using apps, computers and the internet.

The fate of your life, your kids, and of your society, rests on the simple question—will you step up and become a player god in the game of civlization?

If you do, we win. If you don't, we lose.

# EPILOGUE

## Welcome

Hello Stargazer! I'm glad you came aboard. If it wasn't for you, the future would exist only in science fiction. Now because of you, we can start Techvolution. While I dearly hope Left/Right politics gets better, I don't think we should wait and see—it's much safer to make the future happen now.

There's lots of work ahead. But we've done it many times before, the Minutemen, Abolitionist, Civil Rights, Environmental movements have all changed the world. While I, unfortunately, can't tell you what your journey will be like. You can be your own celebrity. I'm sure you'll soon love to tag #installsolarpanels, #forgetrushhour, #newsmallbusiness, #smallhomeliving.

And if you like, you can follow my trek to make our society better. I'll be your guide.

## My Frontline Problem

Watch this clip from Netflix's _Black Mirror_. It's a story of a crazed man who wants to talk with the CEO of an Instagram-like app called Smithereen. He holds a company intern hostage awaiting the CEO’s call. Police surround him, corporate lackies try to deflect him, bullets are fired at him, but he still wants his phone call. The only thing people know is he was hit by a drunk driver years before.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gF1oGQ2hAA&feature=youtu.be&t=57

New technology is either our salvation. Or our distraction. This is frontline pain. It's not caused, or solved, by Progressives, or Conservatives. It's neither someone else problem, or bad luck. This is the pain of regular life on Main Street. Pain is what evolution uses to force lifeforms to adapt, and if we refuse, life finds someone else to carry it's banner.

These are the poor souls car insurance adjusters speak to. While most aren't so devastated; far too many are (in fact many adjusters don't use social media because of threats from callers, sadly a kidnapping isn't too outlandish. Some callers send thank-you presents though, so there's good and bad). Deadly crashes, hijackings, abductions, drive-by shootings, drunk driving, car fires, running red lights, and yes, distracted driving—every human tragedy eventually calls an insurance adjuster. And all the while DING-DING-DING-DING-DING-DING.

I wept while watching Smithereens; full out tears. I knew what the plot twist was—that distracted driving killed a loved one—because I'd spoken with this person too many times. This was the motivation for me to make my app. I wanted to help solve horrible, useless, and preventable car crashes with something (I now call) the Life Star.

Here's why I failed; and here's why I'll succeed.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(57.50% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/GrandUnknownHagfish' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p> <a href="https://gfycat.com/grandunknownhagfish">via Gfycat</a></p>
_This is the what digital technology is good for. Only player gods will reach for it._

## My App

My app was very simple. Using modern web development, it took just a few months of work. Take some free code from GitHub, an inexpensive cloud computing account, and the design skills of a novice. It was so simple, it might not even get me a job in "tech."

Here’s how it worked. Today's insurance industry is entirely based in the Industrial Age. So after an accident, drivers are expected to exchange information. Because they're (understandably) frazzled they often don’t. Adjusters have to search for each other—literally calling around or hoping someone calls you. Delays pile up like crazy; causing most of the maddening DING-DING-DING-DING-DING.

Like Uber uses online maps, my app let adjusters post an accident on a google map. Since every accident shares GPS coordinates, all adjusters, regardless of what drivers do, can find and email each other. It’s minimal cost was paid for by rental car companies and repair shops who loved the ability to communicate with adjusters online instead of waiting on hold.

That's how simple it is to foster mass-collaboration and save hundreds of millions of dollars and millions of hours of productivity. That's how much the Internet Age is already here, but the Matrix of the Industrial Age dark majic keeps it from people's eyes. To wake workers up, all I had to do was show my app's majic and they instantly smiled.

The best part was something much better. With digital collaboration we can start getting better information on our economy than GDP growth estimates. For example, with my small little app, for the first time, we’d have a database of the exact location and causes of car crashes. Thereafter we could cross reference with weather, traffic, demographics, and many other databases. We’d finally learn why car crashes happen, and start to fight back.

A database of crash locations and causes doesn’t exist today. Government regulators don't care about it. Insurance company managers don't care about it. Extras tell themselves "they" are solving their problems. So, when tires are faulty, intersections jam up too much, pot holes get too big, or anything else repeatedly causes crashes, we don’t even know.

My little app was a happy upgrade in the game of civilization; but not good enough. Or more likely, too good. My biggest problem was I messed with a lever of power. Now because of Techvolution, I can depend on player gods to help me fight back.

![New Tool Creation](/img\diagrams\techvolution-civilization-is-here.jpg)
_Look familiar? Uber, Airbnb, and my app, all use GPS maps. Kind of looks like the game of Anno1800 or Civilization doesn't it? Didn't I tell you computers games teach us how we'll live in the Internet Age. A sneak peek at the Life Star._

## Attacking a Lever of Power

Adjusters hold the insurance checkbook in their hand. They decide how much to payout on every claim. Making adjusters use telephones isn't an accident. It's a huge lever of power to say "call me when I'm available". By easing congestion, and taking away the DINGS, I was in effect taking away the insurance company's ability to create friction for anyone withdrawing money. And, lessening crashes wasn't much of a selling point either.

This was never officially said to me. Remember being far from the frontline makes people not realize the consequences of their actions. In fact, most insurance decision-makers today have never even spoken with a customer; nevermind processed a claim. They'd watch Smithereens with no tearful recognition. Simply put, with no pain felt, there was no problem to solve.

Thus, now I know how to fix my failure. The key to success, for me and you Stargazer, is making a modern lever of power, then making frontline pain common knowledge so we turn extras into player gods who take control of their lives.

<a class="twitter-timeline" data-width="600" data-height="500" data-theme="light" href="https://twitter.com/OPP_GTATraffic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">Tweets by OPP_GTATraffic</a> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
_This is a Twitter feed for the Ontario Police. It tells everyone about crashes in real-tme. People on this list—right now—are living through Smithereens in some way. That pain used to only be felt by the unlucky few, but by making it common knowledge, we can all feel the pain and use mass-collaboration to solve it using the life saving rules of the Life Star._

## The Life Star

At it's heart, Smithereens is a story about an extra. The tortured man assumes the company Smithereen will care about his problem. Extras assume "they" have the people's best interest at heart. "They" in government bureaucracy. "They" in corporations. "They" someone else. The truth is, "they" only have your interest at heart if you're holding levers of power. Because only then does "they" the powerful, becomes "we" the player god.

And that's the subject for the next book. For all the antagonists blustering and excuses, once a regular person becomes a player god, the game is won. The only reason Smithereens happens, the only reason those damn DINGs are still ringing, is Main Street accepts what the antagonists give.

Consider this, for every dollar Main Street puts into car insurance, we only get back 50 cents in claims; the rest goes to taxes, marketing, and administration fees. Insurance is basically a bank account, so we're losing half our savings every year and still waiting on hold! The middle-class has to do far better if we're going to live happy lives again.

This book made you a player god in mind, the next will make you a player god in reality. You'll finally hold many levers of power in your hand, first and foremost for car crashes. No middleman. No phantom chasing. No dark majic. No Death Star. No Darth Call Centre. Just you in control of your destiny—exactly like a person playing _Civilization, Anno 1800, or Cities: Skylines_ who always has all the levers of power they need to win the game.

That's what the Life Star is—the technological re-creation of Evolution; a rulebook to enforce Techvolution. It lets everyone play, understand, and master the game of civilization with fair, accountable, and understandable rules that give everyone a chance to win. A rulebook that makes everybody happy. Philosophers call it the rational state earned through years of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. I also call it the state of nature because all lifeforms happily live inside a place where Darth Blockbuster isn't allowed to play. You'll soon hold my new app in your hand, and read all about you power to win the game of civilization in Techvolution: Building the Life Star.

# THE APPENDICES

## Other Stuff

Hello. Thanks for sticking around. The appendices is some stuff I couldn't fit into the narrative of the book, but I thought might be cool to know. Just aheads up, It'll be more abstract then usual.

## Bears Everywhere, Polar Bears Only In Some Places

I never wanted to write this book. Most of this book is based on combinining the lessons of evolutionary biology and political philosophy. I think they're the same field of study, so similar they suggest a supreme physical life field of some kind. I used my take on political societies earned by using Aristotle's Poetics to better understand Hegelian Dialectics. It's work I did years ago. There's a lot to it—a genuine work of science forthcoming in _How to See the Matrix_—but it's original thinking will need the objective data from the Life Star to prove.

Most people are extremely bad at understanding their political opinions. While it's kinda of easy to get people to question their ideas using for example the Socratic Method, they'll revert once released back into the community. Psychology, upbringing, temperment, education, life experience, and all that intermix to form our politics. The Life Star will help us decode this jumble. But there's one thing that is far stronger than our opinions that determines our actions in political community.

The game of civilization; another way of saying human evolution. Human life does what all lifeforms do and gathers resources, grows, and diversifies. And it's this last point that has proven to hard for me to explain.

There's no way around the game of civilization. Like evolution to lifeforms, we all are inside it. It's paint by numbers. Tracks on the road. We all live and die under it's demands. Playing a Civilization computer game is really the best way to understand it. In the game, every player starts off small, then gathers resources, invests them smartly, and grows. Playing the game teaches the importance of geography, technological upgrades, adopting modern philosophies, defeating everyone who opposes you, investing in research and development, avoiding building palaces to host jewellery laden banquets and balls.

But no computer game forces the player into diversification or "adaptive radiation." In every game a player tries to take over the world with his one civilization. Never does the player have to segment himself into different civilizations. But, in natura this life-cycle of seed, growth, then adaption and diversificationns happens to all lifeforms and thus all civilizations. Few people realize how human cyborgology is the same as biology.

Polar Bears are nearly identitical to Brown Bears. But they're polar for a good reason. If they didn't adapt to the cold, water, and food supply, they've never live in the Artic. Thus, life diversified them. Adaptation is why we can't send the suffering polar bears to the Amazon, or even Antartica. They are not adapted to the climate in one area, and the ecosystem in the other. Imagine penguins with a few antartic polar bears walking around. Happy feet indeed.

The point is this. We evolve just like any other lifeform. But we evolve with tools, and we evolve in ages. So we start off small, grow, and diversity in waves. Each new age, is like new lifeforms, new cyborgs, spreading across the world for the first time. Look at the European Powers below, who colonized the world a few generations ago during the Age of Discovery.

<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:44%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/eSItBDecz3oJy" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/maps-cartography-territories-eSItBDecz3oJy">via GIPHY</a></p>
_This same thing is happening to the world-wide economy. We just don't have the philosophy to understand why, so we fight back against forces of Nature and adaptation._

The European Powers spread advanced civilization far and wide. Brutally in some cases—has anyone invented a way to spread new civilization or new life easily? But that's the point. Evolution doesn't care about individuals. Evolution is the rulebook by which life seeks out new and better ways to prosper.

So life spreads far and wide with no consideration for the lifeforms already there. But once the victors are declared, life no longer needs to spread, but now diversify into many different ecosystems. Ecosystems is how life stays fit, ready to adapt to an dangerous world. Thus, when the Age of Discoverty ended, it started the Age of Revolutions. Revolutions was life making human ecosystems as the GIF shows above.

Life thus has a two step process. One age of growth, the other of diversification. And this explains sooooo much of our politics today. The Industrial Age was one of world-wide growth. The second step, Internet Age, is one of diversification. And we're in this diversification phase right now. But nobody knows it, because we still use the Right/Left, era of mass-production philosophy of the Industrial Age.

So Trump and Brexit were inevitable. Our society wants to diversity after the Industrial Age. This is part of the game of civilization we all play, but few see the entireity of. That's why the established powers of the Industrial Age were so suprised, and have so much hatred, for nativist politics in the West. Although nativist politics isn't the future. Like the English Civil War, they're using old philosophies to try and make fundamental change. Only Techvolution, conscious adaptation using modern tools, is the new philosophy for our new Internet Age.

I plan to write a textbook on Techvolution (How to See the Matrix), I'll love to now delve more into the game of civilization for you., and teach you how to decode the trends of history: what a civil war is, how to predict a revolution, and so forth. The game defines our lives in so many ways, because it determines the roles we play in our lives. The accident of birth to parents, geography, or time-period makes us antagonists, protagonists, extras and player gods. Few people understand their role, and a insight might help you choose Techvolution. But that'll come later. Hopefully.

## The End of One Game, and the Beginning of a New One

This section is my personal opinion, so take it for what it's worth to you.

The Western World is a made up term. Don't get me wrong, it's a good way to describe the shared culture of France, Britain, Holland, America, Austrialia and the other members of the political unit we call "The West". But if you look down at the globe, these landmasses wouldn't look united. The West is a human creation. There was no "Western Europe" in Roman times. The entire Mediterranean Sea and surrounding land was unified under the Roman Empire.

It wasn't until western Rome fell in 476, and North Africa was conquered in the 700s, that what we call Western Europe became isolated, and hence got its own identity. It was these once barbarian germanic tribes, newly converted to Christianity and loyal to the idea of Rome, who laid the seeds for Western Civilization. The first kings of Western Europe survived the Dark Ages. They slowly returned civilization in the Medieval Ages. By the time the Renaissance Age came, Western Europe was doing quite well. But it was in the Science Age and the Industrial Age that the West saw their power grow world wide.

If the world had ended in 1900, The West would have won the game of civilization. Western Europe didn't have a head start. They didn't have any sort of advantage. If it's geography, resources, genes, or whatever were the reason for the West's rise to power, why did Rome fall. Why did Western Europe suffer so greatly in the Dark Ages if they had advantages available to no one else?

Western Europe conqured the world, because it used modern technology better than any other civilization. That's because philosophy is a gift. It lets humanity invent and use new and better tools. Ancient Greece got it first, then it went to Rome, then to Middle East in the Islamic Golden Age, back to Italy in the Renaissance, where it spread to Western Civilization during the Science and Industrial Age, and thereafter to the world via European colonialization.

Updating, or "clicking", a new philosophy is pivotal when playing civilization games for a good reason. Our real-life societies have to keep upgrading. Because the game of civilization never ends. Famines, wars, prosperity, climate change; clicking new philosophies is the only way to keeping inventing new tools, harvesting more resources, and surviving the game. There are antagonists inside every society. That's no excuse to stop playing. The rest of society either defeats them, or their civilization is replaced by another player and the idle extras still lose; their biological DNA (what genes we pass on) and cyborlogical DNA (what tools we pass on) is out of the gene pool either way.

Playing Civilzation, Anno 1800, or any other game is a better education than the best schooling today. These games mimick real-life, and thus integrate so many lessons. They force players to think of the big picture that's so hard to appreciate in real-life. It's an invaluable perspective, especially to our society which is so obessed with itself, inside our spectacle, and art stories.

Our culture is very entrenched in the Industrial Age. So many people live to take credit for titles, instead of accomplisments. Professors, managers, executives, union leaders, all cherish the title of Industrial Age heirarchies. These well-intentioned people don't want to return back to equality that happens at the start of every new age. They refuse to upgrade our philosophy. Or they want someone else to do the hard work. The result is, the West is in the process of losing the game.

We are in an entirely new age. The Internet Age is just as historical and powerful as the Science Age. And nobody has earned victory over it yet. Africa, South America, East Asia, Middle East, India, Eastern Europe, any civilization in the world is no better off then the West. Actually, I'd say, the West is far behind in the race to win the era of mass-collaboration.

In all my schooling, reading, discussing, working, in all my life, the ancestors of the barbarian kings, the ones whose grand parents worked 365 days a year in horrible English factories, who suffered famines in Ireland, draughts in France, and wars throughout Europe, the ones who worked the labs in New York, who worked the mines of Pennsylvania, the lines of Michigan, who solved millions of different problems during the Science and Industrial Ages as player gods; their grandkids today simple don't want to feel frontline pain. And without pain, they fell no reason to change update to the Internet Age. As one sharp observer noted to me "it's like they've folded their cards."

It's why so many of todays Western protagonists and player gods are foreigners. Also why so many tortured souls are born with irrationality (conspiracy theories and mental illness) in western society. Society is using their curse, to be irrational against the corrupt rulebook, and start (involuntarily) discovering the just rulebook of the next age. Irrational people are the most likely to see through the Matrix and start the rebellion. Their curse is to live the rebellion of the mind all the time. The laziness of their society, dooms them to miser. It's like these poor minds been clicked to find a new path for the rest of people to follow. That's the rationality of irrationality. The longer we hold off upgrading, the most cursed minds our society is forced to make.

Fighting to delay the upgrade, is also why so many antagonists import extras (illegal immigration, migrant crisis, legal immigration) into the West, because they know desperate people are inherent extras, and only a society of extras, keeps antagonists of the Internet Age in power in the 21st Century. With so many non-members, the West will likely not be able to form a new Internet Age player god. Said differently, the West can't form a community again, because most everyone inside either thinks they individually are self-sufficient and can spend their days watching sports on TV, walking their dog, and having a few casual friends. Or people in the West have a hyphenated identity of Blank-American. A player god is a community, the era of mass-collaboration needs a community of members, and the West has little of community left.

_This the Antagonist Executive at work. No jokes, too many know how real this is. Darth Blockbuster's delusion of being the leader, despite personal incompetence, lasts until player gods rise up. I feel like I'm watching Charles trying to make battle plans. I can't help but see "the decline and fall" in this sketch._

Modern technology is so powerful, it overcomes any natural drawback like language, geography, or history some places in the world have. That means the winner of the Internet Age is up for grabs. I don't know who will win. I do suspect though, the people of the West are dead-set on celebrating away their ancestors glory, quite literally living off their inheritance, and happily going down with the ship that was Western Civilization. With so much to gain from complacency, evolution is an unreasonable risk; especially when there's often no pain felt. I can't help but see "the decline and fall". Not of a state or government, but the civilization itself.

One thing I do know, that whichever society throws away the memories, excuses, and philosphies of the past, and embraces Techvolution and the era of mass-collaboration, will be the winner of the Internet Age. It's their player god who will happily reign supreme for many years in the never ending game of civilization. I smile, thinking of all those bakers, tailors, designers, roofers, engineers, cleaners, repairmen, and maybe even a few majicians, smiling on a new and empowered Main Street.

Hopefully they'll colonize the West, and so, bring on the Internet Age to the world. At least with this book, those people in what remains of the West, can read what their grandparents could have done as they regret the choices of player gods who lost because they refused to play the game.

## Stuff I Couldn't Fit In

I tried to make Techvolution very readable. Almost all the topics and subjects are metaphors for the lessons Europe learned going from the Dark Ages, through the Medieval Ages, to the Science Age, Enlightenment Age, and finally the Industrial Age. So there was a lot of stuff to fit it. If you're a history or philosophy nerd, I hope you realize why I synthesized things the way I did. The benefit was, by keeping things simple, I was forced to better understand the content.

Without changing our path (which I mentioned above, I can only hope is coming) The West really is headed towards societal failure, a new version of the Thirty Years War. That's not supposed to sound alarmist. It's a diagnosis using our history. Every new age needs a new philosophy that unites the people into thinking of the big picture and making a new player god. Unless we create a player god in an era of mass-collaboration soon, we wont stay ahead of our problems and people will fight for a better life using the philosophy of the past; just like our ancestors fought against Catholicism and Protestantism when the real enemy was selfish, effeminate nobility.

If I could travel back to 1618 to those very unhappy Europeans on Main Street, I'd say the same thing to them I told you. But they wouldn't believe it because I'd be talking about the future. With you it's been the past. There's a better chance it'll all click.

By clicking of course I mean upgrading our philosophy. While there are always lots of lessons in all philosophy books, in the game of civilization certain cards or philosophical upgrades are much more important than others. For reference, here's some of the lessons our ancestors taught us in blood, sweat, and tears, and I used in this book.

===

**Modernity**: Inspired by the Renaissance, and started during the Age of Enlightenment. Modernity makes the point when we got modern technology and made modern philosophies. The printing-press, telescope, microscope, and so forth, let humanity develop better philosophies to explain Nature. If I were to have written this book another way, I'd have said modernity is hitting the social sciences, as it did years ago to the physical sciences. Postmodernism and its friends in Left and Right, are phantom chasing geocentrics trying to validate their bygone belief system against the rising tide of evidence a new philosophy is needed.

The point it, we can take all the lessons of the first wave of modernity, and apply it to the second, which is what I did here by referencing the works from Machiavelli to Hegel, but excluded anyone after, because none of them integrated the technological possibilities of the Internet Age. They are like the geocentrics who tried to keep everyone believing the Earth stood still, even after a new and better philosophy was being discovered.

That's why science fiction writers are much better to study then any post modern (supposed) thinker.

**Phantom Communists and Fascists**: The Renaissance, and Scienge Age, was kicked started by Nicolo Machiavelli, who was among the first to implore humanity study cause and effect, to improve our lives on Earth. He asked his contempories to ignore the  "Imagined Principalities" of religious people, who had the people ignoring their real-life pain, because of a belief they'll be rewarded in the afterlife. Any philosophy based on the way things ought to be, had people complain about the real-world, instead of accepting the facts of life, and trying to improve them. Machiavelli called heaven "Imagined Principalities".

Christian belief about an afterlife helped Medieval peasants stay loyal as their community was slowly rebuilding civlization. But by the Renaissance and afterward, only thikning of the afterlife was a needless distraction. Civilization had upgraded, and needed Main Street to start being selfish and take the lead as scientists, doctors, writers and so forth.

I'm making the same point here. That Main Street is distracted from modern philosophy, by holdovers. Just as geocentrics stayed alive by telling the population about "heretic Galileo!", so does our old philosophies stay alive by cries of "they're evil". Instead of "Imagined Principalities" we have "Phantom Communists and Fascists".

**Frontline**: is Machiavelli's "effectual truth." Machiavelli came from a relatively poor family. But he was well educated, and his father gave him many books from the recent printing press. Machiavelli was the first philosoper to get to read lots of different philosophy and history books, and he noticed trends. He told superstitious Europeans, they didn't need to put their faith in God, because we can keep looking for trends, master them, and start to overcome problems like hunger, disease, and all that.

Soon later Galileo, Francis Bacon, and lots of other people, read this insight, and invented the Scientific Method, which systemized looking for "effectual truth" by simply testing Nature with instruments, and discovering the truth, not inventing it with beliefs or reason. Hence, true truth is the "point of contact" between a tool and it's use. That's true in a scientific experiment that upgraded the physical sciences. And now, it's true in the second wave of modernity that will upgraded the social sciences. And for that, the frontline of everyday life is where we'll find the true answers; not the rules of the social or noble heirarchy.

**Player god**: Is my way of saying political community, what Plato called "politia". My version comes from Thomas Hobbes. He lived during the English Civil War, when people were again sick of the king but didn't yet have a different ruling philosophy to replace him with. Hobbes invented human equality by saying in Nature (he called it the State of Nature), all lifeforms live freely, thus why shouldn't humans. Hobbes said people should still be loyal to a king, but not because the king is divine, but because one person having absolute power is in everyone's best interest to have a stable and firm government. When that goes away—as Hobbes was personally seeing—people turn horrible.

And this is what I mean by each philosophy contributed partial upgrades. Because while we don't have kings anymore, yet we use much of Hobbes reasoning. John Locke came after Hobbes and agreed with his State of Nature, but said the people didn't need to put all their trust into a person as leader, but instead put their trust in the institution as leader. Meaning, the people should follow a president, not a king. Moreever, government should be split into different responsibilities for executive, legislature, and judicial. This way, each will "check and balance" each other, and thus government will still function, but won't be easily corrupted and become worse than the anarchy it's supposed to solve.

Rousseau later came and said a true democracy is made up of the people. Unlike Hobbes/Locke, who said humanity was not born from a chaotic Nature, but a kind one. In fact, it's society that corrupts people into being evil. Thus, it's up the way society is structured to ensure the best of humanity is brought up, instead of repressed. Rousseau made the connection that individuals make up their society, so if each individual reformed themselves, they'd all make a better society.

While Rousseau's visions lead to a lot of social engineering disasters. Modern technology and especially open-source, is so liberating, and so individually empowering, we can make a good and just player god. We can have the best of both worlds, a stable government and society, that doesn't need to, and in fact can't, oppress the people.

**The Game of Civilization**: Hegel's March of Reason. G. W. F. Hegel (1770– 1831) distinguished mere fact from history, or from what he called World History. He was the master of the philosophy of history. Rather than let fact silence reason, he tried to infuse reason into fact; he saw the “march of Reason” in the facts of World History. World History, he tried to show, developed in “dialectical” stages until the Rational State was perfected—which by good chance (so Mansfield says) turned out to be the very state of Prussia in which Hegel was living. Here was the end (in the sense of the completion) of history: a state without parties in which there is nothing fundamental left to dispute. Yet as soon as the rational state was announced, everybody—Marx and Nietzsche in the forefront—scrambled to dispute it. Even as Hegel was writing, Tocqueville reproved the sort of democratic history that subjects human events to impersonal forces over which men have no control and that levels mankind to a herd of impotent individuals.

I never read Marx or Nietzche. There was something about inspiring evil that had me stay away. Instead I read science fiction writers, they had the imagination to see the future based on our tools, not on the history of philosophy.

**The Game of Civilization vs. The Story of Civilization**: Or being a player god vs. being an extra. This is Machiavelli's "wised up". Meaning when a civilization is self-aware it takes its survival seriously and not for granted, and thus plays the game, instead of passively watching the events as if it can't determine it's own outcome.

**Your Happiness**: The best gauge on how healthy the player god is.

**Heirarchy**:: is from the friction of distance. The farther people are from the pain, the more likely they're disregard it. So for all her faults, Sofia Auld did teach an enslaved person to read. That's only because she spent time with him everyday. Natural humanity comes out with empathy. And empathy needs to be seen, heard, and felt to exist. That sad truth was, the further away a slave owner was, the more terrible their treatments of slaves. I hate talking like this, and so did Douglass, but a house slave was treated better than a farm slave, who was better off than a plantation slave, who was better off than a colonial slave whose (asshole) "owners" were in a different country. Proximity brings more humanity.

Feeling the pain is the best way to respond to it. The further one is from the frontline, the less natural morality and ethics will prompt a humane response. We use products made by slave labour because we don't feel or see it. Civlizations need heirachries, but with better technology, we don't as much. Thus as civilization needs better technology, that inevitable means dismantling heirarchies is progress.

**The Power of Stories**: Aristotle's Poetics, and especially David Mamet's On Directing Film. Learning storytelling so darn well, it's layers and components, characters and motivations, is what I used to intepret Hegelian dialectics. I'm writing "How to See the Matrix" using these tools. It's much more detailed analysis of all this stuff.

**Ruling philosophy**: comes from Aristotle's regime. Regime is the form of government or the set of rules, cultural or social norms, etc. that regulate the operation of a government or institution and its interactions with society. Aristotle noted  the forms of government are democracy, oligarchy, aristocracy, monarchy. The supreme right to judge and decide is with with either a part or the whole of one or other of these governing powers; which together make up a socieyt's regmine or ruling philosophy.

A Democracy is a form of government under which the citizens distribute the offices of state among themselves, whereas under oligarchy there is a property qualification, under aristocracy one of education. By education I mean that education which is laid down by the law; for it is those who have been loyal to the national institutions that hold office under an aristocracy. These are bound to be looked upon as 'the best men', and it is from this fact that this form of government has derived its name ('the rule of the best'). Monarchy, as the word implies, is a rule which one man has authority over all. There are two forms of monarchy: kingship, which is limited by prescribed conditions, and 'tyranny', which is not limited by anything.

We must also notice the ends which the various forms of government pursue. The end of democracy is freedom; of oligarchy, wealth; of aristocracy, the maintenance of power, education, and national institutions; of tyranny, the protection of the tyrant.

**Protagonist and antagonist**: is Hegel's Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis dialectics. After centuries of histories, looked back at the trends, and said there was a ruling philosophy, whose problems manifested into a competitor, the two would eventually fight it out, and make a new ruling philosphy that merged the two together. He also said master–slave is a relationship that recurs throughout humanity, and is the reason we looked at Frederick Douglas and Neo, who while was the physical slave, his captors were the mental ones, bound to a horrible social system as much as Frederick was. Frederick's process of self-discovery, was how slaves realize their status and break free.

**Cyborgology, majic, frontline**: are Darwinism. The evolution of lifeforms based on their tools to collect resources. Life started out as simple organisms, and as these primitive lifeforms struggled to survive, they adapted better —biological—tools to do so. Eventually the benefits of biology maxed out with us, and so we have to continue evolution with tools. We similarly started to evolve (techvolve) with primitive tools, which slowly got better and better.

**Mixed Ideological Politics**: This didn't make it into ANP. But it's based on the separation of Church and State. Except now it's the separation of ideology and economy.

**The Death Star**: working insurance :)

**Freedom to use any tool**: Comes from freedom of religion and speech. John Locke and his A Letter Concerning Toleration, gets the nod here.

**Dark majic**: come from modern psychology. All of this is hard to understand. It seems simple because it's your life, and you think your opinions matter. But there's a reason we go to the doctor when we're feeling sick. They know the human antonmy, and we don't, even though we own one.

**Techvolution**: Comes from me. It synthesizes all that we've learned, into a new philosophy for a modern age. I attributed much of it to playing computer games, reading and watching science fiction, and working lots of frontline jobs. Playing, reading, and living in the future made the old philosophies of 20th Century politics so old fashioned. Putting it all together into a book took lots of reading, thinking, and working. Some intelligence helped, but it was the stubborness to keep going, and the belief in a higher power, that deserves the most credit. I hope it was worth it.

===

So, that's where it all came from. Machiavelli taught regular people to stop hoping for a better life, and start making one. Hobbes/Locke taught us our government can be instruments for liberty. Rousseau said we, the people, could make up government if we empowered our better natures. Hegel taught us the difference between Protagonsits and Antagonists, Player Gods, and Extras. Galileo taught us to use tools to see the Truth. Darwin taught us life is nothing but the evolution of new tools. And Majic, he taught us that technology is an extension of life, that player gods can use to improve this world, once we believe in ourselves. Or he wasted far too much time writing to himself. Either way, it's confusing and fitting Faith made him keep going.

I spent my 20's wondering what the next few pages of "A Student's Guide to Political Philosophy" were going to be. Even weirder, like Newton using his own eyes for lenses, I used myself as a proxy for life under the Life Star. A life of austerity, simplicity, childish honesty, great friendships, and self induced hypersensity to all frontline pain so easily brushed aside by extras. I feel confident to say I now know the next few pages of our political philosophy because I wrote and lived it; although I'd never pay the price again.

Cheers.
