# TECHVOLUTION: A NEW PHILOSOPHY

## Backpage

Are you happy? On the outside, Westerners have flashy products, full employment, and stable politics. On the inside, our middle-class deals with stagnate wages, crushing debts, antisocial behavior, political hatred, climate change. We have the freedom to vote Left or Right, moderate or extreme, and we've tried them all, but none have helped.

In this book, I argue our unhappiness is a sign of a bigger problem. Our ideologies are very outdated. They were created in the Industrial Age, and since 1970, we've been in the Computer Age. Our ideologies are holding us back, which is causing our frustrating lifestyles and massive social problems. We need a new philosophy—one created to harness the remarkable potential of electronic tools.

Here it is. Its big lesson is this. The middle-class has to step up and use digital technology to solve our own problems. If we don't, we'll keep suffering the pains of civilization running on old—ideological—fumes.

## Dedication

_This book is for the people in the open-source community. For the collaboration philosophy you handed down to me. For selflessly updating Wikipedia, writing free software, and building cool new tech for us all. For being the protagonists of the Computer Age. You gave the best education a political guy can get. I hope I’ve learned enough to write this book._

_For the antagonists, the self-entitled delegators keeping Blockbuster—and it's Industrial Age mentality—alive, thanks for causing history to repeat itself yet again. I hope you learn something._

_This is especially dedicated to the extras on Main Street. Because when it’s time for you to act, I pray you decide to play the game._

# Introduction

## Looking Up

How do we develop through technological Ages? Going from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age or the Medieval Age to Science Age happens over generations—it can be hard to get our head around. I've been thinking about it for years and only now have a grasp. There's a lot to think about when a civilization's entire way of life upgrades to new technology.

Play computer games like _Age of Empires, Anno 1800_, and _Civilization_, and you'll get to see how civilizations develop. You'll be the "player god" who organizes society, gives people orders, saves up resources, invests in research, and decides when to click "upgrade". When you do, your civilization instantly transforms. Like magic, every house, factory, building, road, library, school is suddenly new and improved by the technology of a new age.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/FortunateFluffyAfricanporcupine' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

The above is a game, of course, but it represents reality pretty well. We're all in there somewhere right now, trying to figure out how to earn a living while our society changes around us. It's hard—there is no player god and no magic button. Instead, we, the people inside the game, must collect the resources, do the research, and manually transform every part of our civilization bit by bit with blood, sweat, and tears. We can't sit back, click, and watch. We must live it.

Improving technology is hard work, but at least we understand how to do research and development. Improving politics isn't so straightforward, especially when society has one foot in an old era and one foot in a new one. This is a time of politics and philosophy, civil wars and revolutions I want to help you understand your importance in. Because in 1970, we entered the Computer Age. Since then, computer geeks, innovators, and hackers have been upgrading our society with ever more powerful electronic ones. All the while, established companies and bureaucracies of the Industrial Age have been holding them back.

Being forced to use old Industrial Age mechanical tools is why middle-class life is getting worse. Things will only improve once we finish the Computer Age upgrade. There's no shortcuts, cheats, or gimmicks. There's just you and your friends on Main Street. We all have to get out the sweat-bands, work gloves, and new ideas to upgrade every piece of our civilization to the Computer Age, bit by bit.

This book integrates lessons from the history, politics, and philosophy of prior upgrades, but it's not written for any buff. It uses the power of stories to help the middle-class improve their own lives. The first step is a new mindset. Because the people already have amazing smartphones, 3D printing, and high-speed internet. We only need to believe in a modern philosophy to enjoy all the wonders of the Computer Age.

## Looking Up at Philosophy - We develop with new tools and philosophys

This book's illustration is a regular person standing on Main Street-a single person in civilization. His or her job is to do what's best for themselves, and help society prosper. She's looking up for guidance and sees two options—heroes and villains. In the sky high above is the mythical "player god" whose playing the game. Will he play to benefit society or to benefit himself?

ILLUSTRATION

In a computer game, when the player god presses the upgrade button, society instantly transforms. In reality, we upgrade society when we buy groceries, do car maintenance, and save up for a new home. Funny to think about, but our choices while shopping, dieting, socializing determine the health of our entire civilization. Yet we often don't think of ourselves as being "player gods". But that's the big picture, isn't it? That, in fact, it's all our individual choices that make up the player god in our real-life game of civilization.

The more individuals realize the big picture and act like their actions matter, the healthier their society. And the job of inspiring individuals to believe in the big picture is the job of philosophy.

So what the heck are good political choices today? Who are the good guys? Every newspaper, politician, and political party says they're fighting for the good of our civilization. But politics has so much disagreement. How can the regular person know the difference between heroes and villains?

So there you are, on Main Street, looking up, trying to figure if Donald Trump is evil, or if the United Nations is trying to make a world government. You ask if Fox News is manufacturing fake news, or maybe "all of them" are. If so, what's real news? The questions never stop. Should the government-run health insurance, or a big corporation regulated by the government? Is climate change real? If so, why does my "green" obsessed company force me to drive to work every day?

It's all very confusing and emotional. Yet you have to pick sides. After all, you're part of the player god as much as anyone else. Wouldn't it be cool if a philosophy showed you the difference between good and bad politics today? It is cool; it's calming to understand politics. And it's one reason why I wrote this book. So I, and whoever reads it, can better understand what's wrong with our society today. I also wrote this book to create a new philosophy. Once that'll let us upgrade to, and finally enjoy, the glorious Computer Age.

## Your Politics Is Hard to See, Because You Are Changing

Philosophies are created to help organize society. They have high, and often hard to understand, ideals of a "just and good society". There are many options to choose from, such as Athen's Democracy, Rome's Republic, Soviet Union's Dictatorship. The trick is to pick one that helps society use modern technology to solve real-life problems, and hence let the people to live a happy life.

When a computer player in a civilization game upgrades technology, we can see technology changed. Installing a sewer, damning a river, building a road, is very obvious. But we can't see philosophy in real-world objects. Philosophy exists in our minds. Thus we have ideals in our heads that we sometimes don't understand.

For example, we all believe in a philosphy of "Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." But we're unsure what that means in everyday life. And this is where ideologies come in. Conservative or Progressive. Libertarian or Socialist. Republican or Democrat. All these ideologies idealize "Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness", but each ideology has their own interpretation. They fight for your attention by calling themselves heroes and the others villians. Individuals pick an ideology to help make their political opinions.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/GrimyHonestFallowdeer' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Chosing which technology and philosophy you want really is as simple as a click; as the player does in the clip above. It's just so damn hard to see when it comes to philosophy and politics because it's our minds that are changing.

That being said, people are good at picking an ideology and then fighting for their political opinions. It's pretty easy to argue, debate, vote, watch TV, and listen to radio shows. But understanding our political opinions is entirely different. Few people say, "My family is old money. I have a huge trust fund. So I'm coasting through life.". Instead, that person says, "White privilege doesn't exist stupid!" Nobody says, "I'm gullible and I work with lots of Liberal Arts graduates, so I don't like Trump because the crowd hates him." Instead, that person says, "Trump is not presidential!"

The point is, even with ideologies to guide our opinions, the real reason for our political views is hard to know. We all look up at the same ideologies; we all try to "think of the big picture," yet we arrive at different answers. Our opinions are a by-product of our psychology, job, skillset, family, culture, ethnicity, religion, time-period. Who can understand how all these factors intermix to make a political opinion? Why does one parent cry tears of sadness, the other of joy, on the same election night?

I can't explain it either. But I can tell help you better understand your life today. We live inside the story of civlization. It's a story that spans thousands of years of technological upgrades from the Bronze Age, to Iron Age, the Mediaeval Age, and so on. And when humanity hits a new age, everyone becomes divided into the same cast of characters. The rich establishment struggles to retain power for themselves, the idealistic inventors fight to distribute power to the people, and the people on Main Street make a choice.

Does the regular person help the protagonists upgrade civilization, or help the antagonists hold back progress? And here's where you on Main Street come in. If you stay out of the fight, you are an extra watching the story of civilization. If you decide to jump in and fight to upgrade civlization to the new age, you're a player god, playing the game of civilization. A player god is an activated extra.

We hit the Computer Age in 1970. Since then hackers, genises, and geeks have been fighting to give the incredible power of electronics to Main Street. The people who control Industrial Age technology are fighting them off. And the people on Main Street have a choice, do they step up to help the good guys? That's a choice you, the person reading this right now, has to make. It's a choice as big as any you're ever going to make. Because if we don't upgrade now, it only means your kids will grow up even more behind the times, and live even unhappier lives.

Don't worry. We can upgrade without too much work of effort. Because to help the most, the people only need to believe in a new philosophy. One that turns them all into player gods.

## Read Now or Read Later - We either change our minds now, or we fail the game

There's a heck of a lot of emotions in Western politics today. Better put—people fucking hate each other. And many of those people don't know why. They're just mad. And not mad in the "I stepped in the puddle" sort of way. Mad in the supervillain whose plans for world domination are going up in smoke "because the other side is ruining everything!" sort of way.

Let's get some perspective. People's days are increasingly unhappy. We pick an ideology to help us. Conservatism and Progressivism are the big choices. Both of them spread around the world on the back of the Industrial Age. The bent towards wealth creation of Conservatives, and the priority of wealth distribution of Progressives, causes a constant tug of war over regulations, tax rates, subsidies, and other government policies. However, property creation and distribution are increasingly easy with digital property. Digital books, manuals, paperwork, money, is so much easier to create and distribute than physical property. As our world becomes more virtual in the Computer Age, the old Industrial Age mentalities make less and less sense.

But rather than rethink hundreds of years of "Left vs. Right" politics, ideologues doubledown on their beliefs. They can't see philosophy inevitably changes with every new age. Instead Left and Right blames the other for being outdated. Businessmen keep Conservatism interesting with constant stories of "fighting evil communists who are coming for your money!", while social justice warriors keep Progressivism gripping by "fighting racist fascists who want to put you in chains!". Fascism and communism (thankfully) died decades ago. Left and Right ideologies keep their audience engaged by creating, then fighting, phantoms. It makes for great television.

Entertainment is their plan. Left and Right want their supporters to stay as extras. That's why both use phantom ideologies to call themselves the good guys. But neither party knows how to usher in the Computer Age. When Main Street ask why their commutes are so long, home payments so high, bosses so many Left and Right both ramp up their CNN, Fox News spectacle like movie studio's ramping up the special effects in blockbuster movie.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEczkhfLwqM
_Notice how the divide started in the 1970s and as grown since. That's because both neither Left or Right know what to do in the Computer Age. This is an extremely bad and worrying trend._

Sadly, the story of mutual hatred doesn't stop until old ideologies kill each other off. The Thirty Years War (1618-1648) is an example. This was a war between the kingdoms of Europe, whose royal families ruled with a "divine right to rule". Back then every royal family was either Catholic of Protestant. And these religions were the only political philosophies the people could choose. Thus, when regular people demanded a better life, they picked a team and slaughtered "the other side" on behalf of supposed holy kings. The Thirty Years War can be summed up as “The voices from the seventeenth century...offer a warning of the dangers of entrusting power to those who feel summoned by God to war, or feel that their sense of justice and order is the only one valid.”

The Thirty Years War was extremely brutal. Main Street was so unhappy with their lives they kept fighting. The carnage only stopped when both sides were exhausted. The worst part was when the horror ended, the people realized they were no better off—and what they were sick of all along was kings. Protestant or Catholic kings were bot bad ideas. Thus, it wasn't long until ordinary people finally upgraded to a new ruling philosophy. As player gods, they fought for Democracy in the American Revolution (1776) and the French Revolution (1789).

Today Left and Right are in a similar boat as Catholics and Protests political ideologies once were.The constant fights over impeachments, disputed elections, rallies, and trigger words, are what two factions do when neither can admit they're both behind the times. Here's the crucual point, both sides think they're the player gods help the protagnists of society advance civilization. But neither is. Because they're Industrial Age philosphies, they help Industrial powers hold society back from upgrading to the Computer Age.

It's important to remember, Conservativism and Progressivism helped us achieve great things in the Industrial Age. But politics is only supposed to help people see the big picture—that all our individual choices matter—so our civilization plays the game well. Ideologies should never be self-serving. Conservatives and Progressives are. Neither can help regular people live happy lives in the Computer Age.

Do people today watch TV or exercise at night? Do we read a book or watch infotainment? Do we seal your leaky taps or rant about climate change with another tweet? We are all a single person in the game. We can only change our own actions. And our efforts are pivotal. Because you are the player god. Ideology is only supposed to help people realize that. If it doesn't then it's time to throw it away and install a new one.

For our society to see the big-picture again, we need a new philosophy. One that looks ahead towards the boundless horizon of the Computer Age. One that sees the work of protagonists like Tesla, SpaceX, Blue Origin, as a sneak peek for the wondrous future each person should be building now, bit by bit.

I've studied this topic for years. Both academically, at work, and in business. I could have written this has a political theory book or a history book. Instead, it's written as how-to-manual to the people on Main Street right now. Here's how we fix our problems and win the game. You'll like it best if you're sick of contemporary politics but love checking-out what Elon is up to. Because you'll understand most of today's talking points that drive Left and Right to hatred, are with digital technology rather simple engineering problems. Road traffic, health insurance, government debt aren't time-travel or teleportation. You'll really like this book if you know that unless we see ourselves in the video below, evolution will find someone who does.

Dreaming about our civilization's future is not a joke. Humanity will continue the blessed journey of civilization with or without you. I wrote this book to get you dreaming again. It's written to be like _Second Treatise of Government, On Social Contract_, and _Common Sense_. All books that helped start modern democracies because they made unhappy people on Main Street realize the big picture, that we're all the player god. Today, if we don't step up to upgrade our philosophy to the Computer Age, we'll keep suffering the unknowns of a degenerating society. We'll be extras watching stories of phantom socialists and fascists, instead of looking up to a future as player gods in the stars.

And if we don't step up, at least with this book, we can read what we could have done as we regret the choices of player gods who lost, because they refused to play the game.

## Here's the Grand Mission of Techvolution

Writer David Mamet once said being free from trying to please a group means being free to concentrate on Nature. So I embraced obscurity and was quite ambitious when writing this book. Saying that, Techvolution is divided into three parts:

**I. A New Philosophy:** This part upgrades our political philosophy to the Computer Age. It gets Main Street to see the big picture, that they're all player gods who must use digital tools to solve their own problems.

**II. Building the Life Star:** Explains the new political and economic truth we'll see in the Computer Age with technologies like apps, bio-monitors, and big data. Soon, we'll be able to create definitions of political and economic right and wrong objectively. The Life Star will show us where our political opinions come from, and therefore remove phantom storytelling in our politics. In short, the Life Star will do for politics and economics what scientific instruments did for physics, chemistry, biology, etc. The troubling part is many people won't accept what this new telescope shows us.

**III. Starting Starfleet:** We'll conceptualize digital tools totally detached from the Industrial Age. These products will make The Computer Age lifestyle one of "perpetual profit." We'll send the massive savings to Musk and his protegees and hence, start Starfleet.

===

Techvolution, A New Philosophy, has a pretty high goal. So, I want to be crystal clear about its purpose. We're in the new and wondrous Computer Age. But we're using the philosophy of the Industrial Age to run our society. That means not since the Conservatism (1791), and Progressivism (1859) philosophy cards were clicked have we had fundamentally new ideas in politics.

We need a new philosophy that factors in all the wondrous possibilities of digital technology. A philosophy that builds on the accomplishments of the past. We need a philosophy that empowers the people on Main Street to again see the big picture; that they're player gods whose choices determine the health of society. Watching TV isn't politics. Making good choices is politics. You should still vote, still debate what's best for your community, still debate what good choices are, but using digital tools to improve your life, is your most potent political power. If other people don't follow, get them on board. If they yell out in Twitter comments that "you can't change the world!" leave them behind. Evolution sure will.

The people on Main Street today thus have the responsibility to find tools to solve their problems, which thereby solves the problems that plague today's middle class. The duty to solve problems also requires the freedom to choose any tool they want.

Tools can be anything: a thermal camera to spot leaky windows, the Waze app to lessen gridlock, or 3D printing a tool for your new business. The desire to seek out new tools is human evolution. Human evolution first happens in the human mind that reads a modern philosophy telling it to become a player god. We've upgraded our philosophy before. The book below is the best way I know how to do it for our society today. I hope it's good enough to click.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOOOfZWXPu4
_These guys run a popular YouTube channel about computer hardware. They didn't like how YouTube changed in recent years and decided to make a new video service called Floatplane. That is real politics. Because it promotes evolution. It doesn't matter if Floatplane thrives or dies. We, as individuals, can only try new things and see what works. Solving problems, or supporting problem-solvers, is being a player god. Marching against climate change, screaming about Trump, or watching infotainment television is simply being an extra. The struggle within our society today is regular people don't think to act like player gods. And even worse, it's often against the rules to because Industrial Age companies want us to keep using their stuff. More on overcoming that antagonism below._

# Prologue

## Fighting For The Computer Age - Our philosophy is already generations behind technology

From 1850 onwards inventors like Lovelace, Bush, and Bardeen were starting the Computer Revolution. Along side came stories from authors like H.G. Wells, George Orwell, Isaac Asimov who imagined what life would be like after the Industrial Age ended. Books such as _The Time Machine, War of the Worlds_, and _I, Robot_ thought of a future so weird people called it science fiction. Then came the 1970's; when personal computers, the internet, email, and other digital technology became real products anyone could buy. Humanity finally entered the Computer Age. And it was just as different as science fiction said it would be.

With every purchase, renovation, and Christmas gift since we've been upgrading our society with fundamentally different technology. Computers can be programmed, updated, and inter-linked. Digital property can be shared, erased, copied, and transferred with a few button clicks. A single laptop today can be a typewriter, radio, voice recorder, book, television, photo album, database, and so many other machines. In contrast, mechanical tools—like books, printers, radios— are single use, can't be easily shared, and are so big they need much environmental and labour regulations.

Even though they're different, digital tools have been brought up within the Industrial Age's Right and Left philosophy. This philosophy is meant to encourage the growth of mechanical tools via relentless worldwide competition so easily seen on CNBC. Digital devices enable a new philosophy, one that fosters collaboration. Working together online is our future because it saves us from so much redundant work. For example, with Wikipedia, the world can use one website for its general knowledge, instead of reprinting, shipping, and buying millions of encyclopedia books every year.

Several generations from the start of the Computer Age, items like smartphones, laptops, and smartwatches are so standard, the collaboration philosophy they foster is increasingly part of our lifestyle. That's why WikiHow, IMDB, YouTube integrate so easily into our lives. Collaboration is today's big picture, the basic principle of the Computer Age's new philosophy. The people who see this best is the open-source community.

## Open-Source Protagonists Pushing Us Into the Computer Age

Open-source is a community of digital inventors, designers, and programmers. They are the successors of the first digital protagonists—the ones leading us into the Computer Age. They live, breath, and promote collaboration at places like GitHub, Wikipedia, Dribbble, Udemy, Stack Overflow, Unsplash, and Slack.

Open-source has given the world the Computer Age. Even if the world doesn't know it yet. Most people on the frontline still think that retail stores, manufacturing, and education are industries only for governments or big businesses to control. However, because of the open-source community, there are countless new tools available for the people to take control of their own products, identities, and lives. It's truly a new world. One where Cinderella can stop praying a fairy godmother gets her through palace gates; today she can walk off of Main Street and go right to the ball because... everyone's always invited.

The open-source community exists to bust down the technological gates of the Industrial Age. They've empowered the people to share in our society's economic prosperity. Look around. Note the parents who are educating their own children on Khan Academy, the moms learning how to repair iPads for extra cash thanks to YouTube videos, the artists selling their own products on their own Wordpress websites, and the laid-off workers using Rails to make their own apps. Digital tools cut out the Industrial Age middle-man and empower regular people to work for themselves and collaborate with each other.

In short, the open-source community has empowered people used to be extras in the Industrial Age, hoping for a better life. Now they've become player gods in the Computer Age, making a better life.

I'm one of them. I'm a politics, history, and philosophy geek who spends far too much time thinking about this stuff. Digital tools let me research, write, and host my own work. Better yet, I can find and work with world-class writers and illustrators to make that work even better. A few decades ago, I'd be in a library scribbling notes on cue cards and dreaming up ways to get a professor, publisher, or newscaster to look my way. Now I can share what I've learned with a Ghost website so anyone can access it from anywhere in the world. It may not seem like it, but you the reader, and me the writer, are on Main Street right now, collaborating about where to take the "player god." All for virtually free. And that's all because the open-source heroes put new tools into both our hands.

## Mass Production Replaced by Mass Collaboration - Computer Age philosophy is collaboration/happy

As a kid, I helped my family clean office buildings. My simple role was to pick up the garbage and blue bins. It was straightforward. Years later, when working at a big office, the cleaners were short-staffed for a few weeks. Management spent hours meeting about and discussing the "garbage problem" instead of just wrapping it up (pun intended) and moving on.

The Industrial Age only had mechanical tools. Mass producing clothes, cars, newspapers needed lots of people maning the machines and thus lots of managers. However, today software can now replace much of that managerial work and let workers coordinate with each other.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(76.67% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/ObedientNiftyBlackbear' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p> <a href="https://gfycat.com/obedientniftyblackbear">via Gfycat</a></p>

Today's excessive management is a holdover from an age gone by. It's out of habit that our workplaces over-value control and delegation instead of contribution and collaboration. Excessive management turns leaders into gatekeepers. They seek to hold tickets and manage who'll "get access" to things like news services, retail stores, formal education, and especially the higher "positions" of corporate employment. Today's there's an entire class of middle-men, consultants, managers, and executives who don't know the skills of their industry like nursing, teaching, and (definitely not) cleaning. Their power is to manage the gates of an Industrial Age technology.

The Computer Age demands mass collaboration—sometimes called "Wikinomics". Open-source shows us how easy and effective mass collaboration is. Here's the jist. The open-source community works together on a core technology that's free to use. People then use the core technology to create their own specialized products. For example, a large open-source community creates MediaWiki software. Then separate groups use MediaWiki to create Wikipedia, WikiHow, and Fandom—or any other website you can think of. After all, MediaWiki is free for anyone to use however they want. And if you you can't write software, write a Wikipedia article. If you can't write, then draw a diagram. Wikipedia wants to "store the sum of all human knowledge", there's alway lots of work to do. Digital technology empowers us to find places that need work, instead of competing to be published in a book. Mass collaboration works so well Wikipedia wrote millions of articles in just a few years.

This is not to say that open-source communities are perfect and can run the world. Some of its people are too rude, projects die off, personalities clash, and so forth. In _The Innovators_, author Walker Isaacson explains how the trifecta of academia, corporations, and militaries was optimal for creating the digital revolution. Likewise, it was government, big business, and open-source organizing structures that worked to keep that revolution going. Open-source is only a part of the ecosystem bringing the Digitial Age and mass collaboration to life. There will always be big companies like Google, Microsoft with large corporate structures, always be government services running health care plans and installing traffic lights.

That said, open-source is vital.

Precisely because nobody owns its technology. Server software, operating systems, web apps, and so much other software is free to use. That means Industrial Age gatekeepers can't stop digital inventors empowering more player gods, enabling more collaboration, and pushing us into the Computer Age. Whether it's with a simple rotating list of persons to take out the trash. An online encyclopedia with millions of helpful articles. Or software to give society internet streaming. As when a few hackers tore down "Darth Blockbuster's" gate when he tried to keep us all buying and borrowing his VHS tapes and DVDs.

Open source is the good guys. The Jedi of our society. The modern minutemen because they enable individual empowerment and collaboration. They should be self-sufficient and very well-funded. But they are not. Many people in the open-source community who write articles, answer forum questions, and make programs do it as a hobby, not a job. Even their leading organizations need donations to stay afloat. Meanwhile, old tools such as universities, television broadcasters, and insurance companies get massive subsidies, tax credits, and bailouts.

To bring on the era of mass collaboration. Open-source needs to be flush with cash, and the support of the middle class. That means you have to become a player god.

## Fighting for The Future - The Collaboration Future Won't Just Happen

This difference between how the old and new tools are treated signifies our society's significant problem. We should be jumping into the Computer Age. But open-source heroes have to struggle against the odds to dismantle the gates Industrial Age antagonists are paid to maintain.

Once upon a time, I only wanted to learn about the open-source fight. Now I want to empower its protagonists. Mass collaboration, telecommuting, the right to repair, home power generation, and real internet privacy are just the tip of the iceberg. A better world is waiting once the open-source community has the resources to not only make new digital tools but to replace old Industrial Age tools. The open-source community must get political, get mad, and learn to be selfish. Because today's political battle is about upgrading society to the Computer Age. It's a story about New Age versus Old Age. Protagonists versus antagonists. Jedi versus Sith.

The most dangerous thing right now is ignorance. People don't know about open-source or the future they're fighting for. The people are stuck on "right vs. left" or "red vs. blue" politics. Red/blue leaders tout their horns, and the believers march and yell like it's Woodstock in 1969, because that was the end of the Industrial Age, and hence was the peak of their philosophy. The Woodstock way of life of single detached homes, 9-5 jobs, gas cars, long commutes, retail shopping, centralized power stations, and advertisement funded nightly news is a memory of "the glory days." It's no wonder Main Street has suffered from outsourcing, micro-managing, and climate change when the political stage fights to keep the past alive.

The open-source community doesn't march for change, their digital tools force it. I worked hard to turn their collaboration mindset into a new philosophy, which I call Techvolution. It's custom-made for open-source, the Computer Age, and to create more player gods. It combines centuries of historical and philosophical lessons most people don't have the time to read. It cuts through today's political jargon with terms like "Darth Blockbuster," "Death Star Rulebook," and "Jedi vs. Sith." So people can ask themselves the most important political question of our time.

It's not the worn-out and drab, "Am I for red or blue politics?" Instead, it's something far more powerful and relevant: "Am I going to step up and bring my society into the Computer Age?"

To do it, the people have to believe in a new philosophy. One that rewards workers, creators, and collaborators—basically, the people who are willing to become player gods of the Computer Age. And that's the only political question you should be asking yourself. Today, choosing Red or Blue doesn't matter any more than voting for Protestant or Catholic on the ballot.

_This is Louis Rossmann. He repairs computers, which saves his customers lots of money. More than that, he advocates electronics should be better built and easy to repair. Some manufacturers, notably Apple, make it hard to repair our computers because they want us to replace them. Louis testifies before legislative committees and posts videos about his business and thoughts. He also teaches others how to open up their own repair business. You don't have to support his "right to repair" campaign (you should though). The point is because of digital technology and open-source, he easily collaborates with supporters, runs a business, and thereby changes his society. Another example of a player god doing real politics._

## Open-Source Lets Us Bust Open Gates And Start The Future Now

Currently, when you phone a call center, everything is recorded. The company has access to the recording; you don't. Likewise, when the employee logs in and out of the office, that, too, is recorded. Management automatically has access to these timesheets; the employee doesn't.

Access to things like phone recordings and timesheets are barriers or "gates." They're holdovers from the mechanical tools of the Industrial Age. They needlessly give power to one person over another. Customers can't confirm what was agreed to during their last phone call, and employees can be grilled for a long lunch. Yet, the same manager quickly forgets unpaid overtime.

A lopsided balance of power allows customers and employees to be taken advantage of and encourages mistrust, bad products, and inefficient workplaces. Uneven power makes collaboration impossible and prevents people from becoming player gods.

The greatness of the digital tools of the open-source community is threefold. First, it sets a great example because it entrusts everyone with all information. Second, open-source wants more members, so the community loves to bust open gates to get more people in. And third, since no one owns open-source technology, the people can empower ourselves with tools that we wrongly only big companies are "allowed" to have—like phone-call recordings and timesheets.

Busting open gates of mechanical tools move us from the Industrial to Computer Age. It equalizes the balance of power. It treats people like adults and expects them to act like it, and therefore fosters collaboration. We have the technology to do this now. We need the people to step up, participate, and demand it.

Once we do, all workers—from waitresses, mechanics, teachers—will start to be managed less and collaborate more. It'll be a massive change, similar to how factories and production lines swept across our society during the Industrial Age. However, even once we become player gods, we're going to have to fight to live in the wondrous Computer Age.

_This is the GitHub "repo" for Ruby on Rails, the technology that helps run apps like Basecamp, Airbnb, and Shopify. A core team of paid pros maintains and does much of the programming. But all programmers, from elite to novice, individually ask questions, find bugs, contribute their work, and it all comes together via GitHub's software with minimal supervision. The process works similarly to Wikipedia. It's very organized; even with over 5,000 contributors over 15 years, you can see who has done what and when. Ruby on Rails software is priceless and is yours to use however you want. Get familiar with how open-source works. It's a tell-tale sign for the openness, responsibility, and immense value of work cultures coming in the Computer Age. You should be happy! Once you experience how easy, effective, and powerful worker-to-worker collaboration is, it makes work much better. And the best part, no garbage meetings or delegators are needed._

## The Setup to our Story - How we get to the future

We all have to step up and upgrade our way of life to the Computer Age. If we don't, we'll keep suffering the pains of a degenerating society. This means Main Street has to stop chasing phantom communistis and fascists on television, and become player gods who take responsibility for their society. That's a hard step, but as open-source projects like Wikipedia, Linux, and Andriod shows, is slowly happening.

The biggest roadblock to the Computer Age is Darth Blockbuster—the self-entitled holdover from the Industrial Age. Like Darth King before him, Darth Blockbuster has made a career of making up rules to keep his Industrial Age tools, and himself, in power. Before we can enter the Computer Age, we have to get rid of him.

And that's the set-up to the story of your life. Will you become a player god and take on Darth Blockbuster? It's not at all dramatic to say this, the fate of your life, children, and civilization is weighing in the balance. I really hope you pick the right side. In the story below, I'll explain the philosophy that will help you win the fight.

## Cast of Ideas and Characters

Before we plunge into the story of Techvolution, here are a few terms that will put us all on the same page:

===

**Player god:** Imagine a person playing a computer "civilization building" game with our society. In this game that person would decide where to put roads or how much to fund cancer research. Of course, there is no such player. In reality, it's the choices of individuals that decide what the community does. The player god is thus the collective consciousness of society. Crucially, only if, people decide to take responsibility for the civilization and "play the game" with the real-life.

**Philosophy:** The largely unspoken ideals that tell individuals what’s right and wrong, good and bad, in science, art, morals, politics, and economics. Philosophy is supposed to unite individuals to see the big picture; that everyone's choices matter, because everyone is a player god.

**Ruling philosophy**: A civilization’s chosen philosophy. One that all factions/ideologies agree on. Examples include the "Divine Rights of Kings," derived from Christian theology and used in royalist Europe; "Marxist-Leninism" of the Soviet Union; and the combination of "red/blue" philosophies of the Western world today.

**Rule book**: The written and unwritten social, workplace, and legal rules that govern everyday life. The rule book is interpreted from the ruling philosophy.

**Technology:** A catchall term for things we make tools from, like concrete, lumber, nails, shingles, insulation, and bricks.

**Tool**: A catchall term for things we create with technology to solve a problem, like guns to kill bad guys, books to record and pass on knowledge, and houses to shelter in.

**Frontline:** The point of contact between a tool and the problem. Nurses giving vaccines, cleaners cleaning a city bus, and soldiers on the battlefield are all examples of frontline settings. People on the frontline work no Main Street with jobs that solve specific problems with a demonstrable skillset.

**Hierarchy**: A power structure that manages every tool’s use by society. Kings and queens with the keys to the castle, for example. As hierarchies grow larger, the bigger its authority gets, but also the more detached it gets from the frontline. People in the regime have titles like prince and executive, baron, and supervisor to mark their position—and, in a sense, their territory and "rights" in the power structure.

**The story of civilization**: The invention of new technology and the creation of new tools to overcome the most recent frontline problems. Civilization develops in technological ages; as new tools are adopted, they topple the hierarchies based on the tools of the prior age. We use tools to evolve.

**Protagonists**: People who invent, spread, and use new technology and new tools for the greater good. Usually close to the problems on the frontline, they individually struggle, but their continued self-sacrifice slowly and collectively improves life on Earth. I call them this world’s Jedi knights. We call their leaders trailblazers who often skirt the rules; Galileo, Nikola Tesla, Jay Last, Michael S. Hart, BIll Gates, Steve Jobs, Linus Torvalds, and Elon Musk are among their number.

**Antagonists**: People who selfishly resist new tools to defend their wealth, power, and prestige atop a hierarchy. Antagonists usually manage companies or institutions based on dated technologies and think that working on the frontline is beneath them. They work to control the rule book, so they can hide behind it. We don’t often individually identify them. I coined the term "Darth Blockbuster" so we can.

**Extras**: Everybody in the middle of a battle between antagonists and protagonists. Because they have no direct loyalty to either side or their tools, extras can pick winners and losers. Usually, extras are in the middle class, not so poor as to be desperate, but not so powerful that they want to keep the world the same. Sadly, extras don’t realize their power. When they do, they become player gods.

**The Death Star**: The rule book when it’s controlled by Darth Blockbuster. Today it exists inside countless regulations, agreements, contracts, laws, and manuals that prevent new digital tools being used by people. The Death Star works to keep the Industrial Age alive.

**Techvolution**: A new philosophy empowering seamless human technological evolution by ridding Darth Blockbuster of his power, by turning extras into players gods who have the right and duty to decide when society should upgrade our tools.

**The Life Star**: A rule book based on Techvolution, governed by human technological adaption and natural selection that makes sure humanity never stalls when upgrading to the next technological age.

**Plot**: Getting the extras to step up, become player gods, replace their ruling philosophy, and establish the Computer Age.

# ACT ONE

## A Small Upgrade Meets a Big Roadblock

It all started with a door in my face. And then, actually, a few more. I was either being too stubborn or too hopeful. Either way, I eventually learned my lesson. I was selling a web app that those in upper management weren't going to buy.

Before you wonder, it wasn't a matter of price, because there was no price. It wasn't a question of competition. None of that either. And I can promise it worked because I had spent years in a cubicle doing the frontline job it serviced. After years of thinking about political and economic theory in the Computer Age, I'd written a book (Starting Starfleet) about some untapped possibilities of new tech like smartwatch apps, bio-monitors, and bitcoin. I only made this simple web app (using open-source technologies) to validate some of my ideas.

I was right to. They were good ideas. I figured out how to solve a problem that saved 100 million dollars, 300,000 hours of worker productivity, and even dozens of lives. All I did was enable worker-to-worker collaboration with an app that was virtually free. Why wouldn't I want to tell people about the theory behind it?

Sadly, I was a fool. I didn't know it at the time, but I wasn't even knocking on doors. I was knocking on gates. See, I wasn't talking to the frontline workers (who thanked me). But to the bureaucrats, lawyers, managers, and executives who were well paid to "meet, discuss, delegate" about such "garbage" problems. As holdovers from the management of the Industrial Age, I went against all they stood for; solving their problems was asking them to fire themselves. Worse, I was asking them to invalidate their identity as being "superiors." They put up gates to shut out, not promote, Computer Age innovation.

In retrospect, this was damn interesting. I was standing at the commenorative plauge we've all seen on field trips and vacation stops. The Industrial Age was taking its last stand against human evolution.

That's why the head office people never said no to me. No needs a reason. Instead, they simply said it was against the rules to say yes. You know—those obscure rules, hidden inside regulations and contracts. They believed in the rules, especially the one against frontline workers deciding on their own tools, and taking out their own garbage, so to speak.

Like anyone, I knew bringing new products to market is hard. I knew sales is difficult. I even knew antagonists exist. But I didn't realize how strongly the Computer Age was being held back. Antagonists masked their self-interest with self-righteous rule-making. In their eyes, I wasn't an innovator helping his society win the game, but just an "uppity extra". Society's upgrades be damned!

I don't want to talk about my experience too much. All that's important is this. There was a huge problem costing millions of dollars, weeks of workers' time (lots of it unpaid overtime), and maybe even your life. And it was against the rules to solve it. Even if I had won this battle for the Computer Age, it would be a tiny victory.

So instead, I'm going to talk about winning the war. Our hospitals, schools, airports, roads, our entire way of life is being held back from the Computer Age by a group of self-entitled holdovers of the Industrial Age.

So I learned my lesson and wrote this book. Because despite already having the digital technology to transform our way of life, antagonists maintain gates all over the place to protect the pre-digital "Woodstock of 1969" way of life. They know—even if subconsciously—they lose their managerial status, executive positions, and superior identities in a Computer Age mass-collaboration economy. Being held back from this brighter future is why our lives are so unhappy. To improve our days then, the people need a new ruling philosophy... one that says improving our society is the only rule that matters.

## To Upgrade Our Civilization We Need To Reach for the Tools

Do you love stories? I think it’s a safe bet to say that you do. Who doesn’t? They entertain us after a hard day of work, bring us together to share our joys, and (my favorite) open our minds to the different rules and philosophies of foreign cities, mythical worlds, and galaxies far, far away.

Stories are so powerful because they’re so simple. Protagonists are good because they want to fix a problem. Antagonists are bad because they don’t. Stories aren’t debates. We take the protagonist’s side. Thus, Romeo and Juliet’s love is beautiful and worth dying for, while their families’ feud is ignorant and stupid. Luke Skywalker’s rebellion is righteous and worth fighting for, while Darth Vader’s empire is wicked and should be destroyed.

Our moral clarity about a problem turns the protagonists into our heroes and the antagonists into our villains. We thus follow their story with strong emotions, which burst out at the climax as we find out who wins.

Our hero fights hard to defeat the bad guys, but his superior morality, justice, and heroism aren’t enough. He’s often too weak or unskilled, and the villain beats him bloody. On the verge of failure, the hero needs to find something that’ll turn the tide in his favor. He seeks, sees, and reaches for his salvation: a tool or a weapon, like a gun, magic book, or lightsaber.

Will our hero reach it first, or will the enemy? We in the audience, like extras in the story, hold our breath because the story’s society is controlled not by desires, opinions, or rules, but by which character holds the tools. The wielder is the victor. The victor writes the rules. It’s the lesson that we the people need to learn for ourselves. Reaching, and holding, the tools is how we stop being extras and start being player gods. Only once we control the tools can we upgrade our civlization to the Computer Age.

## Player Gods Can't Reach for the Tools and Chase Phantoms

We think the rules, regulations, and laws of society control our destiny. They don't. I'll show you why.

Talk to any political junkie, no matter when, and they'll say there's a big election coming up. They'll say something like, "if the red team wins this one, then education, healthcare, infrastructure, and everything else will go to shit." What he means is elections decide the rule-makers, and that blue rules make a good society while red rules make a bad one.

If you buy it—and most of us have at some point—you watch blue cable news, read blue blogs, listen to blue talk radio. You start seeing phantom enemies everywhere because you've filled your head with blue's philosophy. Soon enough, your car has blue bumper stickers, and you're waving blue bristol boards while screaming blue chants at rallies, marches, and protests. You feel like a hero! You're fighting against the evil red philosophy!... Or, if you got sucked in by the other side, evil blue philosophy!

Let me ask you this: if you're a regular middle-class person and you ignored the election, how much would you bet that you would know who won just by continuing to live your life?

When Team Blue wins, does traffic suddenly disappear? When Team Red wins, does everyone suddenly exercise? Do you breathe fresher air or see fitter neighbors? Do your real-life problems get solved when one color's philosophy writes the rules?

Being a believer in red/blue philosophy doesn't change your fate anymore than praying for rain in a 15th century catherdral helped your ancestors on Medieval Main Street eat better. If you'd prefer staying an Industrial Age extra, there's lots of pundits, columnists, and commentators waiting to sing to their choir, telling you to fight "the enemy" until you're literally blue in the face.

If you don't like the choir, or you're starting to realize the "other side" consists of workers like you who are a part of the same struggling middle class, you'd probably like to keep reading. This book will turn you into a player god of the Computer Age.

The first thing to realize is whichever color wins an election this year or the next and re-writes the rules; regular people will still pay taxes, have a huge mortgage, waste hours in traffic, pay increasing energy bills, sleep less than they're supposed to, get confused by their health insurance, earn far less than the CEO, endure customer abuse, get micro-managed, and hope their job (which they likely hate) isn't downsized or outsourced. Under blue or red rules, the middle-class still struggles because our pre-digital Woodstock lifestyle stays the same.

Phantoms aren't to blame. Neither are red/blue laws, regulations, and policies. These can affect our lives, but our tools determine our way of life. Nothing changes or can change between red and blue, because neither Conservatism or Progressivism works to put new tools into the people's hands.

It's not our politicians fault. Red and blue philosophies were created at the start of the Industrial Age. A time when humanity only had a few tools at hand. Red/blue philosophical fathers like Adam Smith, Edmund Burke, John Stuart Mill, and Karl Marx never had running water, listened to music on the radio, made a phone call, opened a fridge, took penicillin, started a motor, typed on a keyboard, or learned about evolution.

Instead, our red/blue philosophical fathers had mud roads, grandfather clocks, and abacus calculators. Doctors of their time prescribed blood-sucking leeches as a medical cure. Being hungry and sick, cold, and ignorant was a way of life back then. Red/blue philosophers dreamed of improving this primitive world with better tools. And, truth be told, they did! These philosophies got our ancestors to agree on the same "big picture"; that they all needed to industrialize society via mass production. Although Left and Right rowed their own oars, they were still on the same boat. Together they heaved and howed society towards economic growth. Soon society upgraded to steam engines, sanitation systems, science labs, telephone networks, broadcast televisions, and computers the size of rooms.

During Industrial Age, the people needed to regulated, and managed inside huge corporations and color-coded parties; someone needed to be on the factory floors and filling the desk jobs using primitive tools to make much better ones. To their credit, the blue and red philosophies at least gave people a voice in how their factories, regulations, and profits were controlled.

Today, however, we live inside the world the Industrial Age dreamed of making. We've grown a massive ecosystem of cities, factories, offices, telecommunications, and layers of infrastructure. The Industrial Age has done its job. It's time to transform the people into into player gods using the digital tools they worked so hard to create. Mass collaboration and economic efficiency is the Computer Age's big picture we should all believe in now.

Happily, we already know how to use digital tools. Although, people often say we're all addicted to our phones. We aren't. Checking news feeds, playing games, flying drones, and taking endless photos are acts of regular people learning to be player gods. Our ancestors did the same the last time they were extras, learning about printed books, telescopes, and muskets. Those were merely addictive toys until new philosophies turned them into the lightsabers that brought down Darth King and the Medieval Age. It was controlling new tools that empowered Main Street to read unknown history, see the universe for themselves, and revolt against royalty. The people became player gods who took responsibility for their civilization.

Just so, we can also stop using our tools as toys and start wielding them as lightsabers to fight for a better way of life. We've just been waiting for a new philosophy to turn them on and bring on the Computer Age. That's Techvolution, a philosophy that turns extras into heroic player gods who are hell-bent on winning the game of civilization.

_Here's a small sample of red/blue cable singing to the choir. This is just like Protestant and Catholics fighting in Europe. The topic of the sermon this time was a campaign speech by Ms. Obama. No surprise, one side hated it, the other loved it. This one clips showcases how petty both political sides are today. It was just a speech. How could it change the world either for better or worse? Since Right and Left ideologues can't make Floatplane, or repair your broken laptop, or make any product you might need, they huddle around like consultants hoping endlessly talking will trick people into keeping the blowhards around. Red/blue can only stay alive by fighting each other. This bullshit only works as long as you listen._

## Once We Believe in a New philosophy, We'll Reach for the Stars

Darth Blockbuster, outdated ideologies, and phantom enemies are not a new story. Once we upgrade to a new age, all three holdovers appear to try and keep us in the old age. The lesson is when upgrading society, we need a new philosophy. Here's one example.

When you look up at the night sky, you see a dazzling show. It can seem to defy explanation. But even with the naked eye, you'll see trends. The stars never move, some "objects" (really planets) look to be wandering, and it looks like the Moon, Sun, and everything else revolves around you. With all these trends, our ancestors were sure Earth was the center of the Universe. So much so, it was a pivotal part of the "Divine Rights of Kings" philosophy that ruled Europe during the Medieval Age (500-1400).

When you look at the night sky with a telescope, like Galileo (1564-1642) did in the Renaissance (1400-1600), you see it differently. Jupiter has moons, Venus has phases, and it looks like Earth is just another planet. When Galileo told everyone these facts, the "divine Catholic and Protestant leaders" were threatened. By using a telescope, Galileo was saying, "we don't know until we test, so let's use instruments to test what we think we know." Scientific inquiry questioned the ruler's divine leadership. Although Catholics and Protestant political leaders hated each other, their worked togeher to suppress Galileo. Neither facilitated the new truths his new tools were discovering.

Galileo is just one example of how new tools bring on a new technological age. And how an establishment finds it very hard to embrace a new era. The lesson is, to enter into a new period, our civilization can't just use new technology. Main Street must welcome a modern philosophy too. Today we're also using an outdated philosophy. Here's an example of how that's hurting our daily lives.

Space travel is a significant step for humanity. It means better satellites, worldwide internet accessibility, and ensuring intelligent life doesn't put all its eggs in our one earthly basket. All possible _if_ we can build an affordable rocket.

Red/blue political culture was unable to deliver an affordable rocket. They can gossip about speeches all day, but rocket science doesn't fit into soundbites. It was private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin (funded by a few rich protagonists) who answered the call. They harnessed digital technology and fostered collaboration to make rockets 10 times cheaper then red/blue politicians were doing. The rocket making newcomers even learned to land their rockets so they can be reused, a monumental achievement that makes space travel even more possible. But many people, especially red/blue politicians, still didn't care. In fact, they often tried to stop these companies by saying they broke the rules.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/TerrificFinishedCaracal' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANv5UfZsvZQ

_This is when SpaceX landed it's second rocket. Enable the sound to really get a feel how important this event was. It was a major step for the Computer Age._

When you're dependent on old philosophies, you're also confined to its old tools and live within its old narratives. Today red/blue politics obsesses over tiny tax cuts, pages of government regulations, and endless media soundbites because their philosophy says they're essential. New and super-powerful technologies like SpaceX are talked about, but more as a novelty act that falls beyond the believers of old philosophies comprehension and comfort zones.

That's the power of philosophy. It filters the definition of good and bad for its followers. Today, red/blue Industrial Age philosophies hold back the incredible, world-changing, happiness granting potential of the Computer Age. Affordable rockets are just one example. Up and down our economy, we use Industrial Age heavy management practices when digital collaboration is far better. The lesson is, once we believe in a philosophy that embraces the Computer Age we'll soar to the stars.

![old philosophy in a new world](/img\diagrams\techvolution-old-philosophy-new-world.png)
_Here’s a screenshot from a my Twitter feed on December 22, 2015, when SpaceX landed its first rocket. At the exact same time, red/blue ideologue Bernie Sanders was ranting about regulation battles with Wall Street. He should have been taking a minute to appreciate all the new solutions SpaceX just opened to humanity. I happened to be following Sanders, so I don’t mean to pick on him. The middle-class needs to stop putting their faith in old philosophies and instead become player gods with tools digital protagonists are giving us today. Like we did when we looked through Galileo telescope generations ago._

## Techvolution is a Fight as Natural as Evolution

Fighting to replace our ruling is a classic human story. It happens every time we start a new technological age. It happened when Galileo fought a religious establishment with a telescope, George Washington fought a political establishment with a musket, Steve Jobs fought an economic establishment with an iPod.

We are embracing this history lesson. Note that this is not a book about how to invent tools. Amazing books like _Rework_ and _Zero to One_ already do that. Nor is this a book about the history of invention; _The Innovators_ does that better than I could dream of doing. If you want brilliant critiques of our society, _The Incerto_ and _The Great Degeneration_ are waiting for you.

This book is about pushing us into the Computer Age with a new philosophy that encourages our evolution. Nature thus inspires Techvolution. Notice that gatekeepers don't exist in our world's ecosystems. Evolution doesn't have anyone telling a cheetah she's running too fast, that the ants are too cooperative, or that a camel is too water-efficient. Individual lifeforms adapt as best they can to their own problems, and the winners survive. There are no middlemen and no gatekeepers, just problem solvers. And the problem solvers live on.

Human biological adaptions take so long, however, that ours have effectively stopped. We'll never biologically evolve to fly, do advanced calculations, or breathe Martian air. Humanity continues life's evolution with tools. We're basically cyborgs who adapt by upgrading our tools to the latest problem in transportation, calculation, and breathing. Hold a spear than a gun, an abacus than a calculator, a plane joystick than a space ship joystick, and you're a different and more powerful cyborg each time.

Nonetheless, our problem solving is held back when gatekeepers of a bygone age hold back civilization's upgrades. This is the equivalent of Blockbuster getting to write rules to keep us renting DVDs instead of saving time and money with YouTube and Netflix; basically, the opposite of evolution.

This classic battle between good and evil fills stories from Greek mythology to Shakespeare. Today the most famous story is Star Wars, so I use it in this book. Star Wars is about a galaxy with an all-powerful energy field called the Force. Luke Skywalker's Jedi warriors' harness "the light side" to help others. Darth Vader's evil Sith lords' harness "the dark side" to help themselves and hurt all who oppose them.

In our world, we like to call our protagonists "trailblazers." Like Jedi knights, they struggle to empower us, cyborgs, with new tools. But we don't have a political name for the antagonists. Gatekeepers are often corrupt, but sometimes gates are good, and often, these people are just doing their job. Thus, I collectively call the antagonists to our technological evolution Darth Blockbuster: people who actively and knowingly prevent human evolution for the sake of their self-interest.

Since biological adaptions and upgrades are evolution, I've called human technological evolution Techvolution. This book is about inventing Techvolution. With Techvolution as a ruling philosophy, regular people are empowered to solve problems with technical upgrades as smoothly in human society as lifeforms do with adaptation and natural selection. Using modern technology to solve their own problems is how extras on Main Street become player gods. Player gods are united by a shared philosphy that empowers them to collaborate and win the game of civilization. In short, techvolution is a fight as natural as evolution.

## Taking an Uber, Learning About Collaboration

Have you ever taken an Uber? If you haven't, it's an smartphone app that connects a person needing a ride, with a person willing to drive them. So say George needs a lift. He opens up Uber and inputs where he needs to go. Uber shows him the "Uber cars" available and the estimated cost of the trip. When George presses "Pick me up", "Jim's car" is assigned to him. George and Jim are connected and can see each others history, rating, vehicle, and GPS location.

Jim drives to George, whose gets in, and Jim drops him off where he needs to go. They can chat or not chat. It doesn't matter. Once there, George gets out. Uber manages the payment. George and Jim rate each other, and then go about their lives.

That's an Uber ride. And if you've ever taken one, you've particpated in Computer Age mass collaboration. Seriously, think about it. George needed to get somewhere; a friends house, job interview, babysitting. Jim helped him get there. And software facilited the collabroation between two strangers.

Once upon a time in the Industrial Age this coordination was done by many managers at taxi, media, and automotive companies. Driver timesheets, dispatch call-centres, complaint resolution, company marketing, vehicle licensing. In the Computer Age, all this paperwork is andled by Uber's (mostly open-source) software. The company Uber still has to staff managers, marketers, executives and what not. But the proportion is far less.

While Darth Taxi-Cab tried to stop Uber in court and government lobbying, it didn't work. The people liked Uber too much. Once people taste it, mass collaboration is too effective to be stopped. And it's just started to grow into more industries. It's something to keep in mind while you're reading this book. Our way of life will get better. Once we become player gods who realize their actions, even if just catching a lift, upgrades their civilization.

## Nice to Meet You, Stargazer

So you got to be a player god. Kind of empowering isn't it. That just like a computer player in _Civilization_ deciding what farm to create, research to conduct, or people to educate, your actions determine the fate of civlizations. Except in real-life you can't restart the game whenever you want. If our civlization fails, we become like ancient Greece, Rome, or Miyans. Simple memories for others to learn from.

That's why, whoever you are, and whereever you are on this Earth, I'm calling you Stargazer. It's a name in honor of our ancestors like Copernicus, Bruno, and Galileo who toppled the Medieval Age because they dared to look up at the night sky, ask questions, and take on the responsibility to advance _their_ civlization. Remember leave the naysayers behind. Let evolution deal with them.

And who am I to tell you all this? I'm nobody special. I haven't led the country, and you haven't seen me on the news. In my youth, I was a cleaner, labourer, movie usher/projectionist, and die-hard ideologue. After dropping the latter bad habit, I studied political philosophy, history, and innovation at the University of Toronto, usually while working full-time. I have a strong dislike for garbage meetings and other excuses people make-up to avoid work. I hate people with superiority complexes, especially when they're in positions of authority and suck at their jobs. That's why I learned far more about innovation by continuing working at the frontline as a line worker, an account manager, and a claims adjuster. Making a new tool and meeting my personal Darth Blockbuster was an education unto itself.

My life's experience began to teach me Techvolution. Watching the middle-class struggle to make a living owning, maintaining, and working with outdated Industrial Age tools—and knowing that the open-source community was meanwhile showing us the way to mass collaboration—ultimately motivated me to sit at the keyboard and uncover their collaboration philosophy so more people can live in the Computer Age. The middle-class deserves to be happy.

But this book is not about me. It's about you. You are in a position where you wield a diversity of incredible and cutting-edge tools, even if you're unaware of it right now. From hospital cleaners to internet technical support, from engineers to claims adjusters, the bottom line is that you are at the frontline. Only workers on the frontline know firsthand the exact tools our society needs to keep us evolving in the Computer Age. The daily pain of real work makes you powerful. A piece of knowledge Darth Blockbuster will never have.

That's why you, Stargazer, are the hero of Techvolution. Don't be surprised. Average Joes and Janes are always the heroes. Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Neo, and Cinderella were all regular people. Heroes aren't born. They're stargazers, dreamers, believers, and achievers. They become heroes when they step up to defeat the bad guys. I'm like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Morpheus, or the fairy godmother, merely a guide to teaching you how to overcome the villains. So, the time is now, Stargazer, to leave the farm and join the rebellion.

The rebellion I speak of might be different than what automatically comes to mind. It is not a physical revolt. It does not involve rallies, marches, or protests. It's a rebellion of the mind. The Computer Age is held back by Darth Blockbuster and his Death Star rule book. That's the reason the middle class is unhappy. Because we feel the Computer Age in our hearts but are forced to live in the Industrial Age in our lives. To earn you're happiness, we need to turn you into a Computer Age player god. But to do that, you have to feel the spark of "eureka!" that makes you realize Computer Age is here, and it's worth fighting for.

## We Build on the Past With Mix Philosophical Politics

The world's on your shoulders Stargazer. But let's take a minute and ease some of the burden. First off, the world is always on your shoulders. Government, "the market", say they're going to be there for you. But maybe they will, maybe they won't. You are always there, so you should always be there for yourself. Being a player god means taking extreme ownership of your life. And this is only hard because it's so easy to watch TV and blame phantoms for your problems. But being a player god is simply realizing your actions are your first and best option for getting a better life.

Exercising, saving for a rainy day, helping a customer understand their loan application, testing your windows for air leaks, buying local farm produce. These are actions of a player god. And they're not that complicated. So while yes being a player god is hard, it's also rather easy. And many of us all are doing it already.

The difference with Techvolution is only that we except ourselves, and each other, to behave more responsibily. And more importantly, we demand the freedom to take responsibility for our home and work lives whenever a Sith Lord says helping our society is against the rules.

But none of this means you, sitting there Stargazer, have to re-invent society. We aren't throwing away any philosophy you may believe in. Old philosophies, Protestant/Catholic, red/blue among them, will always teach us lessons, help us do our jobs better, and enlighten our personal opinions. Today old philosophies should not be our ruling philosophy simply because they weren't created with digital tools in mind.

Let me explain how Techvolution can be our ruling political philosophy by discussing evolution in martial arts.

Humanity has many martial arts: karate, kickboxing, wrestling, jiu-jitsu, judo, and boxing being among the most popular. Each martial art adapts the human body to do specific techniques like punches or choke-holds. Each martial art also makes rules, so only their chosen methods are allowed during competition; there's no kicking in a boxing match, for example.

In the early 1990s, the martial arts community got curious and wondered whose martial art would win a real fight. On reflection, it seems funny that this was an original idea. But before the 1990s, people just assumed boxers or wrestlers could not fight outside their rulebook. All fighters were supposed to be ideologically loyal and sing to their choirs about their techniques being the best. If a fighter got their ass kicked in a real fight, they'd often blame themselves or say the other guy "broke the rules" and "cheated."

The martial art community evolved. They held "no rules" tournaments and were fittingly rewarded with Nature's officially best martial art. The best martial art was none of them; or all of them. Meaning, the best fighters trained all techniques and used the ones they thought would defeat their opponent based on the exact moment they were fighting them. A large toolbox of techniques and an open mind to adapt proved to be the best martial art. Fighters soon embraced adaption and natural selection. This was the start of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA), a new sport that cherishes the evolution mantra "admit defeat and learn." And while boxers still punch the best, and kickboxers kick the best, evolution empowered MMA fighters will almost always beat them in a street fight.

Red/blue ideologies are like non-MMA martial arts. They teach a limited number of techniques, limit themselves to their own rule book, and often think "the other side" is ignorant. Ideologues even accuse non-believers of cheating after losing a debate or election. However, in their area of expertise, monetary policy, farm regulation, labour relations, red/blue have a massive reservoir of know-how. This single book can't replace all that knowledge. It would be laughable to suggest it could.

But we still need a new ruling philosophy. One created from the lessons of evolution and digital tools old philosophies could not factor in. Hence why this book is about making human technological evolution, Techvolution, the most protected political right and responsibility today. There's no other way to enter into the Computer Age.

You can think of Techvolution as "mixed philosophy politics." Under Techvolution, a player god is free to study and believe in old philosophies. Ideals like equality, liberty, equity, lower taxes are all still valid if they motivate you to improve civilization. But no one should let the rule books of old philosophies determine right and wrong when up against a person's right to evolve on the frontline. Because to develop humanity, we the people on the frontline—the people in the real fight—need the freedom to decide which tool best solves a problem. The right to evolve must trump all other considerations.

But we can't give old philosophies, or people whose power and prestige is based on old tools, the right to decide when we upgrade our tools. That is a recipe for staying in the Industrial Age forever. Which is why the middle-class is getting so unhappy. We're getting beat up by relatively simple problems like road traffic, waiting on hold, and confusing loan contracts.

Importantly, since Techvolution is a vital right of the Computer Age, it must also be a responsibility. Here are some projects—big and small—right now that could use some help.

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation recently funded TerraPower. It's a new nuclear reactor design that's much safer. It's a good chance for clean and dependable electricity. Not even Bill and Melinda can fund it all though. Given that the Computer Age runs on electricity, we should be asking ourselves if we should tell our governments too.
  
3D printers are amazing. They can make any small tool imaginable with no shipping, marketing, or retail stores needed. With one machine, anyone can print whatever they need whenever they need it. Sadly, most people have never seen a printer, nevermind bough one of it's products. That should change.

I didn't draw any of this book's illustrations. Instead, I used online tools to connect with illustrators. No job interviews, management oversight, or upfront cost. Collaborating with experts online is that easy. Once we look for it.

The digital ecosystem is larger than the examples above. It'll grow larger still once Main Street starts to push themselves into the Computer Age.

It's in your self-interest to do this. As said before, the Woodstock era is dead. Middle-class people will not get one job for life. We cannot assume "the government" or "the market" will solve all our problems. A "forever Woodstock lifestyle" doesn't exist. Think of this, about 80,000 people worked at Blockbuster, about 5,000 work for Netflix. Why would that automation trend stop for your industry?

In my experience, many people often reply, "won't happen to my job," then go back to watching Netflix. But those are extras. Player gods don't take chances. Digital tools don't threaten us. They're our salvation. When we use them, we can educate ourselves, lower our own cost of living, earn our own income, and, most importantly, collaborate. Can individuals become entirely self-sufficient? Probably not, but we can deal with layoffs, price-gouging, and bad jobs better with a level balance of power.

We're already starting to use digial tools to improve our lives. YouTube product reviews. Wikipedia articles. Cutting off cable and using Netflix. But there's so much more to do. And once the open-source Jedi finally get our support, we'll be spoiled for choices. And regular people wanting to use digital tools is the rebellion inside our mind we need to establish the Computer Age.

In short, Techvolution says, be selfish! You're a lifeform in Nature, don't let anyone hold you back. Demand your freedom! Freedom to speak our minds made the most of the printing press. Freedom to investigate Nature made the most of scientific instruments. Freedom to question royalty made the most of the gun. Freedom to buy products made the most of factories. And the freedom to solve your own real-life problems makes the most of digital tools.

Techvolution starts in your head. While you're watching a political debate, or attending a company meeting, ask yourself, "what's in this for me." Of course, red/blue politicians won't talk about a direct democracy app, and I don't want you to tell your boss to go to hell and quit your job. But we first enter into a new age in our mind. As you keep asking "what's in this for me," you'll seek out new digital tools. When you hold new tools, you hold political power. And holding power is how extras become player gods.

That's why controlling tools is the Nature of all political battles. Whether in galaxies far far away, street fights in parking lots, wars between nations, or your own life. It's why antagonists make new tools against the rules. And why I needed to write a book to remind everyone philosophies and rules are supposed to serve human evolution, not get in its way. But since there are so many rules stalling the Computer Age upgrade Stargazer, we must pack our bags, rally our friends, and get ready for a fight. It's time to blow up a Death Star.

_This is politics. A regular person using a modern tool to find where he can improve his civilization. Will he upgrade his windows, recaulk them, or spray in some insulation. Asking how to improve something is a worthy political debate. Not complaining about energy prices and climate change on Twitter. Which person would you want in your society if you were society's player god?  And once we've done our daily work, we can play basketball, watch a movie, or whatever else we want. Just don't chase phantom communists or fascists. You're better off sealing that drafty window._

# ACT TWO - BLOWING UP THE DEATH STAR

## When Rules Are In Our way, We Use Evolution to Defeat Them

Life's been evolving for billions of years. Humanity continues life's evolution by creating technology. We develop new and better tools in stages like the Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Industrial Age. Unfortunately, transitioning between stages is hard. Human nature being what it is, the powers of the old age hold back the modern era. Since we've entered the Computer Age in 1970, Darth Blockbuster has continuously defended his mechanical tools by making digital tools against the rules.

Some examples. In the 1970s, AT&T defended its mechanical telephone system monopoly by successfully lobbying the American government to ban internet modems. In 1984, the broadcast television industry tried to ban video cassette recorders (VCRs) and only lost by one vote in the Supreme Court. In 2001, the music industry defended compact discs (CDs) by successfully suing Napster for giving people digital songs. Likewise, Tesla, Uber, SpaceX, Airbnb's most significant competition has been in the courtroom. Throughout society, antagonists have found rules to keep people using mechanical Industrial Age tools.

This seemingly endless list of rules is the Death Star. This antagonism is why life on Main Street is getting worse. But before you face Darth Blockbuster and blow up his Death Star, Stargazer, you must learn what weapons you have at your disposal. The most formidable? The all-powerful energy field inside every lifeform. No, not the Force. I'm talking about evolution.

## The Magic of Evolution - How Evolution Works

Evolution is life's secret weapon. It empowers life by giving every new lifeform a slightly different variation. With variations, life can continually test for environmental changes in things like water levels, temperature, and food supply. The variations that can't make it die off, and the fittest survive. This natural selection helps life find which lifeforms are best adapted to survive on Earth.

Evolution works so well because it creates biodiversity. Biodiveristy means there are more lifeforms probing the environment for changes. The more lifeforms feel the pain of environment changes, the sooner life can adapt a solution to the frontline problem.

When the biodiversity is high enough, evolution creates an ecosystem. Ecosystems can be described as a "circle of life" food chain. Many plants, herbivores, carnivores, and decomposers, work to harvest resources. Grass turns light, water, nutrients, into biomass, eaten by the grazer, which feeds the predator. When everything dies, it returns all the nutrients back into the soil for the grass to keep growing. Each lifeform checks the other to be sure no one hoards or freeloads. Few of these lifeforms could exist alone. Ecosystems are a place where lifeforms collaborate.

Evolution may not be the Force, but it's positively magical. In tune with Nature's own special rhyme and reason, evolution turned a lifeless planet into an oasis of many different ecosystems. The big drawback is time. Biological variations can take millions of years to respond to environmental changes. Think of the poor polar bears. They'll never understand why Arctic ice isn't reforming as massively each year. And even if they could, no lifeform can proactively change their biology.

In contrast, humanity can change—not our biology, but our "cyborgology," if you will (and hopefully in time to help the polar bears). We have the power to feel frontline pain, reflect on the problems causing it, and create a new tool to overcome the problem.

Techvolution is, therefore, intentional evolution. It's a more advanced and quicker form of evolution that isn't a magical mystery, as natural evolution is to polar bears, but is instead something we can understand. The question is, what drives us to evolve when Darth Blockbuster's Death Star often says it's wrong?

## The Majic of Techvolution - How human techvolution works

We call someone a _genius_ when he or she uses existing technology to make a new tool. Happily, these trailblazers are self-motivated, and we already celebrate their intellect and innovations. But innovation isn't the only step toward Techvolution. We only truly evolve when the extras choose to use a new tool.

For example, think of computers. Before they could change the world, people needed to use them. To use a computer means learning how to type. And typing is a skill. In fact when stuffy Xerox execs saw the world's first personal computer, the Xerox Alto, they refused to use it because "typing was women's work." (Unsurpringly, many of the Alto engineers soon went to Apple and helped them make the MacIntosh). The point is, if everyone people refused to learn typing, computers would be useless. Only when individuals decide to learn how to use a tool, and integrate it into their lifestyles, does society upgrade.

So, what trick does Nature play on extras to reach for new tools when so often would be risking Darth Blockbuster's wrath? The answer is a force found within us all.

Unlike evolution, the trick is not actually akin to magic because we humans understand we're dropping one tool and familiarizing ourselves with another, like when swapping out the DVD player for Netflix. Yet there's still something wonderfully mystical about choosing to leave one's comfort zone to learn a new cyborgolgy. I call it majic; it's pronounced like magic, but spelled differently to note the critical difference to its homonym: it's the free choice of a regular person to proactively and intentionally evolve, even if they don't fully understand how they're upgrading civilization. Majic encompasses our yearning to explore, to learn, to grow, to live to our fullest potential, all of which require new tools to empower us to make real the dreams that exist in our minds. It's the first step to a new technological age.

Typically, we underappreciate how cool it is to learn new tools. But every time we try, we're like a drowning desert fox wearing fins and goggles, yelling out, "I'm getting better!" as he flounders in the water. Pushing our boundaries is what life is all about. It's majic that keeps us jumping back into the water and out of our comfort zone.

Techvolution is the ruling philosophy that encourages extras to "majically" bond with any tool they want so they can solve frontline problems as player gods. Yet what do we do when the Death Star says it's wrong?

**Majic**: The natural inclination of a person to learn, use, and hold new tools to increase their natural abilities.

DARWIN'S FINCHES
Charles Darwin discovered evolution. He visited an island chain, where each island had different climate. Darwin noticed the same bird was slightly different on each island. He then noticed each's beek was adapted to each a different good. Bugs, seeds, or nuts. Humanity mimicks evolution by inventing, and using new tools. Since we can drop and pick up tools, we can evolve so much faster than other lifeforms.

- Note: Majić is my family name. I lucked out because it reads like "magic" in English. It may seem egotistical to coin it as a term here, but I couldn't think of a better work. Primarily, the use of "majic" pays tribute to my parents. If you've liked this book so far, you'll know why.

- Sticking it to my personal Darth Blockbuster makes me smile too.

## Using Majic to Filter the Rules - How to tell the good from the bad rules

Despite our problems with our current philosophy, society always needs one philosophy that reigns above the rest. We use it to create the ground rules that glue us all together. Without a ruling philosophy, the story of mankind would be a story of chaos. There would be no such thing as civilization.

Darth Blockbuster fights to control the ruling philosophy. When he succeeds, he writes rules to keep the tools he commands, and therefore himself, in power. Corporate manuals, university guidelines, social justice blogs are among the pages of his Death Star rule book fighting off the Computer Age. These rules interfere with regular people's majically bonding with new tools. But how can you tell if a rule is good or bad? How can you pinpoint a rule book as a Death Star? Darth Blockbuster doesn't tell people he's Darth Blockbuster. Instead, he says he's The Executive or The Prince. Are these people genuine authority figures in the story of civilization, or Darth Blockbusters protecting their paychecks?

It's essential to filter out the good from the bad rules throughout our everyday lives. It takes practice, and it demands cultivating our integrity and inner truths. Yet it's a struggle that's been taking place for centuries. As an example, you needn't look further than this story of a Maryland farm boy named Frederick, who was born approximately two centuries ago.

===

Our story is about a Maryland farm boy named Frederick using tools to overcome ignorance. His farm is one of those you might have seen on shows like _Little House on the Prairie_. Salt of the earth farmers raising crops and families in 19th century rural America. No internet, no school systems, no much to learn but how to survive with your hands and the fortune God gave you.

Frederick worked the fields with his mother. It was hard labor of course, there weren’t many machines around, so he had to work hard, for himself and his mother.

In a few years, Frederick was sent to work with a relative in Baltimore. The house was large and the young family could use a help cleaning, shopping, doing chores. It made his mother happy he wouldn’t sweat so much, yet Frederick was a farmer and unsure of the big city.

The patriarch of the house was named Hugh. He wasn’t around much. His new wife Sophia was. She was a foreigner used to colder climates who didn’t know many people yet, so she stayed in a lot. Sophia was nice and treated Frederick nicely too. Not as a farmer, but as an interesting person. She made Frederick feel at ease.

One day, Sophia handed Frederick a list of items to pick up from the store. Frederick’s eyes looked down, his shoulders slouched, like a dog who disappointed its masters. Frederick mumbled "I can’t read".

"My God, well that won’t do!" Sophia responded, then continued "Reading is good. How else can a person give and receive information from... from... the world! I’ll teach you; we’ll do it together". So, Sophia taught Frederick to read. Just a few weeks, and he got the basics. Sophia performed majic and was overjoyed.

Frederick even more so! Finally, all those markings in the store, on street corners, in books, in newspapers, in the Holy Bible, mean something, a new world! Go left, turn right, open, closed, discounted, welcome, and Salvation, all words that open a new world.

Now Frederick danced to the store, he whisked himself to do his chores, because he was learning to read a little more every day. He loved how the world kept getting bigger, and information kept pouring in.

One day Hugh came home early. He saw Sophia and Frederick reading at the dinner table. Hugh walked into the room. "Boy, get out, and wait in the hallway. Face the wall".

Frederick got out, went outside, and faced the wall. Seconds turned to minutes. Frederick rolled the newspaper in his hands tighter. He didn’t want to go back to the farm. But even more, he didn’t want his angel to get in trouble.

Inside the room, Sophia was curious "What is it?". Hugh responded "This isn’t Ohio... Darling you can’t do that. We could get in a lot of trouble. You can’t teach them to read".

Sophia responded "everyone learns to read in Ohio".

Hugh takes a seat. "This isn’t a free State. He is a slave. What do you think happens when slaves read? Don’t you think they’ll start thinking?" Sophia’s eyes went wide. Hugh continued "It’s against the rules to teach a slave to read... now teach the boy".

As Frederick heard the hallway door open, he straightens up, and grips his newspaper.

Sophia says "Turn around".

Frederick does, and looks at his angel, the one who talked with him like he was a person. And she looked back and only saw _her boy_.

Sophia slapped the newspaper from her boy’s hand. He didn’t let go. She slapped again, and again and again. Each slap hurt more than a dozen whips on his scarred back.

She slapped, and slapped, and slapped, and slapped. Sophia was told her society's philosophy and it "clicked" for her. Now she knows what evil is and she will not do it. Sophia then and there became a demon protector of vile racism to justify human slavery.

Frederick’s world shutdown again. The one white person ignorant enough to treat him like a person, was now an educated convert to the rules that put him into chains. Physical chains if needed, but evil prefers mental chains of ignorance; they stay on so much easier.

Weeks later Frederick was still in despair. His daily routine was the same. Yet, working under demonic masters is just different. He didn’t dance to the store, he didn’t whisk to do his chores, and he never saw Sophia smile again. Demons are always unhappy because they're always on guard.

One day while doing his chores, Frederick saw a newspaper, the avenue to knowledge whose path Frederick was once on. He looked at the markings, saw some words he knew, and one word he didn’t. Yet he still stared at it. Why?

The answer slapped him harder than the demon ever did, he read the words "The Free States in the North". He heard the word freedom before, but he didn’t know freedom was a real place.

A shockwave went through him when he realized if slavery was a place, then so must freedom be a place too. Frederick realized he could break chains! Because ignorance was always his demon, and knowledge was always his angel. And he fought ignorance, and received knowledge, whenever he read.

So, Frederick taught himself to read. He practiced with ignorant white kids on the streets. He practiced reading items at the grocery store. He practiced on every street sign. And he practiced every time he was at the Baltimore dock; the dock I said, you know the place, where ships will take you anywhere in the world. If you can read the schedule.

One day Sophia waited for her boy to return. But the boy died when the man Frederick Douglass walked onto the ship headed north to freedom. The man knew the exact time, place, and fare he needed to get on. He read it, himself, on the schedule. Reading opened the world to Frederick, and now the free world was opened to him.

The story gets better. Frederick Douglass becomes a brilliant orator and writer. In a world with no radio, video, or telephones, he travels the Northern States and Europe telling everyone the truth about slavery. When the American Civil War (1861-1865) broke out, his books helped Britain reject recognizing the South, and thus deprived it of much needed support. The irony of a slave educating people about slavery, and thereby helping to end slavery, is the cherry on top of this great story.

DOUGLASS PICTURE/DIAGRAM
_This is a diagram of the story. A technology comes with a philosophy. And each philosophy has its protagonists, antangonists, and extras. Sophia had a choice. We'll find out below why she choose wrong._

===

Frederick Douglass was a true Jedi Master. His exceptional bravery, persistence, and intelligence helped to showcase humanity's endless potential. He became an individual player god, and swayed the entire player god to upgrade society's entire philosophy against vile racism. The big lesson we learn from Douglass Stargazer, is how to use majic to tell the difference between good and evil rules.

Sophia taught Douglass to read. She wasn't told to. She did it because we love teaching our chosen tools, whether they're soccer balls, new apps, or how to tape drywall. It's as natural to spread our tools, as it is for a species to propagate.

Teaching and learning are significant because it's the moment of creation. When a magician makes a playing card disappear, we smile in awe and childish wonder. That's cool, but nothing new was created, so we soon lose our joy. However, when a majician connects someone with typing, building, or reading, they've similarly performed something awesome. Still, it's not a temporary trick to be enjoyed at the moment. They've upgraded someone's cyborgology and effectively created a new and improved person. This makes us smile for a long time. Creation is majic, majic is an upgrade, and an upgrade is Nature's long-lasting dopamine fix.

Yet human-made rules _sometimes_ say upgrading to a new tool is wrong. Upgrades aren't "allowed"—and this decree may be issued either directly or indirectly. Medieval parishioners couldn't read a science book, French peasant farmers couldn't have a musket, a 1990's kid couldn't download a digital song. Today millions of tired mothers can't telecommute.

Rather... the tired mothers can, they all have high-speed internet and home computers, but they don't.

The question is: why not?

There is no easy answer. Remember in no story does anyone ever say they're evil. Society's rule book will never call itself a Death Star. The lesson Stargazer is it'll never be easy to know the difference between good and bad rules. Anyone can proclaim rules. Even kids on the playground can say "only tall kids can play" and others, based on personality, will obey or not.

Majic is thus our best judge of the rules. Majic feels right. It naturally makes us smile. It improves us and our way of life. From teaching a kid to walk to teaching a grandmother to "Skype in" and watch her grandkid's first steps, teaching and learning new tools open our hearts because it turns us into player gods who work to improve ourselves and our civilization.

So, when you're teaching or learning a new tool and someone steps in your way with a rule, ask yourself if you feel wonderfully inspiring majic, and if you do, ask the rule maker why he doesn't. Perhaps there's a good reason. But keep Sophia in mind. Performing majic made her feel good while following the rules only made her feel safe. The Death Star operates by fear.

Safety is fleeting Stargazer. Human rules are created by hierarchies, which topple with every new technological age. Thus all rule books eventually expire. Majic never will. It always was, and always will be, in our souls. It's how we naturally test our rule book. Electricity, the microchip, the iPhone were all made by people who broke the rules. Yet we celebrate their innovators Nikola Tesla, Jay Last, Steve Jobs because they invented new tools that let us feel and spread majic today.

Ignore majic at your peril. Look at Sophia, she gave one of our greatest writers and orators his start. Yet she lived a miserable life watching him achieve greatness because she broke the rules. Unhappiness is the inevitable punishment to everyone who ignores the joy of learning, or helping others learn, new skills and tools.

It's a lesson for us to take in when we're stuck in traffic, getting the gears from eight different bosses, or doing whatever else is giving us such unhappy lives. We're unhappy because we're not learning the new skills and tools of the Computer Age. Which is why we need a new philosophy that says, holding back majic is wrong.

_This guy's learning new skils. And he's so happy doing it. He's another YouTuber whose channel is about learning new skills. His videos go along way to explaining why we aren't happy. We don't get to learn stuff because our workplaces still think it's the Industrial Age. A time when we manned the machines of mass production. But we're in the Computer Age now, which means we all have to learn new tools whilst improving things on the frontline in an era of mass collaboration. If someone doesn't feel this majic, it's a good sign they're the one with the problem._

## Now We Know the Difference Between Good and Bad, It's Time to Use It

Stargazer, you're not Frederick Douglass. You're not enslaved. You're not beaten. You're life is better than his. But that doesn't mean we're happy with our lives anymore than Douglass was content with his personal freedom. Our society needs player gods to solve today's problems. So you have the same job as Douglass had when he got his free. You have to spread it to others. That means you have to follow majic, become a player god, and evolve humanity past Darth Blockbuster and into the Computer Age.

Thankfully, we've already been doing it. We'll read how we won a battle in the story below. Once we understand how it's done, we'll be that much closer to winning the war and blowing up the Death Star.

## Inventing The Future Adaptations - Because We Know the Difference Between Majic and Rules, We Can Adapt Faster

We've upgraded from one age to the next many times. There is a trend in the transformation. It follows biological evolution, where there are continual adaptations of existing lifeforms, and then sometimes fully new lifeforms. Likewise in Techvolution this is the difference between upgraded technology, and an entirely new tool.

Upgrading a technology, such as going from sedan’s to SUV’s, VHS to DVD’s, tube TV’s to LCD’s, is an iterative change. Each product is different technologically, but they do the same job, so no new majic is needed to attract users. As a result, there's no political battles with any antagonists.

But when we’ve upgraded enough technologies, like microchips, touchscreens, batteries, and Wi-Fi, a genius can unlock a new tool like smartphones. And this requires new skills to learn, thus new majic to attract people to learn the new tool, and this is a big deal.

![New Tool Creation](/img\diagrams\techvolution-new-tool-creation-pc-s.png)
_New technology is continually invented. When enough separate technology is invented, a new tools is created._

Because creating a new tool asks a climactic and political question: who controls it? After all, whoever does, is more powerful. The weilder of the new tool can let people connect with it to solve their problems. Or withold it and force or convince people to keep using old tools. Like muscle cars trying to keep customers away from Tesla with techniques like mass advertising, fancy auto shows, and spectacular chromes platedd V8 power! Because of how anti-evolutionary these these techniques are, I call them "dark majic".

Thus, while the story of civilization is the struggle to overcome problems by upgrading technology and inventing new tools, it’s also about the battle to control them. Unfortunately, it is entirely natural the people with the old tool fight to retain their power, while inventors and innovators imagine a new society that shares it.

Today the people lack self-awareness. Too many are extras watchingthe battle. When they step up, the people player gods who decide what society will do. I’ll show you Stargazer, how important you are. Not too long ago, it was you who invented and implemented a new tool just by being curious and loving majic.

**Dark Majic**: Methods and techniques to keep a person using a tool for the benefit of the tool's controller and not the user.

## Calling Dark Majic

Car commericials are everywhere. And they're a great example of old industries spicing up an old tools. Here's a cool story. I've processed about 10,000 car accident insurance claims. When I'd ask about the caller's vehicle color, brand, etc. I'd usually get told stuff like "it's epic midnight silver with the special edition package", and "it's a SUV, a BMW SUV, please don't call it a car". Sometimes I'd play stupid and have fun by asking "are you sure it was epic morning silver?". To which people usually responded "no I'm quite sure it was the midnight".

The real funny part was when I'd ask "what was the other guy driving?" and nine time out of 10, I'd hear "you know what, I don't know.". Not like they don't know the bullshit marketing color. "Do you know the make, model, if it was a SUV or a pickup truck, a sedan or a crossover?" And still, people didn't know. When a person hit a horse, they'd remember it was a horse. But a car? None would stand out. That's dark majic.

Many people buy cars and see themselves as being standouts. Yet nobody else on the road cares. Because all cars are basically the same. Darth Blockbuster splurges on marketing because the fact is your the same cyborg you before and after you buy a new car. Because I guarantee you when someone's car was damanged, they wanted any car rental ASAP. Fancy features and made up colors didn't matter. Because going from A to B, is all the car did for them. Darth Blockbuster splurges on marketing because he's not an engineer, designer, mechanic, or factory worker. It also helps huge marketing budeget gets him paid.

# MID POINT

## A Techvolution Battle Scene. Wikipedia vs. Books. Computer Age vs. Industrial Age

The environment keeps changing. Life needs to know how and uses its lifeforms to probe for answers. Similarly, the human environment keeps changing, and so humans also have to probe for answers. We ask questions like why are the movies so expensive, or more importantly what are proven techniques to stop malaria infections. We find answers by creating a reference tool.

Our first reference tool was the wisdom of our elders. The first technological upgrades were papyrus scrolls and ink (around 2300 BC) and books (around 300 BC), which turned some elders into experts like Hippocrates and Aristotle. When wood-pulp paper (1200) and the printing press (1456) were invented, humanity unleashed mass-produced books. Now experts could share knowledge between themselves and educate the masses. We called the reference books encyclopedias.

Encyclopedias were a massive hit; up until a generation or so ago, many households proudly included a physical encyclopedia collection in their library. _The Encyclopedia Britannica_ (1878) was the standard. In 1933 it started to be re-publihsed every to keep people updated to the latest facts. When the Computer Age hit in the 1970's, home computers, digital printers, and telecommunications meant encyclopedias were written and stored digitally. But they remained a set of printed books and CD’s controlled by experts.

Then came the world wide web (1991). A new technology that brought the Computer Age to the Main Street. The web unlocked many new tools like websites, forums, blogs, and something called "wikis". Wiki software lets anyone write or edit a webpage by pressing "edit now". All changes are saved, so anyone can erase errors or vandalism by pressing "undo now". For years programmers used wikis to collaboratively write technical manuals.

As web tools boomed in the late ’90’s, protagonist Jimmy Wales wondered if the web could upgrade encyclopedias. Today, most of us who were curious about things like the movies or malaria know this story ends with a free online encyclopedia anyone can edit called Wikipedia. Wikipedia being the poster child for the era of mass collaboration. But it didn’t start out that way.

Wikipedia started as Nupedia (2000). Nupedia was a free online copycat of Encyclopedia Britannica. It followed the Industrial Age rationale of making gates. It said only "expert" professors were qualified to write articles. Wikipedia (2001) was a side project. Only the programmers, designers, innovators of the Computer Age knew mass collaboration was the way of the future.

Everyone else didn't realize that with a new technological age, comes a new philosophy as well. The first signs of a problem was that the professors didn’t like to share their knowledge. In its first year, Nupedia had 12 articles. Wikipedia had 40,000, which most professors loved to belittle as rubbish. Professors even went further amd disallowed students from referencing Wikipedia’s articles in their school work. Yet professors refused to improve, or to assign students to improve, Wikipedia. The professors went beyond antagonism and even performed dark majic. They tried, and still try, to convince people to not use Wikipedia. They'd prefer students pay to compete for grades, and getting published in "elite" academic journals.

The second sign of a problem with Industrial Age think was that it turned out "expert" answers and "regular" answers are the same. The movies are expensive because of a 1948 government rule banning studio’s working with theatres (which means they can't collaborate to lower prices). And mosquito nets are a simple and effective tool against malaria infections. Wikipedia let the collective knowledge of the people be recorded. And everyone is an expert at something.

And that's the essence the Computer Age, Techvolution, and the era of mass collaboration. Wikipedia was so easy to use many extras became player gods! A huge community of non-academics voluntarily shared their knowledge one "edit now" at a time and fiercely protected their common knowledge with "undo now". Nobody told them, paid them, or made a rule to force it. Because performing majic by writing or reading a Wikipedia article, is Nature’s dopamine rush.

Wikipedia is Computer Age technology merged with Techvolution. It makes complete sense Wikipedia became king, while Nupedia and Encyclopedia Britannica quickly died. Even though antagonists tried to stop it, notice how easily digital tools win when the peple are free to choose what tools best solve their problem. Another reason Techvolution should be our ruling philosophy.

That’s the story of Wikipedia. Made by new protagonists, made the standard reference tool by player gods. Few believed it was possible, because even professors don’t understand new tools always unpower the few, to empower the rest. Interestingly, after I finally conceded temporary defeat to my personal Darth Blockbuster, I uploaded a few pages to Wikipedia instead. Not as helpful as my app, but it took just a few weeks of work, and one "edit now" button, to make it real. It felt majical to bypass the rules. It also put a big smile on my face.

## We've Won an Upgrade Battle, Now Here's How We've Won the War Before

So that's how we won a battle in the fight for the Computer Age. It's a battle that made me, and everyone else who write and read Wikipedia happy. Because evolving humanity puts smiles on our faces. The frequent excuses and rules in the way of evolution are made by those who benefit from old tools, who perform dark majic to convince other people to keep using old tools that keep them in power and rich.

Wikipedia’s victory teaches us to win the war to upgrade to the Computer Age. Imagine when Main Street does what it did with Wikipedia, and mixed digital tools and mass collaboration to solve agonizing commutes, confusing loan contracts, rising home energy bills. Stargazer, that’s war you must jump into with lightsabers a-blazin’, dicing up old evil storm-trooping tools, to supercharge humanity into the Computer Age.

Note however, our lives cut across thousands to millions of problems. Thus, our villains are not in a massive group like "the rich" or the "the unions" as old philosophies label. Our villains reveal themselves inside thousands of companies, institutions, and organizations of the Industrial Age who fight to keep their version of the Encyclopedia Britannica or DVD alive.

This is the entire class of middle-men, consultants, managers, and executives who don't know the skills of their industry like nursing, teaching, and (definitely not) cleaning. Their power is to manage the gates of an Industrial Age technology. And to keep us competing to be included in their heirarchy.

Together, protagonists and extras can overcome these Darth Blockbusters to bring on the Computer Age. I know this is possible because history has proven it. Our struggle to upgrade our civlization was fought generations ago with Darth Blockbuster’s master: Darth King.

Darth King ruled a top a heirarchy. He lived inside palaces, using society’s money to host splendid banquets and balls. His absolute power was hidden inside the Medieval Age's ruling philosophy of the nobility’s "divine right" to rule. Slowly, as protagonists invented scientific instruments, books, and guns, the Age of Enlightnment was born. With it came a new philosophy that valued science, equality, and democracy. It was made the ruling philosophy when Main Street became player gods in the American and French Revolutions. These revolutionaries were inspired by the new philosophy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

![Battle Scene](/img\diagrams\techvolution-battle.png)

## Freeing Rousseau's Cinderella By Defeating Another Sith Lord, Darth King

"Player gods are born free; and everywhere they are tricked to be extras". Rousseau said that in 1762. Actually, he didn’t. He said "people are born free and everywhere they are in chains". It's the same idea both times. Rousseau was neither the king of France nor the richest man in England. Instead, he was a poor writer who copied sheets of music to make the rent. More than 300 years later, he is at last recognized as being a great philosopher, a political visionary, and a protagonist who helped free the world with his new philosophy.

Rousseau lived when kings and queens, dukes and duchesses ruled civilization. A time when Mozart played inside exquisite palaces during the nobility’s many banquets and balls. This was the opulence that had Cinderella dreaming her days away as she cleaned a dirty chateau. Sadly, unlike the fairy tale, the people didn’t have a fairy Godmother to make their dreams come true. Instead, the commoners cleaned the nobles’ vast libraries, used guns while dying in their wars, and were told to ignore what scientific instruments revealed. As extras in the story, they were excluded from the power of new tools because they believed they lost the competition. Only Darth King had the "divine right to rule". The people believed their beloved Holy Bible said so.

Rousseau called bullshit. In truth, Jesus was a carpenter, a commoner just like any other person. Who is anyone to say extras can’t live up to their own potential as player gods? Turning extras into player gods is how Rousseau fought for the Age of Enlightenment. He believed that books, guns, and scientific instruments should liberate the extras who were only in chains for the happiness of con artists. The self-proclaimed "divine nobility" didn’t like hearing that. This powerful self-protecting community declared Rousseau a banquet-pooper, and chased him out of Switzerland, France, and England. Maybe that’s why Rousseau rented instead of owned.

It didn't matter. The nobility were in the dying days of their Mediavel Age ruling philosophy. Starting in 1776, within Rousseau’s lifetime, Darth King started to face the music when the American people started a revolution. One year after Rousseau died, the French had their own revolution in 1789. And on it went from country to country because Rousseau, and others like him, made the extras realize they should become player gods with an Age of Enlightenment ruling philosophy "of the people, for the people, by the people". Cinderella soon forgot about the fancy ball, and instead sung the music of freedom in a choir of equals, that sounded something like this:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/47E2tfK5QAg?start=5" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Revolutionary songs like this spread the people’s liberty, equality, and fraternity throughout the world. In a few years, the Medieval Age was finally gone, and civilization embraced the Age of Enlightenment with a new ruling philosophy of Democracy. Now the nobles were no longer divine, but villains who resorted to hiring mercenaries to suppress the player gods on Main Street. The banquet loving nobles failed to realize that "their" people didn’t need them anymore.

When the people took control of books, guns, and science, they collaborted to run a safe society that didn't need to oppress the people. Main Street put presidents and senators, judges and sheriffs in power, who ruled at the request of the people. The people became player gods who contributed to their own civilization inside rotary clubs, quilting societies, and other civil organizations that was a check and balance on the leaders, because no one was divine. A change empowered by tools, thought of in philosophy, yet made real with the bloodshed of revolutions on the frontline.

Rousseau died never having found a home. After they won their revolutions, a population of player gods put him to rest inside the glorious Panthéon, heralding him as a renowned breaker of chains, in a world of Enlightenment he helped build. Where any guy can be the prince, and any girl can be Cinderella.

The question for us is, how did Rousseau help an entire people embrace a new age, and change their ruling philosophy? I'd especially like to know how we do it better, because I’d really like to skip horrible wars and revolutions as we venture into the Computer Age.

## Society’s Three Stories Help Tell Us Our Place in the Story of Civilization

Entering a new age doesn't require an actual war. But conflict usually brings down the old age and rings in the new. To avoid it while entering the Computer Age, we have to see our society better than Rousseau did. We can do that because we can learn from him.

Rousseau’s words echo this sentiment: let society enter into the Age of Enlightenment. Let the people prosper with new tools. Let the nobility return to their natural equality inside a democracy where anyone is free to be the the ruler if they can solve problems and thereby earn the public's approval and consent. Rousseau never said there shouldn't be leaders. He said leaders should earn their spot.

He didn't phrase it like this, of course, but that's what Rousseau basically said. Once we accept society transitions through technological which also get a new philosophy, we accept society as gets new leaders. Rousseau showed us how we can transition to new leaders using stories. It shouldn’t come as a big surprise that he was also a novelist.

Thus, Rousseau understood stories—not just fictional ones, but real-world ones, best explained the fabrication and inner workings of any society. He understood, too, that there are good and bad stories. And that each stems from a storyteller who has a very particular purpose. These stories are especially appealing to Main Street. And for that you really should sit up and pay attention here. Learning about stories will help you understand your own reality.

So let's explain stories. Every story contains a plot: a sequence of events where a protagonist fights an antagonist to overcome a problem. The fight to change reality happens in three parts. The first is the introduction of the problem and characters. The second is protagonist and antagonist thinking up plans and attacking each other. The third part is the conclusion, where we find out which side wins. Although it’s easier to see in some more than in others, all stories have this structure.

The difference between good and bad stories is how much it mixes things up to keep you in guessing what's going to happen next. While some bad stories are non-stop action scenes, and some stories are non-stop talking scenes, good stories mix the two up to tell a logical and surprisng story with a thick plot. Here are the three different kinds of stories.

===

**Classic movies:** are good stories with fights about real-life problems. A protagonist leaves their typical day, changes their personality, and rises to the occasion to overcome a new found problem on behalf of humanity. Antagonists of course fight back.

In a classic story, protagonist and antagonist repeatedly think of new ideas and act on them. Usually this means both characters fight to create and control tools like magic books, secret plans, or a big bomb.

Mixing logical problem solving, with new ideas, gives classic stories plot twists that keep audiences glued to their seats. No one knows if the good or bad guys will win. This is why good stories have a "thick plot". It's so hard to guess what's going to happen next.

There’s no way to know which stories will resonate with audiences, but only classic stories can resonate with audiences and become archetypes like _Cinderella_, _Romeo and Juliette_, _The Matrix_, and _Star Wars_. These stories are tales like "Rags to Riches" or "Forbidden Love" that exist in all cultures and religions in some way.

**Art films:**- are not about any specific problem. The main character doesn't challenge themselves, or rise to the occasion. The art story is more of a personal journal about not overcoming problems, for example being lonely, or hating ones job. The main character is thus selfish and self-important. Not because they do not take on a problem, but because they want to be the protagonist even though they aren't leading the way for others to follow.

The result is stories with no storyline and no antagonist. Instead, art stories showcase their main characters idiosyncratic behavior like collecting action figures, or wandering around a shopping centre. Stories are surprising to the point of being weird, with conclusion that never change the reality because the main character didn’t even try to.

Without logical surprises, art films need to get weirder and weirder to maintain interest. To insulate themselves from criticism art filmmakers usually give themselves awards, grandeur, and titles and end up-like their main characters-on stages talking about themselves in a bout of self-gratification. Film festivals like Cannes, Sundance, Toronto mainly show art films.

**Spectacle movies:**- are about an obvious problem, i.e. Godzilla is here, so run like hell and keep running until the movie is over. Spectacle movies are thus very simple because the problem is very simple; survive or die. However, since the action is so instinctual, there’s no time for the protagonist to think of new ideas. The result is logical but unsurprising stories.

To maintain interest, spectacle movies have to keep reusing old stories and characters while ramping up special effects, gore, and raunchiness. It doesn’t work for too long, so spectacle producers look for new customers with hype-filled mass marketing campaigns. Most franchise movies, sequels, and remakes are spectacle movies.

===

These are the three story categories in a nutshell. Classic stories tackle real-life problems. Art stories are self-obsessed. Spectacle stories are a distraction. This is why art/spectacle stories don’t have "spoilers", while we want to "go in fresh" for classic stories.

You can see the difference in your favorite sitcom; such as _The Office, Seinfeld, Friends, HIMYM, The Big Bang Theory_. They start off as classic stories, with characters who deal with relatable problems like not liking their jobs or being tired of dating. We see ourselves in these characters, which is why we cry, laugh, and all that. We responded to stories about regular everyday life, because we know it could also happen to us too.

However, in later seasons, to keep their now popular characters alive, the sitcoms keep them living the same stories. Kramer can’t get a job, Raj can’t get a girl, Dwight can’t get self-aware. Here sitcoms become art and spectacle stories. Art, as in these characters don't overcome their personal problems. And, spectacle, because we the audience keep watching our favorite actors, characters, sets, catch-phrases, instead of wanting a new story.

Rousseau noticed society has these classic, art, and spectacle stories, and that our societies travel through them as we develop through technological ages. When we start a new age, it's like watching the first years of the sitcom; everyone is solving everyday problems. At the end of the age, the leaders are the self-important artists who talk about themselves too much, and the people only watch out of habit. In short, Rousseau noticed how one story works to advance and help society, and the other two work to enrich the artists and distract the masses.

## The Politics of Stories - this is what we learned from the last time, so we can chart our course

We're already technically in the Computer Age. A quite glance at your smartphone shows that. Our society is in trouble because we're stuck inside the outdated red/blue philosophy of the Industrial Age. The spectular news programs, marches, yelling matches, and all that is a distraction. It's all spectacle to hide the fact that our red/blue leaders are no longer the classic heroes who solve real-life problems.

That's a problem. But the solution is a bigger problem. Because to make the change, Main Street has to see through the spectacle/art story. Only when they do will the stop being extras and become player gods. And that's really hard. The best example of doing all this is the movie The Matrix.

The Matrix shows a dystopian future in which most of humanity is unknowingly trapped inside a simulated 1990’s reality called the matrix. It’s created by machines to distract humans while using their bodies as an energy source. Neo, the protagonist who was once an extra, is recruited to help the few untapped humans’ rebel against the machines. His job is to make the sleeping masses inside the matrix realize the leaders are selfish, and the people should be free.

Neo wants the masses to realize the matrix’s rules are bullshit. When they do, they can remove the plug, and re-learn the majic of using their own tools. A person using tools to to overcome problems is the definition of a player god. And that's why the machines antagonist, Agent Smith, fights Neo so hard. He wants to keep people extras watching and feeding the matrix.

Agent Smithcan control much of the matrix, but not all of it. Enforcing the rules of the ruling philosophy of slavery, makes "the agents" bound to its rules too. Neo has a new ruling philosophy of freedom. Thus, he isn’t bound by the matrix’s rule book. A freedom he wants to teach others.

Neo takes on the machines. Unbound by the rules of matrix, he learns to manipulate it better and better. He majically jumps higher, runs faster, and soon dodged bullets. The machines, unable to match his wisdom, fight back with dark majic.

They get one of the freed humans to turn on Neo and his supporters. Not with the allure of power, but with the allure of going back into the comfortable matrix. The familiar spectacle of Rolling Stone concerts, television sitcoms, and V8 engines is all this modern Judas wants. The traitor knows its fake, but will accept it because "ignorance is bliss". The machines agree to give this to him, so they can forever stay on top.

The traitor losses. Neo is too powerful. In the final battle with Agent Smith, he not only can dodge bullets, but stop them in mid-air. He completely sees past the "spectacle" of items that the traitor said was "bliss", and only sees the matrix’s code, and can thus rewrite it as he wants. Neo soon kills the agents, calls the machines, and says:

  >I came here to tell you how this is going to begin. I'm going to hang up this phone. And then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world without you. A world without rules and controls, without border or boundaries A world where anything is possible. Where we go from there, is a choice I leave to you.

And thus, Neo liberates the people in the matrix.

## Lessons From The Matrix Is It Never Lasts Anyway

The Matrix is a classic story. So once Nero’s done freeing the people, him and his friends return to being equal members of the free community. Neo’s hierarchy of support was temporary, being based on solving a frontline problem. Perhaps he’ll be the hero of the next story, but maybe not. It depends on the problem and who the people want their solving hero to be. Regardless by stepping up, Neo can continue being the protagonist of his own life, by deciding who he'll follow, not letting the agents decide for him.

Spectacle and art stories do not solve frontline problems. Thus, their hierarchies can go on for as long as their storytellers can convince people to watch them, or live inside them. These storytellers, who are the leaders, are self-important, self-involved, who can’t solve problems, and the masses are just like the people stuck inside the matrix; distracted from the truth with a world of spectacle like shiny cars, copyrighted music, 9-5 work days, and sitcom re-runs, which people stay attached to via dark majic of advertisements, marketing, and loyalty to an old culture.

The longer the spectacle lasts, the longer the self-important artists, like Darth King, and Darth Blockbuster, can go on living inside self-obsessed stories. They’re happy with the way things are. They want to be heroes atop the hierarchy forever.

But like an aging sitcom, it never lasts. Eventually the people’s problems pile up, and they soon need a true hero again. That means a hero who can see through the spectacle of the ruling philosophy, and lead the people to a new society that distributes the powers of modern tools to humanity can starting solving problems and evolving again. It's better for everyone when the people rise up before a bloody revolution hits. Hence when Techvolution is so much better to fight for.

The lesson is this Stargazer. If you're life was on Netflix, would you enjoy watching it? That's why we started this journey together by asking if you were happy. 

You're happiness is the best indicator of which story you're currently in. How much money you have, the title of your job, the university you graduated from, all this is not the definition of happiness. Happiness only happens when a ruling philosophy helps people contribute to a classic story about evolving humanity.

The simple truth is we're in the matrix. Our red/blue ruling philosophy is the matrix. To get out, have to stop watching the spectacle, ignore the artists, and become player gods of our own society.

**Good ruling philosophy**: Embraces the modern technological age. Empowers the people with modern tools so they can be player gods who solve problems on the frontline. Civilization is lead by individuals who rise to the occasion to become protagonists. Once their spectific problem is over, leaders willfully return to being an equal member of the community.

**Bad ruling philosophy**: Meant to stop humanity progressing to a new age. Led by leaders who don't want to empower the people with modern tools or and return to equality. Instead the leaders distract the masses from their unearned, and increasingly self-serving leadership, with spectacle.

## Protagonist Kings - There is a time for growth and extras

Not all kings are con artists. There's good reason we tell ourselves stories of gallant knights and dreamy princesses. At first, the Medieval Age was led by heroes of a classic story. These kings and their nobles defeated monsters to create a peaceful country for the people to live in.

In Rousseau’s time noble families ruled every European country. They were in power because of their ancestors. After western Rome fell in 476 western Europe entered the Early Medieval Ages (500-1000). Often called the Dark Ages because there was no books, ink, or literate people to write anything down. Nor was there much else, like sanitation, military, judicial systems. Civilization was gone. Anarchy ruled. The Dark Ages sucked.

People like Clovis I, Charles Martel, and Alfred the Great took charge. They were master warriors who used swords, bows, armor, and cavalry to fight off invaders and vandals. Even better, they headed large families who kept some peace. They best thing they did was build castles to protect the newly remade cities, markets and and hospitals.

The Early Mediavel Ages was a classic story because heroes saw real-life problems. They rose to the occassion, rallied supporters, and fought the evil villains with swords, lances, and castle walls. Fittingly, a hierarchy formed around these tools. We call it feudalism. You’ve probably seen it in shows like Robin Hood, Vikings, or Game of Thrones. Feudalism was a rigid hierarchy of kings, bishops, dukes, sheriffs, knights, priests, tradesman, and peasants. In return for loyalty, the people at the bottom got what was called the "King’s Peace", which slowly let the people update their cyborgolgy with shovels, oxen, thatched houses, buckets, sickles, and other tools.

The people happily declared the leaders holy, because the country's stability was vested into the heroes own person. They were basically like mafia bosses. These kings didn't rule inside a official parliament or bureucracy. Like a Odysseus, Robin Hood, or Neo they were protagonists; making them Protagonist Kings. This was the start of the "noble divine right to rule".

Since society had no political institutions like dependable judicial systems, standing police force, or governmental departments, the personal rule of the nobility was definitely holy, for if they disappeared, so did the political peace keeping millions of peasants safe. And while it will be hard for us to appreciate, going to church, and believing the holiness of kings, made hard working peasants player gods. For the only reason being their subserviance helped their society to prosper. And the kings weren't bad guys. They had many battle scars to prove it.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/WarmJubilantIrrawaddydolphin' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
Protagonist Kings had a lot to do. The Vikings alone raided and invaded between 800-1100.

Under the rule of Protagonist Kings, Western Civilization rebuilt poltical instituions like court systems, town councils, sanitation departmnets. But it was slow going. By the time Western Europe had a fully functioning civilization again at the Renaissance nobody could remember why the story of divine nobility started. Who could blame them, it was a 1000 years in the past. Do you remember what happened 1000 years ago?

As Europe went through the Renaissance, the Age of Science, the Age of Enlightenment, the invaders were increasingly gone, the water was running, the roads were clean, the markets were busy. The once Protagoinst Kings, were now merely executives of very large and bureaucractic governments. The only thing that didn't change was the culture of noble divinity. The leaders had the title of king, but were not protagonists. They became villains protecting their privledge, who refused to let society grow out of the "nobles divine right to rule", and thus became Antagonist Kings.

## Antagonist Kings - growth/heirarchy/extras are temporary, people get their lives back inside ecosystems

When Western Rome fell in 476, the story of civilization went back to zero. Picture Syria today and you'll get an idea of the mayhem. Protagonist kings had a job. Grow a new civilization as fast as possible. Viking raids, Arab invasions, civil wars, faminies, the Black Death were all huge setbacks. But over the next 1000 years, civilization returned to Western Europe. Protagonist kinds and the feudal system they headed worked.

By the time Europe entered the Renaissance the system had done its job. The nobles were no longer protagonists, but simply average people who happened to be born with "noble blood". For the most part, they only waged war against each other, and usually only for personal glory. Otherwise they sat atop a hierarchy who paid no taxes, did no work, and answered to no one. These antagonist nobles used relative peace and prosperity to replace armor with dresses, churches with cathedrals, castles with palaces, and battlefields with banquets and balls.

Loving life, and without opposition, these nobles conned the people, and themselves, with art and spectacle. They lived inside an self-important art culture, where ever more self-importance, eccentricity, gossip, and titles, was the norm. And they distracted the people with spectacle to watch. Brilliant cathedrals, palaces, and wars against other kingdoms to keep the masses occupied. Like franchise movies, all these spectacles got more intense to keep the story interesting.

Visit European classic castles and extravagant palaces, modest churches and brilliant cathedrals, and you’ll see the transformation civilization had from classic stories to spectacle in Europe’s buildings. Compare the clothes of armored clad Charles Martel, and the dress wearing Louis XIV, and you’ll see the transformation from heroic protagonist to self-important antagonist kings.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/LavishIncomparableBumblebee' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

_Louis XIV (1643-1715). It's estimated he used 50% of France's annual Gross National Product to build and maintain his Palace at Versailles. He was a self-described god on earth. The people could even buy tickets to tour the palace. Louis wanted them to appreciate at rich the Kingdom of France was. It wasn't long before people's revolution, and the palace fell into disrepair._

During this transformation frontline problems piled up for the people. Their situation barely changed, and arguably got worse from 1000 to 1778. Their houses were still thatched. They did manual labour all day. They still paid almost all the taxes but were banned from advancing in official society. Feudalism became a caste system controlled by con artists who are rightfully called Darth King because they fought against distributing the benefits of an advancing civilization to the people doing the work on the frontline.

When the people under protagonist kings tended the fields, make the barrels, and fought the wars, they were being player gods. They were helping their civlization prosper. Security let civilization advanced through technological ages. With each new age, came more powerful tools. Along the way of progress society's ruling philosphy of "nobles divine right to rule" flipped from being a classic story, to a art and spectacle one. But since Darth King told themselves they were literally sent from God, they believed they were main characters whose leading role status should never end. The practical reason for noble divinity, fighting off anarchy, was ignored. The nobles lost the plot of their own stories. They turned their people from player gods into extras. It sent Darth King's civilizations into revolutions, and cost him his head.

## Repeat Story - We also had growth/heirarchy/extras, and now we get our lives back/ecosystems

I'm not sure if you know this Stargazer, but the Devil was once an angel. I'm serious. The angel Lucifer was his name. He lived with God up in the clouds with the rest of the heavenly beings. They helped God message his people below, telling them the virtues of selflessness that makes them great player gods. But Lucifer rejected God's teachings. He grew vain, greedy, and deception. Soon he even challenged God's supremacy.

God reacted by throwing Lucifer down from Heaven to be the dark lord of hell.

Free from the restrictions of justice, fairness, and good, Lucifer grew his evil powers. Soon he was the Devil—The Dark Lord who taught vainity, greed, hubris, selfishness, and everything else evil. But Lucifer kept is angelic form. He can thus be anyone, at any time. Like we can be angles, we can also be demons. The Devil lives within us all, because all humanity is tainted with the greed to sometimes think we can be gods.

The trick for humanity is to resist the Devil in us, and embrace the angels we can be, if we become player gods.

That's the Christian tale of good and evil. I'm sure many religions share a similar story. The story of Lucifer echoes throughout Western literature. Harry Potter's Lord Voldermort, The Lord of the Rings Lord Sauron, and Star War's Lord Vader were all once heroes. Each grew evil because they were unwilling to give up their power. They were corrupted by ambitions of lifelong supremacy. It's probably so common in our religions and literature because it's so common in humanity; power often corrupts.

Likewise, Darth King wasn't an evil person. The tranisition from Protagonist to Antagonist kings tooks hundreds of years. We're lucky enough to look back and see it all. But take Louis XIV. He didn't grow up on a farm, and in his 20's convince people he was their king. From childhood he was treated, told, and expected to be God on Earth. So he went with it.

During the Age of Enlightenment, philosphers like Voltaire, Hume, and Rousseau were writing about improving humanity with ideals of freedom and compassion. The nobility read the works wanted to rule well. After all, they believed they were fatherly protectors of their flock. Absolute monarchs with the power of life and death over their subjects, such as Frederick I, Emperor Joseph II, and Catherine II called themselves "enlighten monarchs". They wanted to rule the people well. Their mentality was, "Everything for the people, nothing by the people".

Darth King wasn't evil for being born into nobility. He is evil for holding his people back in the game of civilization. He was evil for wanting to stay king in a art story. He thus transformed the ruling philosophy to justify his rule. Which meant the ruling philosophy didn't match up to the technological age. The nobles became fallen kings for refusing to give the people on the frontline the freedom to live as they needed to live a prosperous life. And sadly, this story of fallen kings is repeating itself in our modern times as well. Our antagonists are also fallen heroes.

It’s important to note, while Rousseau’s followers in so many revolutions may have been political free, they were economically poor. Hunger, disease, unemployment, illiteracy, were all rampant. The time was basically one of "economic anarchy". This is when red/blue philosphies, bent on political liberation from kings and economic liberation from poverty, were born.

_Here's a tidbit of an Industrial Revolution business magnate George Westinghouse. Among his inventions was the air brake, fridge, and electric generator. Westinghouse was a good boss, and although many other Protagonist Executuves weren't, each still helped conquer the economic anarchy._

Like how society loved the original kings for winning the "King’s peace", the original economic kings were heroes for winning massive economic growth that won the "Executive's prosperity". These heroes said follow me, recognize my property rights, let me run the economy, and my company’s will keep you employed and improve your life with new tools like lightbulbs, stoves, and telephones.

Slowly but surely, they did. The orignial leaders of the Industral Age told a good story and thus he people were again a happy audience. Protagononits like Andrew Carnegie, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Louis B. Mayer, are basically the economic versions of original warrior kings like Clovis I and Charles Martel.

But come a new age, comes a new philosophy. When we hit the Computer Age, Protagonist Executives, become antagonist Darth Blockbuser. Another story of a fallen angel.

That should both worry you and make you happy Stargazer. First the worrying part; Darth Blockbuster defends Industrial Age tools because he controls them. He surrounds himself with story of self-importance, and distracts the people with spectacle. John Wayne noticed this started, not surprisingly, in the 1970’s for movies:

>Now the goddamned stock manipulators have taken over. They don't know a goddamned thing about making movies. They make something dirty, and it makes money, and they say, 'Jesus, let's make one a little dirtier, maybe it'll make more money.' And now even the bankers are getting their noses into it.

Increasing the spectacle of dark majic happened throughout the suburban "American Dream". Detached homes became even more more specular McMansions. Cars got bigger, more size, more chrome, more horsepower. Televisions increase in size. Food portions increased, sugar was added to everything. Rather than transform society to the Computer Age, Darth Oil, Telephone, Sugar made their tools more spectcular.

The good news is, where not at a "let's burn down society" point yet. We can transition to the Computer Age ourselves before the frontline gets so bad we stop being unhappy with our lives, and get rolled into a revolutions. We can usher in the era of mass collaboration ourselves. But before we get to that, there’s something else. Something that’s gone very wrong...

## Now What

We're in a dilimena, much like Darth King, Darth Blockbuster doesn't hate us. They're stuck in the matrix. Their own ruling philosophy defines their live and they'll never see out of it.

But who cares. That's why I'm not writing to "The Executive", but writing to you. If you see out of your matrix, that means you'll embrace the Computer Age. You'll search and seek out new digital tools to solve your real-life problems, and thereby become, and control, the player god.

The Computer Age was started by traitors. It's true. History calls them, with a grin of course, the Traitorous Eight. They were eight young kids, working for Shockley Semi-conductor in the 1950s. Shockley had helped invent the transistor and commercializing it. Sadly, he'd fallen into paranoia and made his workers miserable, They weren't happy because they knew they could change the world. So these eight unknown chemists, physicits, machinists, engineers, left Shockley and started their own company. It was still the Industrial Age, and hence these workers were supposed to be extras doing what they were told. Society yelled at them "this is a shameful act".

Who cares what the Sophia's of the world say today. These kids became protagonists of the Computer Age. These eight people are directly responsible for Intel, AMD, Kleiner Perkins, National Semiconductors, and many more companies. Indirectly, they seeded Silicon Valley with Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, and so on. Every Computer Age protagonist and player god today owes these eight people a debt of gratitude.

PICTURE

The world needed to upgrade our philosophy to the Computer Age. We need the usher in the era of mass collaboration. The protagonists of society never stop inventing, innovating, thinking ahead. The antagonists never stop being selfishness, self-important, short-sighted. It's the story of civilization. Good vs evil, right vs wrong. Jedi vs Sith.

And those are you options at all times. The only question is, which does your ruling philosophy tell you to pick? And the one you pick creates your ruling philosophy. That's the power of Main Street. To either by the extra of antagoinsts, or the player god for the protagonists. A decision you make right now, in your head.

And that's where we're headed to right now. Into your mind.


## The Rules Said to Rent DVD's Forever - we can adapt proactively, we either had to take it or.. wait, no we didn't

This book's illustration is a regular person standing on Main Street-a single person in the game of civilization. His or her job is to do what's best for themselves, and help society prosper. She's looking up for guidance and sees two options—heroes and villains. In the sky high above is the mythical "player god" whose playing the game. Will he play to benefit society or to benefit himself?

Extra: What does that mean, I don't like...

Player god: It means we...

Extra: What it means is hard times create hard people. Hard people create easy times. Easy times bring on hard times. You can't get around it.

Player god: No. Hard times create player gods. Player gods create good times. And then you get lazy. You follow the rules of Hugh Auld and the rest of them instead of fighting for what's right.

Extra: 

Player god: They called us pirates for downloading movies.

Extra: You were.

## Technological History of the Movies - Using what weve learned

Assuming you tried, it's funny how easy it was to find Darth Blockbuster on YouTube. Now, I need to know how movies and television technologically evolved. This would take weeks at a library. But I have Wikipedia so it'll take a few hours. Rubbish indeed professors.

So let's go.

The first thing to understand, is movies didn't invent stories. We've always, and always will, tell stories. They help us understand our lives and societies. Religious sermons, epic poetry, and stage plays have filled our need of stories throughout the years.

The movies, and later television, are merely tools that help tell stories. Each is a creation of three pieces of technology. Data transmission, data storage, and data viewing. Movies started in 1894 when Thomas Edison’s laboratory invented the kinetoscope; the first machine that moved pictures through a light source fast enough to give the impression of seamless movement. Hence the name "moving pictures", simplified as "movies".

The kinetoscope was like a vending machine for movies. Customers looked through a peep hole to see clips of boxing matches or dance routines. It was a popular novelty, kind of like GIFs on Instagram. Edison owned the patents and created the New Jersey based Motion Picture Patent Corporation (MPPC) to make sure everyone in the young movie industry paid their dues.

After a few years of MPPC’s interference and legal threats, in what amounted to shakedowns, movie companies moved to Los Angeles to get away. As new projector technology came, MPPC lost its patent monopoly anyway. The movie industry was free to grow in LA’s good weather, cheap land, and no stifling East Coast corporate hierarchies.

And best yet technology kept improving. New projectors could show movies on huge screens. Although reels weren’t long enough yet to show long movies. With the new projectors, movie theaters called Nickelodeons (because admission cost a nickel) opened up across the country. The movies were still novelties, showing exotic animals, news reels, or sports highlights, but getting better, like Instagram stories, instead of GIFs.

By the 1920’s film reels were long enough to show three act stories. Although sound still wasn’t synched with film, so movies had subtitled dialogue and theatres used live music bands to communicate emotions.

In 1927 film was finally synchronized with sound, giving movies dialogue and music. For the first time in history, full stories were not limited to a physical theatre. Any movie theatre in the world could show any story. A new storytelling tool was thus created.

Like Instagram or Netflix popularity today, the people certainly felt the magic of good storytelling, and the majic of needing the theatre. No longer a novelty, the movies attracted millions every week. American industry rushed to control the booming industry. American culture was told on the silver screen. Leading actors became cultural icons. The industry exploded with profits. Although the people controlled none of it, their interest and loyalty made it happen one movie ticket at a time.

Of course, all the technology that made the movie industry so rich and powerful was physical. Data storage, transport, and viewing was physical film, light projectors, and delivery trucks.

This didn’t change until a new tool was born in 1948. Televisions used a different mixture of technologies. Huge magnetic tape reels stored content. Radio transmitted content over the airwaves. And televisions received the transmissions, and displayed the content on tube televisions.

Broadcasts television companies like NBC, ABC, and CBS, now competed with movie theatres. TV story quality wasn’t as good, but the convenience was huge; especially as Americans slowly moved away from the cities packed with movie theatres into the suburbs packed with TV’s.

From the 1950’s to the early 1980’s nothing much changed in the entertainment industry. Movies and television got better technologies. Film reels got clearer, color, and widescreen. Likewise, televisions got bigger and bandwidth improved with cable. But no new tools were created. The people still couldn’t choose or produce their own content.

Then came new tools. The magnetic tapes databases that stored TV broadcasters’ content, got small enough to make home video cassette recorder (VCR). VCR’s cut out the broadcaster, who of course sued the manufacturer Sony for letting people break the rules and "time shift" television shows. The case ended up in the Supreme Court in 1984.

In a 5-4 vote the power to record and watch videos was distributed to the people; the extras were free to add the VCR to their cyborgology. VCRs, home cameras, and renting movies became very popular in the late 1980’s. The most successful video rental company took the name "Blockbuster", the common term for popular movies. The entertainment industry quickly forgot about its VCR objections, and gladly put its content on Blockbuster’s busy shelves.

Home entertainment tools kept getting better. In the late 1990’s came DVD’s and flat screen televisions. DVD’s were more advanced CD’s, and worked like videotapes, except they were digital. Meaning data was stored as "1 or 0". Plasma or LCD flat screens televisions were much bigger than tube televisions, and since they were digital too, they were High Definition.

Even more people rushed to upgrade their cyborgology with DVD’s and home theatres. Blockbuster rental stores were even busier, especially as people started buying hundreds of DVD’s for home libraries. The entertainment industry loved it. They didn’t even care movie theatre attendance dropped heavily and many went bankrupt. In fact, they started to use theatres as marketing hype. The money was in DVD sales.

Yet they didn’t notice, that the data transmission, data storage, and data viewing technologies of the movie industry was now almost entirely digital.

Except movie distribution. People still had to drive to pick up their DVD’s or less likely visit a movie theatre. Hence, people still needed to concentrate around movie theatres, rental stores, or TV guides (i.e. the castles with gatekeepers), to access their digital data.

Until they didn’t.

The internet, the transfer of digital information that was used for email and webpages since the 1970’s, had kept getting better and faster. And in the early 2000’s the internet got High Speed, and could finally transfer 1’s and 0’s of a DVD faster then someone driving to pick one up.

And here enters The Pirate Bay (2003). Like Napster, it introduced digital movies to people first. Although the entertainment industry used digital cameras, film projectors, email, webpages, YouTube for years, they didn’t want people using a new tool, but to keep using their profitable DVD technology; they even made two new ones called Blu-Ray (2006) and HD-DVD (2006).

The people wanted the better tool. The one that made their life more profitable. After all the countless hours needed to invent new digital tools was mostly done on their tax dollars in government labs and military funding and university institutions. Pirate Bay was the first to offer the new technology as a new tool to the people. It was a pain, it was hard to learn, but it was better than driving.

Remember the industry called this people thieves! Customers are pirates! People are evil, people are cheap, people are thieves! Really? Then explain the graph below, the one what shows how the evil people responded with protagonist Reed Hastings in 2005 made a new internet tool and gave internet movies to the people. What we call Netflix, by 2009, when Hollywood was panicking about BitTorrents, the people were finally given internet streaming. This was the same fucking time as Darth Blockbuster and the industry was complaining about human evolution.

If middle class Americans and Canadians are pirates, why didn’t Blockbuster stores have steel bars? The same reason why we don’t steal Netflix. Blockbuster was a fair deal, until data streaming movies was possible. Then Netflix was.

The people elected to download movies from pirate bay because it was an upgrade available to their cyborgology. The only natural rule is natural selection. When people choose the best tool, they evolve into better cyborgs. It’s not the people’s job to wait for an industry to catch up to Nature. It should be the other way around.

Maybe the industry would have noticed that. Instead, they were too busy surrounding themselves with art and wanted people to being distracted with spectacle (Blu-Ray, HD-DVD). While calling their own customer’s thieves, the movie industry held countless banquets and balls on the people’s DVD dollars; movie premieres, talk shows, award shows, and launch parties. Read books like Hollywood Interrupted and the revelation of the #MeToo movement, and these parties were, never mind self-congratulatory, but often even evil.

The industry became self-obessed artists patting themselves on the back for making every weirder films, while manufacturing cheap spectacle to distract the masses. The masks of royalty appeared again. Success wasn't defined by those on the frontline, but by politicking and ingratiating oneself to the putrid politics of a aged industry.

The Oscars, Correspondence Dinners, Emmy’s, Golden Globes, Cannes Film Festival, Sundance Film Festival, Toronto International Film Festival, and so many others. All modern version of banquets and balls, with gates to keep you out, and rules put in place to make the good times of the DVD going. Party loving, profit loving, foresight lacking is a recipe for antagonism, hence Darth Blockbuster rose up.

While the spectacle of Blu-Ray and HD-DVD tricked some extras, like with Wikipedia attracting people despite the supposed experts objections, the vast majority followed the natural majic of online movie streaming instead, even when it was against the rules to improve society.

Digital tools empowered the extras to fight back, and check his self-important art story. Nevermind that the people flocked to HBO and Netflix not only for the better technology and value, but because these companies emulated early Hollywood and told classic stories like _The Sopranoes_, _Breaking Bad_, and _Game of Thrones_. The people sought out these products.

In short, the movie industry was led by people who didn't know how to tell stories. They re-used past hits to squeeze as much out of the glory days as possible. Hence, so many movies were sequals and remakes that were simply bad stories.

The artists inside the industry got back at them with a system of "one for them, one for me" and made increasingly weired, unenjoyable, and politically charged art films.

Here's the frontline difference between spectacle/art, and classic stories.

If rying to make people shake in their seats by adding a motor isn't bullshit... So the people revolvted to new leaders. Heroes that used modern tools to do a good job and tell quality stories.

Techvolution tells them its right to do it. As for it being against the rules, it was, but the rules weren't updated to digital tools so who cares.

As for me. I was naive back then and never downloaded any movies. I was the sucker buying DVD’s.

Hey, do you think Darth Blockbuster will buy back all those DVDs, Blu-Rays, and HD-DVDs he told me, and us, was better than downloading? I wonder did those go up, or down, in value?

## Evolution Doesn't Happen Without Fighting - Main street has to act

Can't make up your mind. This will help. The force is strong with whoever holds digital tools. And that by design. The thousands of protagonists who built digital tools wanted to empower individual people like you.

The very foundation of the internet is based on the rock-solid value of individual empowerment. And this fact means Darth Blockbuster never did, and never will, stand a chance against today’s internet Jedi.

## Darth King Charles - Main Street Tried to be Patient - antagonists don't leave their stories

Antagonists may be well intentioned, but they’ll never change their minds. Indeed, the problems we’re having in our world right now, new powerful tools being witheld from the people's hands by the leaders of old ruling philosophies, has happened before. Let’s go back the ruling philosophy of the noble’s divine right, see how it all worked out for Darth King Charles.

When Rousseau was being chased around Europe in the 1760-70’s, King Louis XVI rule France and King George III ruled England. Both faced revolutions inspired by the pain on the frontline their high-spending lifestyles and government mismanagement caused. However, these weren’t the first kings to face revolts.

Before Rousseau explained frontline problems to the people, the people still revolted against noble’s excesses and incompetent leadership. Among the first to face the people’s wrath was King Charles I, who ruled England from 1625-1649.

Charles ruled as an absolute monarch under the "nobles right to rule" ruling philosophy. England had a Parliament but it was supposed to advise the king and not tell him what to do. After some revolts in the Middle Ages, parliament did however earn the power to approve taxes.

After years of his forebears mismanaging government finances and overspending himself, Charles needed money. The people and their parliament refused to say yes until they got more political powers. Charles refused to talk to them. Instead he sent parliament home, and ruled by himself for 10 years. He raised taxes by using some very old feudal rules. One retroactively fined some men for not showing up to Charles’ coronation 10 years earlier. Charles’ version of the fine print didn’t endear him to the people.

Parliament eventually got sick of this subversion, raised an army, and fought the English Civil War (1642–1646). The army was local men devoted to their parliament. Its officers were chosen by merit, while Charles’s men were mostly nobles who hired mercenaries to fight for them. The war between "parliamentarians" and "loyalists" was so bad it inspired the saying that life without a working government is "nasty, brutish, and short".

After four years Charles lost. He was held under arrest, while rules for a "constitutional monarchy" were being made by the Parliamentarians. But then Charles escaped, hired a new army, and fought the Second English Civil War (1648–1649).

Charles lost again. The victorious Parliamentarians were now enraged. They forgot about a constitutional monarch and charged Charles for crimes against the English people. While they didn’t have a new ruling philosophy, the people were at least questioning the one in power.

Charles didn’t budge. The rules were on his side. The Bible said he was God’s representative on Earth. He was the natural leader the same way a father is the leader of his children. Which is why Charles refused to speak the court; a father doesn’t answer to his children.

But then Darth King Charles did speak, and that fact, showcases how set the Sith are in their stories.

## Charles Speaks - The Proof is in the Words

Charles had a speech impediment. Often called a stammer or studder. No one then, or even now, understands what causes it. It's a piece of biological cyborgology that doesn't work properly. A person can talk fine when alone or with pets, there's sometimes a mental block in the mind when people are around.

That’s because for a stutterer, talking is like playing guitar with music notes written on the fly by a gremlin. Some words are easy to say, some are difficult hard, and some decide which at the last mili-mili-mili-second. The stutterer must jump around the words in real time. Fail and you miss a — beat.

But a stutter isn’t just about pauses, repetitions, or missing beats in a sentence. Stuttering is like having a mini-seizure. Your body seizes. Your neck tenses. You stop breathing. It’s horrible. I should know, because I suffer  from the same affliction as Charles did.

The physical pain isn’t even the worst. Getting that look from people is. The "what the fuck is wrong with you?" look.

_"Hello, my ~~name~~ I’m Charles. I wa-want can want to ~~help~~ discuss, the situation with the, ~~Parliament~~ House of Commons…"_

The prospect of talking, except to yourself and a dog, which Charles had two of, causes huge anxiety. The idea of never conversing with anyone causes huge loneliness and depression. The King’s Speech showed it well. Stuttering usually forces a person to be shy, passive, eager to please, and come up with weird reasons for their erratic speaking like hand gestures, random silence, binge drinking, and swear words (which, like talking to yourself or dogs, for some reason never cause a stutter). It’s entirely possible Charles’ relationship with Parliament was so bad because he simply didn’t want to talk with them. Not that he would ever admit he had an impediment. After all, he was a king!

My speech impediment was the reason I got a job in a car insurance claim department. After a vice president at an old company secretly told my supervisor I wasn’t allowed to talk to customers, for fear of embarrassing the company, I was like shit I guess I don’t have this damn gremlin under control. I wasn’t even that mad about it (although I was that it was an open secret for over a year). I never told anyone I had the impediment, so despite therapy as a kid, it was obviously still a problem.

So, fuck it. I decided to jump in the ocean and sink or swim. A car insurance claim call-center for a stutterer is like swimming the open ocean. A daily workout of all-day phone calls, angry drivers, customer service expectations, no "outs" like swear words, drinking games, or wonky behavior to hide behind. I was like that drowning desert fox learning to swim telling myself; "I’m getting better!".

And it was far worse than I thought. The insurance company wanted adjusters to answer ever more phone calls. To incentive us, they’d ring a monotone "bell" because… I don’t know.  They never said why, we employees learned questioning "the bell" was a bad idea. Management used it as punishment; "answer more phone calls or we’ll make the bell faster and louder!".

I’m being serious by the way. We were often more stressed then the person who just had a car crash. Whatever the reason, DING-DING-DING-DING almost all day, which gave people who weren’t stutterers huge anxiety, breakdowns, and stress leaves.

Super-shock speech therapy! After about a year I didn’t have to massage my jaws at night to release it from all the teeth shattering jaw-clenches I did to divert vocal stuttering. I was cured!

The point is this. That’s what it took for me to mostly never stutter (except when people try to limit my word choices in pretentious situations). It’s like night and day. The anxiety washed away. A hidden outgoing personality was brought out and frankly is fun, although still surreal, to be.

Yet Charles never had this lesson. Despite being adamant he was God’s chosen leader (or perhaps because of it), he was famously shy and quiet his whole life because that’s the gremlin likes it. Even when fighting for 16 years defending his ruling philosophy, Charles still probably had to massage his strained jaws every night. I can sympathize. The gremlin is an asshole.

Charles would have to talk. He was accused of being "a Tyrant, A Traitor, Murderer, and a public enemy to the Commonwealth of England". The people weren't replacing one king for another, and therefore staying loyal to the ruling philosophy of divie nobility. They were saying the leader of their country was a bad ruler, supposing they had a say who rules them. This idea is the origin of the king in the title image, the one the Jedi and Darth Vader are fighting over. That king represents the "state" which is exists from a social contract with the people, not because of divine right to rule.

Because a ruler of a state can be a king, a consul, a prime minister, or a president. Thus, Charles wasn’t only defending his life, but the ruling philosophy that says the nobles are above the people.

The prosecutors didn’t have Rousseau’s new ruling philosophy to replace the "divine rights of nobles". They simply said Charles was a tyrant and asked for the death penalty. Charles still wouldn’t speak. He didn’t believe his life was on the chopping block. Kings don’t answer to children.

Charles wasn’t pretending or bluffing. He wasn’t proud, or stubborn. He psychologically couldn’t understand even the idea of being wrong. Like an antagonist, he lived in a different story with a different ruling philosophy. One that made him the hero.

The judges convicted Charles anyway. He was sentenced to death by removing the head from the body. Charles was flabbergasted and now wanted to speak in his defense. The next chance would be standing at his own chopping block.

Fuck the ringing bell of a claims department, imagine that stress of a stutterer minutes from execution, having to say something to justify 16 years of civil war.

Charles only had words to justify himself, and the ruling philosophy of the English throne to his (supposed) subjects and to history. And… and… no stutter. Not once!

He didn’t just speak, he spoke so eloquently many people, even those who hated him, were impressed. Fuck… I’m happy for him. I can say beyond a reasonable doubt it felt like God killed the gremlin. What vindication! Indeed, Charles’s last words were a clearly spoken:

> Truly I desire their (the people’s) liberty and freedom as much as anybody whomsoever; but I must tell you their liberty and freedom consist in having of government, those laws by which their life and their goods may be most their own. It is not for having a share in government, Sir, that is nothing pertaining to them. A subject and a ruler are clear different things...therefore I tell you that I am the Martyr of the people. I die a Christian according to the profession of the Church of England, as I found it left me by my father... I have a good Cause and I have a gracious God. I will say no more.

Clearly spoken words about being totally behind the times. I'm still happy for his moment, but he gave England 16 of civil war because he thought he was a living god. The truth was, kings were no longer needed. The people could rule themselves. Charles should have been happy his children grew up. He could have helped them grow up by conceding powers to Parliament and avoiding 16 years of war. But he never comprehended that. He never tried to step beyond his comfort zone and expand his mindset or evolve. Instead he lived in splendor, hide behind spectacle, and used the people’s money to hire foreigners to kill them.

Later kings still didn’t learn. Even more distanced from the frontline inside their palaces, banquets and balls, their heads filled with different gremlins that said the rules are just, good, and will never end. France, Spain, Russia had country wide bankruptcies, food shortages, and revolutions, and it didn’t matter. The ultimate gremlin  is isolation from the frontline. Many more Darth Kings faced the chopping block with the voice of God calling them martyrs.

So the question now is... why did you think Darth Blockbuster would ever admit he was wrong and change his ways?

## The Majic of the Internet - Because of Cyborgolgy, If We Use the Internet, We Automatically Fight For the Computer Age

The internet has many protagonists. Paul Baran is one of the big ones. Here’s why.

The internet is a network. There are many ways of sending data through a network. The simplest is how phone systems do it with a direct circuit link between two phones. A call’s connection only stops when someone hangs up.

Alexander Graham Bell invented "direct circuit links" in 1876 and put it into action when he co-founded the American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T) in 1885. For generations direct links was how all telecommunications worked. But when the Soviets tested a hydrogen bomb in 1955, Paul Baran took it upon himself to make a new tool to help prevent a nuclear holocaust.

Baran realized to prevent nuclear war, the world needed a communications network that would survive an atomic attack. Only robust and reliable communications would ease American and Soviet trigger fingers during tense times.

Baran worked alone after work. By 1960 he came up with the two ideas he needed. The first was that his network should have no hubs or organizations (like telephone’s have) to control the flow of information. Central hubs make systems vulnerable to attack or failure. Instead data flow should be completely distributed so every node can send and receive information equally. Baran’s nodes network looks like a fishnet. When each  node has three or four links, the network can survive any attack.

Next Baran had to figure out how to send information across the network. This led to his second idea, which was to break up the data into standard-size little packets. Each message would be broken into many packets, each of which would scurry along different paths through the network’s nodes and be reassembled when they got to their destination. If one packet didn’t get there in time, it was quickly resent. This way there’d be no "dropped calls" and communication would always stay open. Baran published his ideas into very detailed technical specs and made sure everyone, especially the Soviets, could copy his work.

Baran then walked into a nest of villains in America. When Baran’s employer RAND recommended his "node-packet data network" idea to the Air Force (in control of America’s nuclear missiles) they wanted to build it. But when the Department of Defense got itself and the Defense Communications Agency involved Baran soon found out working with so many bureaucrats was hopeless.

So Baran tried to convince AT&T, in control of America’s telephone network, to supplement their system with his node-packet data network. "They fought it tooth and nail," he recalled. "They tried all sorts of things to stop it". They would not even let RAND use the maps of its circuits, so Baran had to use a pirated set. He made several trips to AT&T headquarters in lower Manhattan. On one of them, a senior executive who was an old engineer looked stunned when Baran explained that his system would mean that data could go back and forth without a dedicated link remaining open. "He looked at his colleagues in the room while his eyeballs rolled up sending a signal of his utter disbelief," according to Baran. After a pause, the executive said, "Son, here’s how a telephone works," and explained a patronizing and simplistic description.

The metaphorical Death Star rule book became real! It was against the rules to make a reliable communication network that might help prevent a nuclear holocaust. Good thing Jedi’s don’t give up. Baran continued to push. AT&T finally had him and other outsiders to a series of seminars explaining how its telephone system really worked. "It took ninety-four separate speakers to describe the entire system," Baran marveled. When it was over, the AT&T executives asked Baran, "Now do you see why packet switching wouldn’t work?" To their great disappointment, Baran simply replied, "No".

To heck with Darth Telephone!

A decade later Baran’s network was built when the US government’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) saw the wisdom in a node-packet distributed communications network. In 1969 ARPA used Baran’s technical specs to build ARPAnet, the first version of the internet. The people who made it were hellbent on empowering individuals, and the made sure the internet could not be controlled by any government or corporation.

Baran’s network is why our smartphones, websites, Wikipedia, any digital tool connected to the internet empower individuals. In the DNA of the internet is a distributed node network that nobody can control or shutdown. An individual has the exact same access as any corporation or government.

That’s why the internet is majical. Whoever uses it, is automatically empowered.

## Climax - Polar Bears in the Amazon, Collaboration is the future, as is ecosystems

If someone were to tell you how to vote, while looking over your shoulder, you'd be weirded out and call the police. And society in general would agree nobody should tell you, nor force you, how to vote. You yourself haven't done anything to earn that right. It's a byproduct of living inside a political ecosystem with guns used by recognized policeman, fair judges of a court system, and the absence of invasions or desperation that lets every member of the community cast a vote.

Your life wont get better until you think of a tools in the same way. The solution to your political and economic problems. Using red/blue philosophies is a recipe for living in the past.

Everytime you listen to a political speech just notice how many times they talk. Once you ask yourself what tool am I getting to bring down taxes, cap the debt ceiling, fight climate change, then you'll talking solutions. Until then you'll be experincing societal collapse.

## Did it work? Did you see the Matrix, which is asking did you see yourself playing the game more after reading this all

## A Fond Farewell - Listing all the metaphors and saying goodbye

I tried to make the history lesson as readable as possible. Almost all the topics and subjects are metaphors for the lessons Europe learned from going to the divine rights of kings, to the rousseau philosophy of political democracy and equality we live in today. Here they are:

The frontline is Nicolo Machiavelli's "effectual truth". Machiavelli came from a poor family, whose father gave him many books from the recent printing press. Machiavelli was the first philosoper to get to read lots of different philosophy and history books, and he noticed trends. He told superstitious Europeans, they didn't need to put their faith in God, because we can keep looking for trends, master them, and start to overcome problems like hunger, disease, and all that.

Soon later Galileo, Francis Bacon, and lots of other people, read this insight, and invented the Scientific Method, which systemized looking for "effectual truth" by simply testing Nature with instruments, and discovering the truth, not inventing it with reason. Hence it's the "point of contact" between a tool and it's use is an experiment. Thus the truth of the experiment is our guide, not the rules of the social heirarchy.

Natural equality, the extras waiting to become protagonists, is from Thomas Hobbes. He lived during the English Civil War, when people were again sick of the king but didn't have different ruling philosophy to replace him with. Hobbes invented human equality by saying in Nature (he called it the State of Nature), all lifeforms live freely, thus why shouldn't humans. Hobbes said people should still be loyal to a king, yet not because he's divine, but because it's in the best interest to have a stable and firm government because when that goes away--as Hobbes was personally seeing--people turn horrible. Because the king wasn't divine, his power to rule came from the consent of the goverened, who are like him, equals.

Something ... comes from John Locke. He came after Hobbes and agreed with his State of Nature, but said the people didn't need to put all their trust into a person as leader, but instead put their trust in the institution as leader. Meaning, the people should follow a president, not a king. That way the people can elect, new leaders while still getting the stability of government. Hence, the leader can always be a protagonist, and anyone who fights the will of the people, the people on the frontline, is an antagonist.

Ruling philosophy, old philosopheis, comes from Rousseau. Rousseau merged all the thinking from Machiavelli to Locke, and said the people can't rule within the confines of an old philosophy. Thus, even though philosophers from Machiavelli to Locke were giving new philosophy, they didn't say to breakfree from the past. Rousseau say change it all, which is why the people used him during their revolutions, and why I talked about him above. We also need to change it all.

The Sith and Jedi, protagonist and antagonist, is Hegel's Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis dialectics. After centuries of histories, looked back at the trends, and said there was a ruling philosophy, whose problems manifested into a competitor, the two would eventually fight it out, and make a new ruling philosphy that merged the two together. He also said master–slave is a relationship that recurs throughout humanity, and is the reason we looked at Frederick Douglas and Neo, who while was the physical slave, his captors were the mental ones, bound to a horrible social system as much as Frederick was. Frederick's process of self-discovery, was how slaves realize their status and break free.

Cyborgology, and majic, are Darwinism. The evolution of lifeforms based on their tools to collect resources. Life started out as simple organisms, and as these primitive lifeforms struggled to survive, they adapted better --biological--tools to do so. Eventually the benefits of biology maxed out with us, and so we have to continue evolution with tools. We similarly started to evolve (techvolve) with primitive tools, which slowly got better and better.

Death star, Darth Blockbuster, and dark majic come from modern psychology. And this is the real reason I wrote this book.

All of this is hard to understand. It seems simple because it's your life, and you think your opinions matter. But there's a reason we go to the doctor when we're feeling sick. They know the human antonmy, and we don't, even though we own one.

So the question is, if these are the characters inside the repeating story of civlization, which one do you think you are?

# EPILOGUE

## Stargazer Let's Look Through the Life Star

Stargazer, once upon a time everyone was an astronomer. Anyone could look up at the sky, see the amazing show up there, and make up whatever they wanted. Some answers make more sense, but explaining what was up there, from angels to fireflies, is impossible to see, so impossible to disprove.

What digital tools will do, is tell us who we are. It will track our individual decisions, and reveal us to ourselves. And are people going to want to learn the lesson, and step out of their own matrix, or are they going to justify their belief system the way so many justified the Earth being the centre of the Universe.

And that's the climax. A question as big as any ever asked. What's going to happen when we start to realize how much Death Stars and dark majic our political decisions are made under. Religions, philosophies, corporate manuals, and so forth making people press the button because they can't say no.

Let's take a look.

## My App - showcase the lessons along the way

I never wanted to write this book. I wrote a similar book years ago "A Non Functioning Society: Why the 2008 Economic Crisis Was Only the Beginning". All the lessons from here are there. For example, it predicts the western world is trying to assert a economic ecosystem, and thus needs borders. Trump and Brexit were as predictable as the orbit of Mars once Newton wrote gravity's equations.

I wanted to showcase how we can make smooth out our economic problems making solving real world problems with digital tools. Which be definition means people solving their own problems "Think Global Act Local". "Techvolution" would be a way to make digital products. That didn't work out.

My app. Using modern web development, it took just a few months of work. Take some free code from GitHub, an inexpensive cloud computing account, and the design skills of a novice. It was simple. Might not even get me a job in "tech".

The tool wasn’t polished because new tools never are. But it was, and would have been, so effective because it came directly from the frontline. A place far away from today’s ruling philosophy.

Here’s how it worked. Today’s car insurance claim system depends on drivers exchanging information like names or insurance policy numbers after a car accident. Drivers are frazzled so they usually don’t. My adjusting job was talking to these drivers to process their insurance claims. The one supposed to return drivers back to normal; at least as best to normal as money can get them. A big problem was simply knowing who the other driver and adjuster were. Since we often didn’t know, we had to search for it; literally calling around or hoping someone calls you. Delays piled up like crazy.

Adjusting sucks. Our only tools were a telephone, email, voicemail, checkbook, google, and a supervisor telling us to hurry up or get fired. Beyond st-st-stress stressful, very emotionally taxing.

Until you speak with a driver who is a real person.

Real person because their accident wasn’t an inconvenience but a life changing horror. Maybe their arm was amputated, or their friend was ejected from the car, or their kid burned alive twelve hours ago.

You’re mind shuts up Darth Call Centre the moment you talk to this real person. They have a problem and your soul wants to help.

Why did this happen? That’s all drivers want to know. Was someone trying to beat a red light? Was the road not salted for ice. Was it drunk driving? What’s the reason for the sudden terror of pain? It’s soothes people to know why the accident happened; it really helps knowing it won’t happen again.

My app combined several existing technologies, email, internet, GPS, google maps, and web apps, to make a new tool. It let insurance adjusters post an accident on a google map, and verified their identity by their work email. Since every accident shares the GPS coordinates, all adjusters, regardless what drivers do, can find each other. It’s minimal operating cost was paid for by rental car companies and repair shops, who loved the ability to email invoices directly to adjusters without having to call first.

A simple new tool that only someone on the frontline would ever feel the pain to make.

Society would have saved hundreds of millions in insurance claim operating costs. That’s cool. Adjuster’s and drivers would save hours of their day. That’s cool too. But this is the part worth fighting over. With my app, for the first time, we’d have a database of the exact location and causes of car accidents. Thereafter we could cross reference with weather, traffic, demographics, and many other databases. We’d finally learn why car accidents happen, and start to fight back.

This database doesn’t exist today. So, when tree branches grow over stop signs, tires are faulty, intersections jam up too much, pot holes get too big, or anything else repeatedly causes accidents, we don’t even know. With machine learning and artificial intelligence, we’d find trends to the millions of accidents, and tens of thousands of deaths that happen every year.

In a world held a bit steadier and comforted just a little more by such an app, who would be the loser?

People who don’t feel frontline pain. In my case executives, lawyers, marketers, and consultants. Like Darth Blockbuster, they didn’t know one thing about their own industry. Not one. It existed only to stand above in an art film of self-entitlement. Their self-entitlement, blank faces, clueless looks, arrogant smirks angered me so much it merged years of political theory in my mind, and let me see a new ruling philosophy called Techvolution in my head.

It was still hard writing this book. It involved condensing so much political and economic theory and history (there’s a lot) into such a short space. I was mentally pretty tired, and despite indulging in Jack Jones’ "The Impossible Dream" too much, a little bitter. Then I watched an episode of Netflix’s _Black Mirror_ and went back to work.

This episode was the tale of a crazed man, who wants to talk with the powerful CEO of an Instagram-like app called Smithereens. He holds a company intern hostage, awaiting the CEO’s call. Police surround him, corporate lackies try to deflect him, bullets are fired at him, but he still wants his phone call. Nobody knows why.

I started to cry. I soon wept. I understood this man and I knew why he went crazy.

I knew distracted driving had killed someone close to him. The man had been driving, and he checked his Smithereen feed, saw a picture of a dog or something, and he missed a drunk running a stop sign, and his beloved fiancée died.

I didn’t know it was his own distracted driving, but I knew the pain the actor played out so well. I knew that because I heard it through the same crazy cries from mothers and daughters, husbands and sons. Each just wanted to tell someone why it happened, so maybe it wouldn’t happen again.

I made a new tool that would have helped. Not solved. Not actual magic, but it majically would have gotten us closer. It was against the rules because solving problems is a good story the makes people realize art and spectacle is what Darth Blockbuster lives on is bullshit.

He’ll never say that, or even know it. He thinks frontline pain is a thing to stand above, not ever feel and solve with new tools. Darth is nothing if not detached. He is the epitome of apathy in the face of others’ pain. That’s his worst and most irredeemable quality.

I did my best as a protagonist. I was not good enough to prevent anyone’s Smithereens, but I did my best. The point isn’t that I wallowed in self-pity or guilt. The point is that neither self-pity nor guilt need to exist in the Computer Age. We can do better! The philosophy of digital tools isn’t a place of sword wielding heroes with a mass of peasants behind them. I pushed as far and high as I could.

Am I done fighting? No. I’ve picked up another tool, though, one that fits better in my hand and that may allow me to still reach out to many others who feel the need to evolve: a book. But I am just a speck in the sea that’s got to rise up and rinse the world of old sins and false beliefs. Other protagonists can pick up where I left off—they can go further than I could even dream of. That’s how society truly evolves: a pyramid of helping hands, not a pyramid of chopped limbs and ripped-up ideas. Everyone  is either an extra choosing the best tools, or a hero working to earn their  favor, in the ruling philosophy of Techvolution.

Who are you, Stargazer? Who will you be?

<!-- segway into Life Star/Milgram -->

Every person I spoke to was being rational. They were simply following orders. I was the outsider trying to tell them they don't need to. But were perfectly happy to keep doing so, and felt justified. In an industry so dependant on old tools, following orders was the means to success. Free thinkers were dangerous. New tools were a mortal threat.

I never wanted to write this book. There's no way to make people realize which character they are. Protagonist, extras, antagonist, Darth Blockbuster, all that is hidden by dark majic and social rules.

It doesn't tell us the philosphy that need, it's telling us the philosphy digital tools will show us. Just like scientific instruments revealed the Natural world to us, digital tools will reveal us to ourselves. We'll be challenged us to act based on our contributions to a higher purpose, instead of our psychological bent. Like scientists today use instruments to uncover the rulebook, digital tools will help us uncover who we are, and what our politics and economic tools and leaders should be. A rule-book already in use by open-source because it fosters evolution, not kill it like its opposite. I called it the Life Star.
