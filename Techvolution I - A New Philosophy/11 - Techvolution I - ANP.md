## Backpage

Are you happy? On the surface, Westerners have luxurious homes, full employment, and stable politics. On the inside, our middle-class deals with boring jobs, growing debts, stagnate wages, drug epidemics, crumbling infrastructure, antisocial behavior, political hatred, climate change. We have the freedom to vote Left-wing or Right-wing, moderate or extreme, and we've tried them all, but none have made Main Street—all of us—happy with our society.

Living happy lives isn't an unrealisic fairytale. In fact, it's a sign of a healthy society. What's standing in our way is Left and Right political ideologies. They were created in the Industrial Age, and since 1970 we've been in the Internet Age. Our ideologies are so outdated they're actually causing our frustrating lifestyles and growing social unrest. We need a new philosophy; one built to harness the remarkable potential of apps, computers, and the internet.

Here it is. Its big lesson is this. The middle-class needs to step up and use modern digital technology to solve our own problems. If we don't, we'll soon be suffering something much worse than unhappiness; there's only so long we can keep running our civilization on old—ideological—fumes.

## Dedication

_This book is for the people in the open-source community. For the collaboration philosophy you handed down to me. For selflessly updating Wikipedia, writing free software, and building cool new tech for us all. For being the protagonists of the Internet Age. You gave the best education a political guy can get. I hope I've learned enough to write this book for you._

_For the antagonists, the self-entitled delegators keeping Blockbuster—and it's Industrial Age mentality—alive, thanks for causing history to repeat itself yet again. I hope you learn something._

_This book is especially dedicated to the extras on Main Street. Because when it's time for you to act, I pray you decide to play the game._

## Quote

"_We are really the revolutionaries in the world today—not the kids with long hair and beards who were wrecking the schools a few years ago._"

Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, 1973.

## Note to the reader

I used many images and videos throughout the book to help explain some ideas. I especially did so, to showcase how life-changing the internet is. Today, millions of regular people are communicating ideas, opinions, and information with no middle-men to control their messages. Not since the printing-press has information empowered ordinary people so much. While I very much want to help creators and their audiences realize how historic their work is, of course all credit for the media goes to them.

Also, I use Star Wars, Star Trek, Harry Potter, and other popular stories. If you're not a fan, don't worry too much. If we were in Ancient Greece, I'd use Greek Mythology. If we were in Victorian Britain, I'd use Shakespeare. Using familiar stories is an easier way to explain philosophy, politics, and to relate to one another. Of course, all due credit goes to the media's owners.

# Introduction

## Politics

Donald Trump is the savior of Western Civilization. If that turns your emotions on, with tears or cheers, then you are missing the point of politics. Politics isn't voting for a political party, advocating for a political cause, and it's definitely not screaming at a TV. Doing all these things may change the world. But the government is so big—with so many politicians, civil servants, companies, and interest groups fighting for control it will never respond to your small voice. Tears or cheers don't make a person powerful.

Deciding how to live your life does. Because exercising, composting, teaching your kids mathematics does change the world. Good decisions change and improve your world—giving you freedom from dependency and power over your part of society. Since power is to politics what money is to finance, your personal choices are always your most powerful political weapon.

The question is, how do we increase your powers. The answer, we'll find out in this book, is better technology, and the self-awareness to use it to improve your life. But this isn't a self-help book about making you "happy." It's about making you powerful so you can earn your happiness.

Our civilization needs your happiness—it's trying to evolve into the Internet Age, but the established powers of the Industrial Age is holding us back. Our civlization is offering the middle-class a simple deal. If we grab hold of modern tools and join the fight to upgrade our civilization—we live happy lives again.

## New Tech, New Age, New Philosophy

Life improves with better technology. Deaths from disease, famine, and war have all gone down as our technological power has gone up. While naysayers love to spread depressing news about our world today, human progress justifies  much optimism about our future. Plagues used to wipe out 30-80% of our population. Famines were once a fact of life. For crying out loud, the month of March is named after "marching" to war because our ancestors did it so often. We have many problems today, but our technology in medicine, agriculture, education has given us a healthier and safer life our ancestors would call a fairytale.

Now we have computers and the internet. They are game-changers. Laptops, digital cameras, tablets, drones, digital sensors are all millions of times better than just 50 years ago. Modern technology dramatically empowers us to keep fighting off pandemics, hunger, ignorance, and war—but only if we use them to keep inventing and stay ahead of our problems.

In Nature, lifeforms often evolve in jumps called eras or epochs. Likewise, humanity develops new technology in leaps; what we call "ages." When a new age comes, its technology is so unique and powerful; it changes how society functions. Things were very different in the Stone Age in comparison to the Bronze Age, for example.

Today we're going from the Industrial Age (1760-1969) to the Internet Age (1970-). It can be hard to appreciate all the changes. There's a lot to think about when civilization's entire way of life upgrades to new technology. I've been thinking about our evolution for years and only now have a grasp.

Improving our technology is hard work, but at least we understand how to do research and development. Improving politics isn't so straightforward. Upgrading politics and philosophy happens with strong emotions, civil wars, and revolutions. I want to help you understand your importance in our political evolution. Because in 1970, personal computers and the internet came online. Since then, computer geeks, hackers, and innovators have been upgrading our society to the Internet Age. All the while, Industrial Age companies, and bureaucracies have been holding us back to keep their obsolete products and services alive.

Being forced to use outdated technology is why middle-class life is so unhappy. It's why we drive in endless traffic, still us so much oil for our energy, and can't understand the tax code. Middle-class life will only improve once we finish the Internet Age upgrade. There's no shortcuts, cheats, or gimmicks. There's just you and your friends on Main Street who have to do the work.

This book integrates lessons from the history, politics, and philosophy of prior upgrades, but it's not written for any buff. It uses the power of stories to help the middle-class see their duty to change the world. The first step is a new mindset. Because we the people already have amazingly powerful smartphones, high-speed internet, and other digital tools. We only need to believe in modern philosophy to upgrade to the Internet Age.

## Looking Up

There is indeed a lot to think about when society encounters a new age. I found it very helpful to "lookup" and imagine what our community looks like from above. Looking up lets you gain a proper perspective on our society and its technological evolution.

I didn't just imagine a better perspective; I got to see it. Play computer games like _Age of Empires, Anno 1800_, and _Civilization_, and you'll get to as well. You'll be the "player god" of a civilization—a virtual divinity who knows all and sees all, and who puts your general will into action using an array of buttons, switches, and toggles. As you play the game, you'll use these levers of power to decide what to research, where to place buildings, and most important when to click "upgrade" to a new age. Pressing that most important button magically transforms, every factory, hospital, road, house, citizen, to the technology of the modern era. Below, you'll see a person being the player god in the game _Anno 1800_.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/PeriodicTightElver' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

The above is a computer game, of course, but it represents reality pretty well. We're all in there somewhere right now, trying to figure out how to earn a living while the game plays around us.

That's why this book's cover page is a regular person standing on Main Street—a single guy or girl in civilization. His or her job is to do what's best for themselves, and help society prosper. Gazing up for guidance, the person sees two options; heroes and villains. In the sky high above is the mythical "player god," whose ultimately the one making the decisions. Will the player god act to benefit society or to benefit himself?

![Illustration](/img\sketches\playergod-stargazer.jpg)

In a computer game, the player god controls all levers of power. In reality, we change society when we buy clothes, do car maintenance, and save up for a new home. Funny to think about, but our everyday choices determine what happens in our entire civilization. Yet we often don't think of ourselves as being "player gods." But that's the big picture, isn't it? That it's all our individual choices that make up the player god in our real-life game of civilization.

The more individuals realize the big picture and act like their actions matter, the healthier their society. And the job of inspiring individuals to believe in the big picture is the job of philosophy.

So, what the heck are good political decisions today? Who are the good guys? Every newspaper, politician, and political party says they're fighting for the good of our society. But our politics have so much disagreement, how can a regular person know the difference between heroes and villains?

So there you are on Main Street today, looking up, trying to figure if Donald Trump is evil, or if the United Nations is trying to make a world government. You ask if Fox News is manufacturing fake news, or maybe "all of them" are. If so, what's real news? The questions never stop. Should the government-run health insurance, or a big corporation regulated by the government? Is climate change real? If so, why does my "green" obsessed company force me to drive to work every day?

It's all very confusing and emotional. Yet you have to pick an answer. After all, you're part of the player god as much as anyone else. Wouldn't it be cool if a philosophy showed you the difference between good and bad politics today? It is cool; it's calming to understand politics, it's one reason why I wrote this book. So I, and whoever reads it, can better understand our place in the never-ending game of civilization. But, I mainly wrote this book to create a new philosophy. One that will get Main Street to reach for their society's new digital levers of power. Only then will we finally enjoy the greater productivity, dignity, and freedom of the glorious Internet Age.

## Your Politics Is Hard to See Because You Are Changing

We create philosophies for a reason; we need to organize civilization. Philosophy's high—and often hard to understand—ideals of a "just and good society" get everyone on literally the same page. There are always plenty of theories to choose from. The player god must pick one that empowers everyone to use modern technology to solve real-life problems, and hence give society a happy life.

When a player in Anno 1800 upgrades technology, we can see the changes. Installing a sewer, damning a river, building a road, is very obvious. But we can't see philosophy change so easily; because it's our minds that evolve.

For example, we all believe in a philosophy of "Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." But what does that mean in everyday life? Giving people political guidelines is why we invented ideologies. Conservative or Progressive. Libertarian or Socialist. Republican or Democrat. Eaches docrtine supports "Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." But each also gives their followers a list of specific policies to fight for (or against) like universal health-care, gun-rights, or strict environmental regulations.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/CandidFeistyBuckeyebutterfly' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

That's a "tech tree" of new technologies, tools, and philosophy upgrades. Just like improving our technology, we also upgrade our philosophy with a simple "click." It's just so damn hard to see philosophy change because it's our minds that are evolving.

The point is, even with ideologies to guide our philosophical opinions, understanding our political views is still hard. We all look up at the same doctrines—we all try to "think of the big picture," yet we arrive at different answers. Our opinions are a by-product of our psychology, job, skillset, family, geography, culture, ethnicity, religion, time-period. Who can understand how all these factors intermix to make a political opinion? Why does one parent cry tears of sadness, the other of joy, on the same election night?

I can't explain it either. But I can help you understand politics today. We live inside the game of civilization, and inside this game, we develop in ages. At the dawn of a new age—a wealthy establishment always fights idealistic inventors to determine the ruling philosophy of society. The establishment uses the rules of the old philosophy to try and keep themselves in power, while the inventors use new technology to distribute power to the people. And the people on Main Street make a choice.

Does the regular person help the protagonists evolve civilization by reaching for modern tools, or help the antagonists hold back progress by following old rules? If you stay out of the fight, you support the establishment, keep things the way they are, and are thus an extra watching the story of civilization. If you decide to grab hold of the new levers of power and upgrade society, you're a player god, playing the game of civilization. That's the good and bad choice, and there's no bigger picture than upgrading society to the new age.

We hit the Internet Age in 1970. Since then, hackers, geniuses, and geeks have been fighting to give the incredible power of computers to Main Street. The people who control Industrial Age technology are fighting them off with things like copyright laws, non-disclosure agreements, and political lobbying. And the people on Main Street have a choice, do they step up to help the heroes?

That's a choice you, the person reading this right now, has to make. It's a choice as big as any you're ever going to make. Because if we don't upgrade now, it only means your kids and your grandkids will live even unhappier lives. The burden of transforming society will only fall on their shoulders.

A bit heavy to pull on your parental heartstrings, but it's true. Life on Main Street will keep getting worse until we upgrade to the Internet Age. Evils like debt, depression, disease, and war only stay away if we keep evolving our technology and philosophy. Don't worry. We can finish the Internet Age upgrade. The people only need to believe in a new philosophy that turns us all into player gods. My job is to make it click.

## We Upgrade our Politics Now, or We Lose the Game

Politics is quite emotional today. Actually, from the disputed elections of the American government, to the radicalization of European politics, I think it's fair to say Westerners fucking hate each other; and many don't know why. They're just angry. And not in the "I stepped in the puddle" sort of way. Mad in the supervillain whose plans for world domination are going up in smoke "because the other side is ruining everything!" kind of way.

Let's get some perspective. Today, regular people are increasingly unhappy. We pick an ideology to help us. Conservatism and Progressivism are the big choices because both spanned the world on the back of the Industrial Age and the era of mass-production. Conservatives fight for free-markets to help society create more property, Progressives fight for property redistribution to keep our community fair. This divide causes a tug of war over regulations, tax rates, subsidies, and other government policies.

However, digital property can't be mass-produced, or redistributed. Digital books, paperwork, audio, and video is automatically both. As our world becomes more virtual in the Internet Age, Industrial Age mentalities grow obsolete.

But rather than rethink hundreds of years of "Left vs. Right" politics, both sides go turn extremist. Old-school businessmen rally their Conservative troops with constant stories of "fighting evil communists who are coming for your money!." De-regulation, tax-cuts, free-trade are among the more popular right-wing rallying calls. In contrast, social justice warriors keep left-wing politics exciting by "fighting racist fascists who want to oppress you!." Their choir forms around demands for justice, regulation, and the redistribution of wealth.

Fascism and communism (thankfully) died decades ago. Meaning few people in Western societies call _themselves_ fascist or communist. And if few people believe in these ideologies, no political community can exist based on them. Left and Right label their enemies Nazi bigots and crazy communists to keep their believers in the choir singing against "the other side." Fighting phantoms is excellent television.

Spectacular entertainment is their plan. Left and Right don't want regular people to become player gods of the Internet Age. They want their supporters to stay extras in the Industrial Age because neither Right or Left will hold onto their power when our society upgrades our politics to modern times. When Main Street asks why their commutes are so long, home payments so high, managers so many, Left and Right ramp up their spectacle. CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, and the rest put up "Breaking News! The Other Side Is Ruining Our Country!" to distract their believers for a little while longer. Blockbuster sequels and remakes do the same thing when they jack up special effects because their stories suck.

_In the Industrial Age, Left and Right used to cooperate all the time. Not anymore. This video excellently shows the growing hatred between them. It's about the US Congress but applies in every Western country. Notice how the divide started in the 1970s and has grown since. That's because neither Left or Right knows what to do in the Internet Age, so they blame each other for the society's growing list of problems. Growing hate is a terrible and worrying trend._

The answer to hateful ideologies is to upgrade our philosophy. Sadly, in history, upgrading happens when old ideologies kill each other off. The Thirty Years War (1618-1648) is an all too good example. Fought during the Science Age between the kingdoms of Europe, when its rich nobility still justified their rule using the Medieval Age philosophy of "nobles divine right to rule."

Thus, when Main Street demanded a better life, the ruling philosophy only had two options; Catholicism and Protestantism. Thus, regular people picked a team and slaughtered "the other side" on behalf of supposed holy kings. One author summarized The Thirty Years War as; "a warning of the dangers of entrusting power to those who feel summoned by God to war, or feel that their sense of justice and order is the only one valid."

The Thirty Years War was extremely brutal. One in five Europeans died from it. The carnage only stopped when both sides were exhausted. The worst part was when the horror ended, the people realized they were no better off—and what they were sick of all along were all kings and nobles. Using the lessons of the Science Age, philosophers wrote a new philosophy of Democracy. Thus, it wasn't long until ordinary people finally upgraded to a new ruling philosophy. As player gods, they fought against Divine Kings in the American Revolution (1776), the French Revolution (1789), and many more afterward.

The hatred between Catholics and Protestants should sound scarily similar to the relationship between Left and Right ideologies today. Today's fights over presidential impeachments, border walls, and trigger words are a smokescreen. Neither Right or Left can see or admit; they're both behind the times in our modern age.

For our society to see the big picture again, we need a new philosophy. One that looks ahead towards the boundless horizon of the Internet Age. One that considers the work of protagonists like Tesla, SpaceX, Blue Origin, as a sneak peek for the wondrous future each person should be building now, bit by bit.

I've studied this topic for years. Academically, at the University of Toronto, I studied political philosophy, history, and innovation. But I learned far more on the frontline as a projectionist, line worker, an account manager, claims adjuster, and especially making a digital tool for an Industrial Age industry. I wrote this book to my fellow people on Main Street today; here's how we fix our problems and win the game.

You'll like it best if you're sick of contemporary politics but love checking-out what Elon is up to. Because you'll understand most of today's problems are—with digital technology—quite simple engineering problems. We don't have to invent impossible technology like time-travel to solve road traffic, rising health insurance costs, or personal loneliness. You'll really like this book if you know that unless we see ourselves in the video below, evolution will find someone who does.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KdE0p2joJw

That's our ancestors in the video, and it should be all of us today too. So, if you hate technology, despise your job, think the world is unfair, see conspiracies everywhere, worry about climate change, are intimidated by the uber-rich... fine, you've spotted a problem. But now what? You are the player god in the game. Only you can only fix things. And we fix things by upgrading technology and philosophy.

I wrote this book to get you dreaming again. It's written to be like _New Atlantis_, _On Social Contract_, and _Common Sense_. All books that helped start modern democracies because they made unhappy people on Main Street realize the big picture—our choices are our most powerful political weapon. We increase our power with technology. But only when we believe in a new philosophy will we be player gods holding the levers of power in a modern age.

Today, if we don't step up to upgrade our society, we'll keep suffering the unknowns of a degenerating society. We'll stay unhappy extras watching stories of phantom communists and fascists, instead of gazing up to a future as player gods in the stars.

And if we stay extras, at least with this book, our kids can read what their parents could have done as they regret the choices of player gods who lost because they refused to play the game.

## Here's the Grand Mission of Techvolution

Writer David Mamet once said being free from trying to please a group means being free to see Nature. So I embraced being a regular guy and was quite ambitious when writing this book. Saying that Techvolution has three parts:

**I. A New Philosophy**: This part upgrades our philosophy to the Internet Age. It gets Main Street to see the big picture; that we're all player gods who must use digital tools to solve our own problems.

**II. Building the Life Star**: Explains the new political and economic truth we'll see in the Internet Age with technologies like apps, bio-monitors, and big data. With these and other digital tools, we'll be able to create objective definitions of political and economic right and wrong. The Life Star will, therefore, remove phantom storytelling from our politics. In short, the Life Star will do for politics and economics what scientific instruments did for physics, chemistry, biology, etc. The troubling part is many people won't accept what this new telescope shows us.

**III. Starting Starfleet**: We'll design digital tools detached from the Industrial Age. As the Industrial Age's material abundance helped us live in so-called "perpetual peace," Internet Age products will make our lifestyle one of "perpetual profit." We'll send the massive savings to Musk and his protegees and hence jumpstart the Space Exploration Age—or as I like to say, "Start Starfleet."

**How to See the Matrix**: To write Techvolution, I mixed Aristotle's Poetics, to better understand Hegelian dialetics, and then I added some evolutionary biology. If that bores you to pieces, that's cool, you don't need to read more about it. But just so you know, Techvolution is based on a full-blown philosophy that I'll explain in another book called _How to See the Matrix_.

===

Techvolution A New Philosophy has a very high goal. So, I want to be crystal clear about its purpose. We're in the new and wondrous Internet Age. But we're still using the philosophy of the Industrial Age to run our society. Conservatism (1791), and Progressivism (1859) philosophy cards were clicked many years ago. It's thus no longer good enough for Main Street to watch infotainment news, donate to a social cause, and assume our political system will solve our civlization's problems.

To improve our world, we need a new ruling philosophy. One built on the accomplishments of our past, but that factors in the wondrous possibilities of digital technology. Our new way of thinking must unite Main Street to again see the big picture; that we're all player gods whose choices determine the health of our society. We should still vote and debate what's best for our community. But reaching for the Internet Age levers of power is our most potent political power.

With great power comes great responsibility—that's why the duty to solve our growing problems also requires the freedom to choose any tool we want.

Tools can be anything: a thermal camera to spot leaky windows, the Waze app to lessen gridlock, or 3D printing a tool to sell to a neighbor. The desire to seek out new tools is human evolution. Civilization evolves when its members read a modern philosophy telling them to become a player god of the modern age. We've upgraded our philosophy many times before. This book is the best way I know how to do it for our society today. I hope it's good enough to click.

_These guys run a popular YouTube channel about computer hardware. They didn't like how YouTube changed and decided to make a new video service called Floatplane. They thus became Internet Age protagonists. This is real politics. Because it promotes evolution. It doesn't matter if Floatplane thrives or dies. We, as individuals, can only try new ideas and see what works. Marching against climate change, or watching infotainment television is merely being an extra. The struggle with our society is regular people don't think to act like protagonists or player gods. And even worse, it's often against the rules to because Industrial Age companies want us to keep using their obsolete stuff. We'll overcome these antagonists below._

# Prologue

## Fighting For The Internet Age - Our Philosophy is Already Generations Behind Our Technology

The Internet Age seeded itself a long time ago. Starting way back in 1843, inventors like Ada Lovelace, Vannevar Bush, and John Bardeen were building the first experimental computers; clunky machines that filled rooms. At the same time, writers like H.G. Wells, Isaac Asimov, and Gene Roddenberry imagined what life would be like once the Industrial Age ended and more advanced computers ruled the world.

These authors' stories such as _War of the Worlds_, _I, Robot_, and _Star Trek_ thought of a future so hard to grasp people called it science fiction. Then came the 1970s; when personal computers, microprocessors, the internet, and other digital technology became real products anyone could buy. Here started the Internet Age, and it transformed the world just as much as science fiction said it would.

With every purchase, renovation, and Christmas gift since 1970, we've been filling our society with fundamentally different technology. It's easy to under-appreciate, but realize how just one of our laptops can be a typewriter, radio, voice recorder, book, television, photo album, database, calculator, and so many other machines. In contrast, mechanical tools of the Industrial Age are single-use, can't be easily shared, and need a stream of workers and managers to work.

Corporations populated the world with mechanical products during the Industrial Age. They put in colossal production lines and supply chains that spread across the globe to maximize how much stuff we could make. This era of mass-production was so competitive only a few companies could survive. If you've ever watched CNBCs desire for ever more sales and profts, you've already seen how hard businesses much compete to stay alive in the era of mass-production.

Digital devices enable a new philosophy, one that fosters not a competition, but collaboration. Using computers and the internet for online collaboration is our future because it saves us from the redundant work of mechanical tools. For example, with Wikipedia, the world can use one website for its general knowledge, instead of reprinting, shipping, and buying millions of encyclopedia books every year.

Now, several generations into the Internet Age, items like smartphones, laptops, and smartwatches are everywhere. That's why the collaboration websites like WikiHow, Facebook, and YouTube integrate so easily into our lives. A few minutes to learn the basics and we're learning, communicating with the world! Collaboration is today's big picture, the basic principle of the Internet Age's new philosophy. The people who understand this best are the open-source community.

![old philosophy in a new world]((https://i.pinimg.com/736x/02/79/3a/02793a3e97abcbdffb67194e225961de--alien-concept-art-science-fiction-sci-fi-concept-art.jpg)
_The land of perpetual profit. We're never going to get there with Left/Right politics._

## Open-Source Protagonists Are Pushing Us Into the Internet Age

Open-source is a growing community of inventors, designers, and programmers. They are the successors of the first computer protagonists. With honest hearts and genius minds, they're leading us all into the Internet Age as they live, breath, and promote collaboration at places like GitHub, Wikipedia, Dribbble, Udemy, Stack Overflow, Unsplash, and Slack.

These modern-day Jedi have given Main Street the levers of power we need to control the Internet Age, even if we the people don't realize it yet. Most of us still think things like retail stores, manufacturing, and education are industries only for governments or big businesses to control. However, because of the open-source community, there are countless new tools for average people to take control of their work, identities, and lives. It's like Cinderella can stop praying her fairy godmother gets her past the palace gates because open-source has given everyone an invitation to the party.

Open-source hereoes live to democratize technology. Every day they find new ways to distribute more levers of power to the people, letting us all share in our society's economic prosperity. Look around. Note the parents who are educating their kids on Khan Academy, the moms learning how to repair iPads thanks to YouTube videos, the artists selling their products on Wordpress websites, and the laid-off workers using Rails to make their own apps. By distributing society's levers of power, open-source has turned, or threatens to turn, many Industrial Age companies, products, and professionals into needless middlemen.

The open-source community has super-charged Main Street. No longer are we bound to be extras in the Industrial Age, hoping for a better life. Now we can become player gods in the Internet Age, making a better life.

I'm one of them. I'm a politics, history, and philosophy geek who spends far too much time thinking about this stuff. Digital tools let me write, research, host my work. I can very easily find world-class writers and illustrators to add a professional touch. Heck, think of the connection between you and I. You're reading my ideas with no middlemen, and for virtually free; all because open-source heroes put new tools in both our hands.

The open-source community calls this disruption. While disruption has thankfully torn down many gates, it mainly replaced low-hanging fruit like consumer goods. To keep pushing us into the Internet Age, we need to upgrade disruption with Techvolution—because only a society full of power-hungry player gods will finally turn the amazing world of science fiction into Main Street's new reality.

## Mass-Production Replaced by Mass-Collaboration Makes Us Happy

As a kid, I helped my family clean office buildings. My simple role was to pick up the garbage and blue bins. Other than the still hating the smell of old coffee, I really appreciate getting to learn honest work. Years later, when working at a big office, the cleaners were short-staffed for a few weeks. Management spent hours meeting about and discussing the "garbage problem" instead of just wrapping it up (pun intended) and moving on.

The Industrial Age started when the steam engine powered the worlds first production lines of wheels, lathes, drills, and presses. Even with the mechanical power, mass-producing trains, clothes, and newspapers needed a lot of manpower; which thus required a lot of managers. Look below, and you'll see a typical production line our ancestors worked.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(76.67% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/ObedientNiftyBlackbear' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='70%' height='70%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p> <a href="https://gfycat.com/obedientniftyblackbear"></a></p>

Today we don't work on the assembly line with bulky steam engines or massive presses. Much of industrial production is automated (or, sadly, outsourced). Most Westerners right now work in hospitals, construction sites, or in an office. And it's time for these workplaces to transform the same way the production line changed manufacturing. We do it by empowering workers to collaborate directly. Just as the Industrial Age had mass-production, the Internet Age has what I call mass-collaboration.

Main Street already collaborates. Millions ask questions on Quora or look up how-to videos on YouTube. What stands in the way of mass-collaboration at work is excessive management; an unneeded holdover from the Industrial Age. It's only out of habit that our workplaces still over-value control and delegation instead of contribution and collaboration. Discussing "garbage problems" inside endless meetings gives many managers something to do now that computers and robotics revolutionized us away from old production lines.

A culture of micro-managment by layers of management is rotting our economy. It turns leaders into gatekeepers who get rewarded for keeping society using Industrial Age technology. Whether it's deciding who'll get on the nightly news, get their products on store shelves, and especially who'll get hired into a corporation. Today there's an entire class of consultants, administrators, managers, and executives who don't know the skills of their industry like nursing, teaching, and (definitely not) cleaning. Their power is to be middlemen between the people and an Industrial Age technology like broadcast television, newspapers, or call-centers.

This desire to keep things the same, creates much antagonism. After all modern technology distributes power to everyone; that's how they enable mass-collaboration. Computers and the internet let workers and customers coordinate with each other directly, like you and I are right now. This new way of thinking is sometimes called "Wikinomics." With hundreds of thousands of active projects, open-source shows us how easy and effective mass-collaboration is. The open-source community works by coming together to make a core technology. Groups then use the core technology to create specialized products.

![old philosophy in a new world](/img\diagrams\techvolution-open-source-projects.jpg)
_Some of the more famous open-source projects. Most of this software, worth many hundreds of billions, you can download and use for free. If you can't program, it only takes hiring a few to get whatever product you can imagine._

For example, a large open-source community creates MediaWiki software. Then separate groups use MediaWiki to create Wikipedia, WikiHow, Fandom, and any other website you can think of. After all, MediaWiki is free for anyone to use however they want; gatekeepers be damned! More than just programmers, mass-collaboration is how the Wikipedia community of writers, researchers, and editors wrote millions of articles in just a few years. It's also how Linux, Android, Chrome, and many other excellent services work too.

All this praise doesn't mean open-source communities are perfect and can run the world. Open-source is only a part of the ecosystem bringing the Internet Age and mass-collaboration to life. There will always be big companies like Duke Energy, Ford, and Boeing with large corporate structures, mass producting our essential products. Likewise, government will always run social programs and install traffic lights.

That said, open-source is vital.

Precisely because nobody owns its technology, server software, operating systems, web apps, and so much other awesome technology are free to use. That means Industrial Age gatekeepers can't stop digital inventors from empowering more player gods, whether it's with a simple rotating list of persons to take out the trash. An online encyclopedia with millions of helpful articles. Or software to give society internet streaming—as when a few hackers tore down "Darth Blockbuster's" gate when he tried to keep us buying and borrowing his DVDs.

To continue opening gates, building the era of mass-collaboration, and pushing us into the Internet Age, the open-source needs our support. We can't ask any more of them. The Jedi have done their job. Main Street needs to step up and flock to their banner and grab hold of the levers of power they've made for us. We will, once we become player gods.

_Figma is a design tool for websites and apps. In the past, designers, writers, programmers all spoke through many managers. With Figma, worker-to-worker collaboration becomes super-easy. Your workplace can, and will, one-day foster cooperation like this. And it's open-source software that lets us build it for ourselves._

## Fighting for The Future - The Era of Mass-Collaboration Won't Just Happen

Once upon a time, I only wanted to learn about the open-source fight. Now I want to push it forward. Mass-collaboration, telecommuting, the right to repair, home power generation, and real internet privacy are just the tip of the iceberg. The visions of science fiction will be real, once we replace old Industrial Age tools. The open-source community must get political, get mad, and learn to be selfish because they're the leaders in the age-old story about New versus Old. Protagonists versus Antagonists. Jedi versus Sith.

![old philosophy in a new world](/img\diagrams\suburbs-idealized.jpg)
_The American Dream, if you want to live in 1969 forever. There are lots of antagonists in this photo. Newspapers, broadcasters, oil, gas cars, k-university education, are among today's largest Industrial Age holdovers._

The most dangerous thing right now is ignorance. People don't know about open-source or the future they're fighting for. The people are stuck fighting phantoms on behalf of outdated Left vs. Right politics. Both sides idolize 1969 because that was the end of the Industrial Age, and hence when they both peaked. Leftists think civil life is one long Woodstock "activism" festival, while rightist really think the perfect _Leave it to Beaver_ suburbs will return once "the socialists" are defeated. Our civilization needs Main Street to stop chasing ideological phantoms.

To do it, Main Street has to believe in a new philosophy. One that gives the levers of power to bakers and butchers over factory food owners. Tailors and sewists over sweatshops. Medics and nurses over hospital administrators. Engineers and designers over executive bean-counters. Store owners and clerks over franchises. We'll finally upgrade our civilization to the Internet Age when Main Street holds the levers of power as player gods in the era of mass-collaboration.

_This is Louis Rossmann. He repairs computers—but some manufacturers make it hard to because they want us to replace them instead. Louis advocates for customers having the "right to repair." Because of digital technology and open-source, regular people like him and his followers can band together as player-gods. Take a look, and you'll see mass-collaboration is already starting to happen on Instagram, Reddit, and Twitter posts._

## Open-Source Lets Us Bust Open Gates And Start The Internet Age

Currently, when you phone a call center, everything is recorded. The company has access to the recording; you don't. Likewise, when the employee logs in and out of the office, that, too, is recorded. Management automatically has access to these timesheets; the employee doesn't.

Access to things like phone recordings and timesheets are levers of power. Today, management and corporations put "gates" around our levers. These gates, and gatekeepers, are holdovers from the mechanical tools of the Industrial Age. Today they needlessly give power to one person over another. Customers can't confirm what was agreed to during their last phone call, and employees can be grilled for a long lunch. Yet, the same manager quickly forgets unpaid overtime.

A lopsided balance of power allows customers and employees to be taken advantage of, encouraging mistrust, bad products, and inefficient workplaces. Uneven power makes collaboration impossible.

The greatness of the open-source community is threefold. First, it sets a great example because it entrusts everyone with all available information. Second, open-source wants more members, so the community loves to dismantle gates and distribute levers of power to regular people. And third, since no one owns open-source technology, the people can empower ourselves with tools once only big companies could have—like call recordings and timesheets.

Distributing the levers of power moves us into the Internet Age. It treats people like adults and expects them to act like it; expected reciprocation fosters collaboration. We have the technology to do this now in our warranty contracts, tax-laws, employment agreements, and so on. We need the people to step up, participate, and demand it as player gods.

Once we do, all workers—from waitresses, mechanics, and teachers—will start to be managed less and collaborate more. Mass-collaboration will be similar to how factories and production lines swept across our society in just a few decades during the Industrial Age and the era of mass-production.

_This is the GitHub "repo" for Ruby on Rails, the free technology that runs apps like Basecamp, Airbnb, and Shopify. GitHub empowers programmers to work together, keep each other honest, and manage each other. Get familiar with how open-source works. It's a tell-tale sign for the openness, responsibility, and immense value of all work cultures coming in the Internet Age. You should be happy! Once you experience how easy, effective, and powerful mass-collaboration is, it makes work much better. And the best part, no garbage meetings or delegators are needed._

## The Setup to our Story — Making Techvolution and Player Gods

The middle-class has to step up and upgrade our way of life to the Internet Age. We must grab hold of the levers of power the open-source community has made for us. If we don't, we'll keep suffering the pains of a degenerating society. Stepping up means Main Street stops watching phantom communists and fascists on television. Instead, regular people must believe in a new philosophy that makes them player gods who take control and responsibility for their culture.

The biggest roadblock to the Internet Age is Darth Blockbuster, the self-entitled holdover from the Industrial Age. He antagonizes the future by writing rules to keep his Industrial Age tools, and himself, in power. These rules are like a Death Star because they concentrate the legal departments, HR reps, corporate lobbyists of a bygone age, to keep Main Street away from a happier life inside the era of mass-collaboration. Therefore, before our civilization can evolve, we need to defeat Darth Blockbuster and his Death Star.

And that's the setup to the story of your life. Will you become a player god and fight our antagonists? Will you fight to control our society's levers of power like timesheets, health statistics, and power generation? This fight is the very game of civilization everyone either plays or dies. It's not at all dramatic to say this; the fate of your children, nation, and civilization is on your shoulders.

I'll explain the philosophy you need to win, but whether or not you decide to become a player god in the game, is up to you. Once you make up your mind, the journey to win the game starts below.

![old philosophy in a new world](/img\diagrams\techvolution-main-street2.jpg)
_Lots of player gods have come before us. They did their job in the era of mass-production. Now it's our time._

## Cast of Ideas and Characters

Before we make you a player god, here are a few terms that will put us all on the same page:

===

**Player god**: Imagine a person playing a computer "civilization building" game with our society. They would hold all the levers of power and thus decide where to put roads, what food to produce, or when houses get solar panels. Of course, there is no such deity. In reality, it's the choices of individuals that decide what the community does. However, only when a person takes responsibility for their actions, do they become player gods who "play the game" of civilization.

**Philosophy**: The largely unspoken ideals that tell individuals what's right and wrong, good and bad, in science, art, morals, politics, and economics. Philosophy is supposed to unite individuals to see the big picture; that everyone's choices matter, because everyone is a player god.

**Ruling philosophy**: A civilization's chosen philosophy. One that all factions/ideologies agree on. Examples include the "Divine Rights of Kings," derived from Christian theology and used in royalist Europe; "Marxist-Leninism" of the Soviet Union; and the combination of "Right/Left" philosophies of the Western world today. The ruling philosophy is supposed to help society win the game of civilization.

**Happiness**: The test of how well the ruling philosophy is doing its job. Spending quality time with family, having good friends, working a steady job, being in good physical and mental health, looking forward to the future, are all signs of (genuine) happiness.

**Rulebook**: The written and unwritten social, workplace, and legal rules that govern everyday life. People write the rulebook by interpreting the ruling philosophy. Some examples are city by-laws, workplace seniority rules, and environmental regulations.

**Technology**: A catchall term for things we make tools from, like concrete, lumber, nails, shingles, insulation, and bricks.

**Tool**: A catchall term for things we create with technology to solve a problem, like guns to kill bad guys, books to record and pass on knowledge, and houses to shelter in. We use tools to evolve.

**Levers of Power**: The most powerful tools; the ones that control society. In Civilization games, these are the buttons, toggles, and sliders players use to play. In reality, levers of power are the tools that power, educate, inform, feed, and transport resources in our society.

**Frontline**: The point of contact between a tool and the problem. Nurses giving vaccines, cleaners cleaning a city bus, and soldiers on the battlefield are all examples of frontline settings. People on the frontline work on Main Street with jobs that solve specific problems with a proven skillset. Frontline workers physically hold the levers of power, but don't always control them—they will, once the era of mass-collaboration starts.

**Hierarchy**: A power structure that manages every lever of power's use by society. Kings and queens with the keys to the castle, or the corporate ladder at Blockbuster controlling DVD rentals, are examples of past hierarchies. As hierarchies grow, they get more detached from the frontline. Also, they start forming gates around their tools to protect their power being replaced. If they grow large rnough, people in the regime give themselves titles like prince and executive, baron, and supervisor to mark their position—and, in a sense, their territory and "rights" in the power structure.

**The Game of Civilization**: The invention of technology, and the creation of tools, to overcome frontline problems. Civilization develops new technology in ages. As new technology makes new tools, they create new levers of power which inventors use to open the gates—and topple the hierarchies—of the prior era.

**Protagonists**: People who invent, spread, and use new technology for the greater good. Usually close to the problems on the frontline, they individually struggle, but their continued self-sacrifice slowly improves life on Earth. I call them this world's Jedi knights. We call their leaders trailblazers who often skirt the rules. Galileo, Nikola Tesla, Jay Last, Michael S. Hart, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Linus Torvalds, and Elon Musk are among their number.

**Antagonists**: People who selfishly defend their wealth, power, and prestige atop a hierarchy. Antagonists manage companies or institutions based on dated technologies and think that working on the frontline is beneath them. They work to control society's rulebook, so they can prevent protagonists' new tools, becoming new levers of power. We don't often individually identify them. I coined the term "Darth Blockbuster" so we can.

**Extras**: Everybody in the middle of a battle between antagonists and protagonists. Because they're unattached to either side, extras can pick winners and losers. Usually, extras are in the middle class, not so poor as to be desperate, but not so powerful that they want to keep the world the same. Sadly, extras don't realize their power and often refuse to acknowledge they're even in a game of civilization. When they do, they become player gods. If they don't, the game of civilization turns into a story they merely watch. Extras blame phantom ideologies for their real-life problems.

**The Death Star**: The rulebook when it's controlled by Darth Blockbuster. Today it exists inside many regulations, agreements, manuals, contracts, and laws that prevent new levers of power from reaching Main Street. The Death Star is currently busy trying to keep the Industrial Age alive.

**Techvolution**: A new philosophy empowering seamless human technological evolution by ridding Darth Blockbuster of his power, by giving player gods the right and duty to decide when society should upgrade our tools.

**The Life Star**: A rulebook based on Techvolution, governed by human technological adaption and natural selection that makes sure humanity never again creates antagonists and stalls when upgrading to the next technological age.

**Plot**: Getting the extras to step up, grab hold of society's new digital levers of power, and become player gods who replace their ruling philosophy with Techvolution and thereby establish the era of mass-collaboration inside the Internet Age.

![frontline](/img\diagrams\techvolution-frontline2.jpg)
_Our civilizations have always had problems. It's up to regular people to use new tools to solve them. It's simply our turn to today. Let's get started._

# ACT ONE

## The Beginning

It all started with a door in my face. And then, actually, a few more. I was either being too stubborn or too hopeful. Either way, I eventually learned my lesson. I was selling a web app that those in upper management were never going to buy.

Before you wonder, it wasn't a matter of price, because there was no price. It wasn't a question of competition. None of that either. And I can promise it worked, because I had spent years in a cubicle doing the frontline job it serviced. After years of thinking about political and economic theory in the Internet Age, I'd written a book (Starting Starfleet) about some untapped possibilities of new tech like smartwatch apps, bio-monitors, and bitcoin. I only made this simple web app (using open-source technologies) validate some of my ideas.

I was right to. They were good ideas. I figured out how to solve a problem and save 100 million dollars, 300,000 hours of worker productivity, and even dozens of lives. All I did was enable worker-to-worker collaboration with an app that was virtually free. Why wouldn't I want to tell people about the theory behind it?

Sadly, I was a fool. I didn't know it at the time, but I wasn't even knocking on doors. I was knocking on gates. See, I wasn't talking to frontline workers (who thanked me). But to the bureaucrats, lawyers, managers, and executives who were well paid to "meet, discuss, delegate" about "garbage problems." As holdovers from the obessive management of the Industrial Age, I went against all they stood for; solving their problems was asking them to fire themselves. Worse, I was asking them to invalidate their identity as being "superiors." It's why they put up gates to shut out, not promote, Internet Age innovation. In their mind, the levers of power, even small ones, are theirs by right.

In retrospect, all this antagonism was damn exciting. I was standing at a historic moment in time. Here the Industrial Age was taking its last stand against human evolution.

That's why the head office people never said no to me. No needs a reason. Instead, they simply said it was against the rules to say yes. You know—those obscure rules, hidden inside regulations and contracts. They believed in the rules, especially the one against frontline workers acting with initiative, holding their own levers, and taking out their own garbage, so to speak.

Like anyone, I knew bringing new products to market is hard. I knew sales is difficult. I even knew antagonists exist. But I didn't realize how strongly the Internet Age was being held back. Antagonists do a good job masking their self-interest with self-righteous rules. In their eyes, I wasn't an innovator helping his society win the game, but just an "uppity extra" stepping out of his place in the hierarchy.

I don't want dwell about my experience too much. All that's important is this. There was a huge problem costing millions of dollars, weeks of workers' time (lots of it unpaid overtime), and maybe even your life. And it was against the rules to solve it. Even if I had won this battle for the Internet Age, it would be a tiny victory.

So instead, I'm going to talk about winning the war. Our hospitals, schools, repair-shops, governemnt bureaucracies—our entire way of life is being held back from the Internet Age by a group of self-entitled holdovers of the Industrial Age.

To help us win the game, I learned my lesson and wrote this book. Because despite already having the digital technology to improve our lives, antagonists maintain gates all over the place to protect the pre-digital "Woodstock of 1969" way of life. They know—even if subconsciously—they lose their managerial status, executive positions, and superiority complexes in an Internet Age mass-collaboration economy. Being held back from this brighter future is why our lives are so unhappy. To improve our days then, the people need a new ruling philosophy... one that says improving our society is the only rule that matters.

## To Upgrade Our Civilization We Need To Reach for the Tools

Do you love stories? I think it’s a safe bet to say that you do. Who doesn’t? They entertain us after a hard day of work, bring us together to share our joys, and (my favorite) open our minds to the different rules, philosophies, and technologies of foreign cities, mythical worlds, and galaxies far, far away.

Stories are so powerful because they’re so simple. Protagonists are good because they want to fix a problem. Antagonists are bad because they don’t. Stories aren’t debates. We take the protagonist’s side. Thus, Romeo and Juliet’s love is beautiful and worth dying for, while their families’ feud is ignorant and stupid. Luke Skywalker’s rebellion is righteous and worth fighting for, while Darth Vader’s empire is wicked and should be destroyed.

Our moral clarity about a problem turns the protagonists into our heroes and the antagonists into our villains. We follow their story with strong emotions—which burst out at the climax as we find out who wins.

Our hero fights hard to defeat the bad guys, but his superior morality, justice, and heroism aren’t enough. He’s often too weak or unskilled, and the villain beats him bloody. On the verge of failure, the hero needs to find something that’ll turn the tide in his favor. He seeks, sees, and reaches for his salvation: a tool or a weapon, like a gun, magic book, or lightsaber.

Will our hero reach it first, or will the enemy? We in the audience, like extras in the story, hold our breath because the story’s society is controlled not by marches, protests, or rules, but by which character holds the tools. The wielder is the victor. The victor writes the rules. It’s the lesson that we the people need to learn for ourselves. Reaching for, and holding the levers of power is how we'll stop being bystanders in our own societies, and start being player gods inside the Internet Age.

![levers of power](/img\diagrams\techvolution-levers-of-power.jpg)
_Levers of power. Whoever holds them, wins._

## Player Gods Reach for the Tools and Don't Chase Phantoms

Many people know what a revolution is. The difference between it and Techvolution is a revolution wants to change rulemakers, while Techvolution wants to distribute new levers of power. Techvolution is better. Because if you still think the rules, regulations, and laws of society control our destiny. They don't. I'll show you why.

Talk to any political junkie, no matter when, and they'll say there's a big election coming up. They'll say something like, "if the red team wins this one, then education, healthcare, infrastructure, and everything else will go to shit." What he means is elections decide the rule-makers, and that blue rules make a good society while red rules make a bad one.

If you buy it—and most of us have at some point—you watch blue cable news, read blue blogs, listen to blue talk radio. You start seeing phantom enemies everywhere because you've filled your head with blue's philosophy. Soon enough, your car has blue bumper stickers, and you're waving blue bristol boards while screaming blue chants at rallies, marches, and protests. You feel like a hero! You're fighting against the evil red philosophy!... Or, if you got sucked in by the other side, evil blue philosophy!

Let me ask you this: if you're a regular middle-class person and you ignored the election, how much would you bet that you would know who won just by continuing to live your life?

When Team Blue wins, does traffic suddenly disappear? When Team Red succeeds, does everyone suddenly exercise? Do you breathe fresher air or see fitter neighbors? Do your real-life problems get solved when one color's philosophy writes the rules?

Policies, manuals, and guidelines aren't today's levers of power. There is no law that promotes climate change, allows unpaid overtime, or encourages car accidents. That's why Left/Right blame "the other side", because only controlling government policy makes each powerless to solve our biggest problems.

Thus, why should the middle-class believe in government policy, when we can grab hold of the new digital levers of power and become player gods who fight climate change, disallows unpaid overtime, and prevents car crashes?

If you'd rather stay an extra, you can go back to watching the pundits, columnists, and commentators waiting to sing to their choir, telling you to fight "the enemy" until you're literally blue in the face. But you shouldn't. In truth, the "other side" are part of the same struggling middle class, and this book will turn all of us into player gods of the Internet Age.

The first thing to realize is whichever color wins an election this year or the next and re-writes the rules; regular people will still pay too many taxes, have a huge mortgage, waste hours in traffic, pay increasing energy bills, have credit scores controlled by strangers, sleep less than they're supposed to, get confused by their health insurance, apply for jobs with no information on the company's culture, endure customer abuse, get micro-managed, and hope their job (which they likely hate) isn't downsized or outsourced.

Nothing changes when Main Street elects Conservatism or Progressivism, because the truth is; regulations and laws aren't strong enough to solve todays problems.

Our politicians' ignore the potential of digital tools. And it's not their fault. Right/Left philosophies were created at the start of the Industrial Age. A time when humans only had a few tools at hand. Red/blue philosophical fathers like Adam Smith, Edmund Burke, John Stuart Mill, and Karl Marx never had running water, listened to the radio, made a phone call, opened a fridge, took penicillin, started a motor, typed on a keyboard, or learned about evolution.

![old philosophy in a new world](/img\diagrams\techvolution-mud-roads-sail-boats.jpg)
_Cutting edge technology when Left/Right were born._

Instead, our Right/Left philosophical fathers had mud roads, grandfather clocks, and abacus calculators. Being hungry and sick, cold, and ignorant was a way of life back then. Right/Left philosophers dreamed of improving this primitive world with better tools. And, truth be told, they did! These philosophies got our ancestors to agree on the same "big picture"; everyone needed to globalize the world to industrialize society via mass-production. Soon society upgraded to steam engines, sanitation systems, science labs, telephone networks, broadcast televisions, and computers the size of rooms.

During the Industrial Age, the people needed to be managed inside huge corporations and color-coded parties. Although calling exhausted farmers and overworked factory workers player gods may seem silly; it's not. Someone needed to be using primitive tools to make better ones. To their credit, the blue and red philosophies at least gave regular people a voice in how their factories, regulations, and profits were controlled.

Today, however, we live inside the world the Industrial Age dreamed of making. We've grown a massive ecosystem of cities, factories, offices, telecommunications, and digital technology. The Industrial Age has done its job. It's time to transform the people into player gods using the digital tools they worked so hard to create.

Happily, we already are. That's the reason we're so addicted to new technology. Checking news feeds, flying drones, taking endless photos, playing computer games are acts of extras learning the tools of player gods. Our ancestors did the same when learning about printed books, telescopes, and muskets. Those were merely addictive toys until new philosophies turned them into the lightsabers that finally brought down Darth King and the Medieval Age. It was mastering new tools, that let ordinary people control new levers of power so they could read unknown history, see the universe for themselves, and revolt against royalty in revolutions.

Our addicting toys are also levers of power. They're so powerful, we can use these proverbial lightsabers to earn a happier life without revolutions. We will, once we forget about Left/Right phantoms, and use Techvolution to defeat Darth Blockbuster, his Death Star, and upgrade to the Internet Age.

_Here's a sample of Left/Right leaders singing to the choirs. Since ideologues can't make Floatplane, or repair your broken laptop, or make any product you might need, they distract with bickering instead. This bullshit only works as long as you listen._

## Once We Believe in a New philosophy, We'll Reach for the Stars

Darth Blockbuster appears everytime we upgrade to a new age. He works hard to secure his power by preventing regular people taking control of the new levers of power. To fight the antagonists off, we need a modern philosophy. Here's one example.

When you look up at the night sky, you see a dazzling show. It can seem to defy explanation. But even with the naked eye, you'll see trends. The stars never move, some "objects" (really planets) look to be wandering, and it looks like the Moon, Sun, and everything else revolves around you. With all this evidence, our ancestors were sure Earth was the center of the Universe. So much so, it was a pivotal part of the "Divine Rights of Kings" philosophy that ruled European Kingdoms starting in the Medieval Age (500-1400) and even into the Science Age (1543-1687).

When you look at the night sky with a telescope, like Galileo (1564-1642) did, you see it differently. Jupiter has moons, Venus has phases, and it looks like Earth is just another planet. When Galileo told everyone these facts, the "divine kings" were threatened. By using a telescope, Galileo was saying, "we don't know until we test, so let's use instruments to test what we think we know." Scientific inquiry questioned the ruler's divine leadership. Although Catholics and Protestant political leaders hated each other, they worked together to suppress Galileo. Neither facilitated the new truths his new tools were discovering.

Galileo is just one example of how an establishment finds it very hard to embrace a new era. The lesson is, to enter into a new age, civilization can't just use new technology. Main Street must welcome a modern philosophy too. Today we're also using an outdated philosophy from a bygone Age. Here's an example of how that's hurting our everyday lives.

Space travel is a significant step for humanity. It means better satellites, worldwide internet accessibility, and ensuring intelligent life doesn't put all its eggs in one earthly basket. All possible _if_ we can build an affordable and reusable rocket.

Left/Right political culture was unable to explore space. They can gossip about speeches, but rocket science doesn't fit into soundbites. It was new companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin (funded by a few rich protagonists) who answered the call. They harnessed digital technology and fostered collaboration to make rockets 10 times cheaper. The protagonists even learned to land their rockets to be reused! Think how cool that is. But many people, especially Left/Right politicians, still didn't care.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/DeliriousOffbeatHedgehog' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

_This was when SpaceX landed its first rocket. Enable the sound to really get a feel on how important this event was; a significant step for the Internet Age._

When you're dependent on old philosophies, you're also confined to its old tools and live within its old narratives. Today Left/Right politics obsesses over tax cuts, health insurance plans, pages of government regulations, and endless media soundbites because their philosophy says these are society's only levers of power. New and super-powerful technologies like SpaceX are talked about, but more as a novelty act that falls beyond the believers of old philosophies comprehension and comfort zones.

That's the power of philosophy. It tells people which tools are important, and which should be ignored. Today, Industrial Age philosophies hold back the incredible, world-changing, happiness granting potential of the Internet Age. Up and down our economy, we use Industrial Age heavy management practices when mass-collaboration is far better. The lesson is, once we believe in a new philosophy that embraces the Internet Age, we'll control our society's true levers of power, and soar to the stars.

![old philosophy in a new world](/img\diagrams\techvolution-missing-the-boat.png)
_Here’s when SpaceX landed its first and second rockets. At the exact same time, ideologue Bernie Sanders was ranting about regulation battles with Wall Street. He should have been taking a minute to appreciate all the new solutions SpaceX just opened to humanity. The middle-class needs to stop putting their faith in old philosophies and instead become player gods with the amazing new tools digital protagonists are giving us today. Like we followed Galileo generations ago._

## Techvolution is a Fight as Natural as Evolution

Fighting to upgrade our ruling philosophy is a classic human story. It happens every time we start a new age. It happened when Galileo fought a religious establishment with a telescope, George Washington fought a political establishment with a musket, Steve Jobs fought an economic establishment with an iPod.

We are embracing this history. But note that this is not a book about how to invent tools. Amazing books like _Rework_ and _Zero to One_ already do that. Nor is this a book about the history of invention; _The Innovators_ does that better than I could dream of doing. And if you want brilliant critiques and commentaries of our society, _The Incerto_ and _The Great Degeneration_ are waiting for you.

This book is about pushing us into the Internet Age with a new philosophy that encourages our evolution. Nature thus inspires Techvolution. Notice that gatekeepers don't exist in our world's ecosystems. Evolution doesn't have anyone telling a cheetah she's running too fast, that the ants are too cooperative, or that a camel is too water-efficient. Individual lifeforms adapt to their own problems. There are no middlemen or gatekeepers, just problem solvers. And the problem solvers live on. That's why your choices and power is the root of politics— because you're a lifeform who should be free to adapt like any other.

Human biological adaptions take so long, however, that ours have effectively stopped. We'll never biologically evolve to fly, do advanced calculations, or breathe Martian air. Humanity continues life's evolution with tools. We're basically cyborgs who adapt by upgrading our tools to the latest problem in transportation, calculation, and nutrition. Hold a spear then a gun, an abacus then a calculator, an airplane joystick then a space ship joystick, and you're a different and more powerful cyborg each time.

Nonetheless, our problem solving is held back when gatekeepers of a bygone age hold back civilization's upgrades. This is the equivalent of Blockbuster getting to write rules to keep us renting DVDs instead of saving time and money with YouTube and Netflix; basically, the opposite of evolution.

This classic battle between good and evil fills ours stories from Greek Mythology to Shakespeare. Today the most famous story is Star Wars, so I use it in this book. Star Wars is about a galaxy with an all-powerful energy field called the Force. Luke Skywalker's Jedi warriors' harness "the light side" to help others. Darth Vader's evil Sith lords' harness "the dark side" to help themselves and hurt all who oppose them.

In our world, we call our protagonists "trailblazers". But we don't have a political name for the antagonists. Gatekeepers are often corrupt, but also these people are sometimes just doing their job. Thus, I collectively call the antagonists to our technological evolution Darth Blockbuster: people who actively and knowingly prevent human evolution for the sake of their self-interest.

Since biological adaptions and upgrades are evolution, I've called human technological evolution Techvolution. This book is about inventing Techvolution; the new ruling philosophy empowering Main Street to solve problems with technology as smoothly in human society as other lifeforms do with adaptation and natural selection.

## Taking an Uber, Learning About Collaboration

Have you ever taken an Uber? If you haven't, it's a smartphone app that connects a person needing a ride, with a person willing to drive them. So say Julia needs a lift. She opens up Uber and inputs where she needs to go. Uber assigns Jack to pick her up. Julia and Jack are now connected and can see each other's history, rating, vehicle, and GPS location. All the rules they need to follow, are take care of within the app experience.

Jack drives Julia where she needs to go. They can talk or not, it doesn't matter. Once there, Julia gets out. Uber manages the payment, and Julia and Jack rate each other and then go about their lives.

That's an Uber ride. And if you've ever taken one, you've participated in mass-collaboration as an Internet Age cyborg. Seriously, think about it. Julia needed to get somewhere and Jack helped her get there, and they collaborated using smartphones.

Once upon a time in the Industrial Age, this coordination was done by many managers at taxi, media, and automotive companies. Driver timesheets, dispatch call-centers, complaint resolution, company marketing, vehicle licensing. In the Internet Age, all this paperwork is handled by Uber's (mostly open-source) software. The company Uber still has to staff managers, marketers, executives, and whatnot. But the proportion is far less.

While Darth Taxi-Cab tried to stop Uber in court and government lobbying, it didn't work. The people liked Uber too much. Once people use mass-collaboration, it's too practical to be stopped. It's something to keep in mind while you're reading this book. Our way of life will get better. Once we become player gods who realize their actions, even if just catching a lift, upgrades their civilization to the Internet Age.

Also, notice how similar apps like Door Dash, Uber Eats, Airbnb help "the little guy" use open-source software to share resources once only open to big companies. More apps like these will keep bringing on the era of mass-collaboration between the player gods of Main Street.

With all this in mind, it's time meet the hero of Techvolution. The one who'll defeat evil Darth Blockbuster.

Unsplash protagonists empower anyone to share and use professional-grade images. In the Industrial Age, these images would cost thousands of dollars._

## Nice to Meet You, Stargazer

You're the hero! You're the one who can bring happy lives to Main Street. Do a sit-up and eat a banana, you just upgraded society's heatlh statistics. It's my mission to make you realize you're the player god capable of so much more.

That's why, whoever you are, and wherever you are on this Earth, I'm calling you Stargazer. It's a name in honor of ancestors like Copernicus, Bruno, and Galileo who toppled Darth King by looking up at the stars and asking questions. These giants took on the responsibility to advance civilization and let evolution deal with the naysayers.

You can topple Darth Blockbuster. Not only do you already wield much power with eReadesrs, smartphones, and hi-speed internet, you hold the strongest lever of power ever. From hospital cleaners to internet technical support, from civil engineers to claims adjusters, you are at the frontline—the place that creates political power.

I'm being very serious. Remember when I said, "power is to politics what money is to finance". Well being on the frontline is why you're so important Stargazer. Only you know the exact tools we need to finish the Internet Age upgrade. The daily pain of real work gives you knowledge. Knowledge makes you powerful—a power Darth Blockbuster will never have. Realize that while you're taking hold of the new levers of power, all the antagonists can do is play defense because they don't want to work for a living.

That's why you, Stargazer, are the hero of Techvolution. That's the way it should be. Average Joes and Janes are always the heroes. Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Neo, and Cinderella were all regular people. Heroes aren't born. They're stargazers, dreamers, believers, and achievers. They become heroes when they step up to defeat the bad guys. I'm like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Morpheus, or the fairy godmother, merely a guide to teaching you how to overcome the villains. So, the time is now, Stargazer, to leave the farm and join the rebellion.

The rebellion I speak of might be different than what automatically comes to mind. It is not a physical revolt. It does not involve rallies, marches, or protests. It's a rebellion of the mind. The Internet Age is held back by Darth Blockbuster and his Death Star rulebook. To earn our happiness, we need to turn you into a Internet Age player god. But to do that, you have to feel the click of "eureka!" I believe in Techvolution, and must have the freedom to evolve humanity to the Internet Age because winning the game is worth fighting for.

## Techvolution Builds on the Past

The world's on your shoulders, Stargazer. But let's take a minute and ease some of the burdens. First off, the world is always on your shoulders. Organizations like "the government" and "the market," say they're going to be there for you, but we all know that's a marketing promise more than a reality. Being a player god means taking extreme ownership of your life because your actions are always the best way to improve your life.

Exercising, saving for a rainy day, helping a customer understand their loan application, buying locally grown produce. These are actions of a player god. And they're not that complicated. So while yes, being a player god is hard, it's also rather straightforward. And many of us are doing it already.

The difference with Techvolution is, we expect ourselves, and each other, to bring on the era of mass-collaboration. Vitally, we demand the freedom to take responsibility for our home and work lives whenever a Sith Lord says helping our society is against the rules.

But none of this means you Stargazer have to re-invent society. We aren't throwing away any philosophy you, or anyone else, may believe in. Old philosophies, Protestant/Catholic, Right/Left among them, will always teach us lessons, help us do our jobs better, and enlighten our personal opinions. The ideals and openness of Progressivism helps bring new peoples into Western culture, while giving a helping hand to those already inside. The practicality and steady hand of Conservatives helps insure our society keeps working and doesn't derail from too much idealism. Moreover, each side has immense undestanding of complex fields like monetary policy, farm regulation, labor relations, and more. This single book can't replace all that knowledge. It would be laughable to suggest it could.

But no one should let the rulebooks of old philosophies determine right and wrong when up against a person's right to evolve on the frontline. Like voting our interests in elections, we the people on the frontline today need the freedom to decide which tool best solves a problem. The right and duty to evolve must trump all other considerations. Today old philosophies should not be our ruling philosophy simply because they weren't created with the Internet Age in mind.

We're already starting to use digital tools to improve our lives. YouTube product reviews. Wikipedia articles. Cutting off cable and using Netflix. But there's so much more to do. By controlling modern tools, the middle-class is starting to take control of society's new levers of power. Wanting to control their lives, instead of chasing Right/Left phantoms, is the rebellion inside our mind we need to establish the Internet Age.

That's why controlling tools is the Nature of all political battles. Whether in galaxies far far away, street fights in parking lots, wars between nations, or your own life. It's why antagonists make new tools against the rules. And why I needed to write a book to remind everyone philosophies and rules are supposed empower player gods to push human evolution, not get in its way. But since many rules stall the Internet Age upgrade Stargazer, we must pack our bags, rally our friends, and get ready for a fight. It's time to blow up a Death Star.

_Isn't this the person you'd want playing your game of civilzation? A regular person using a modern tool to improve his life, increase his power, and improve his society. And once we've done our daily work, we can play basketball, watch a movie, or do whatever else we want. Just we shouldn't chase phantom communists or fascists. We're better off sealing that drafty window._

# ACT TWO - BLOWING UP THE DEATH STAR

## When Rules Are In Our way, We Use Evolution to Defeat Them

Life's been evolving for billions of years. Humanity continues life's evolution by creating technology. We develop new and better tools in stages like the Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Industrial Age. Unfortunately, transitioning between stages is hard. Human nature being what it is, the powers of the old age hold back the modern era. Since we've entered the Internet Age in 1970, Darth Blockbuster has continuously defended his mechanical tools by making digital tools against the rules.

Some examples. In the 1970s, AT&T defended its telephone monopoly by successfully lobbying the American government to ban internet modems. In 1984, the broadcast television industry tried to ban video cassette recorders (VCRs) and only lost by one vote in the Supreme Court. In 2001, the music industry defended compact discs (CDs) by successfully suing Napster for giving people digital songs. It's currently illegal for factory farm workers to post pictures of their workplace. Likewise, Tesla, Uber, Airbnb's most significant competition has been in the courtroom. Throughout society, antagonists have found rules to keep people using Industrial Age tools.

City by-laws, industry certifications, insurance regulations, labour laws, government lobbys full of lobbyists, the mountains of red-tape; the endless pages of todays rulebook is our society's Death Star because Darth Blockbuster uses it to prevent new and better technology reaching the frontline. But before you face Darth Blockbuster and blow up his superweapon, Stargazer, you must learn what weapons you have at your disposal. The most formidable? The all-powerful energy field inside every lifeform. No, not the Force. I'm talking about evolution.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zD578MutMAk&list=PL4E3463842B01E133&index=14

_I don't want to personify Darth Blockbuster. But here's an ad for an online investment brokerage. I have no idea if they're any good or not, but the ad displays the scenario that makes a person think "how can I stop this change from happening" and hence become an antagonist. Once typical and esteemed positions like the "hard hitting reporter", the "hard-selling real-estate agent", and the "town video rental store" have or are facing this scenario. Making new tools, and empowering Main Street with a new philosophy, is how we overcome this selfish—albeit understandable—side of human nature._

## The Magic of Evolution - How Evolution Works

Evolution is life's secret weapon. It empowers life by giving every new lifeform a slightly different variation. With variations, life can continually test for environmental changes in things like water levels, temperature, and food supply. These changes create daily frontline problems like being cold or hot, hungry or slow. The variations that can't adapt a solution die off, and the fittest survive. This natural selection finds which lifeforms are best adapted to survive on Earth as it is.

Evolution works so well because it creates biodiversity. Biodiversity means more lifeforms are probing the environment for changes. The more lifeforms feel the pain of frontline problems, the sooner life can adapt a solution.

Evolution may not be the Force, but it's positively magical. In tune with Nature's own special rhyme and reason, evolution turned a lifeless planet into an oasis of many different ecosystems. The big drawback is time. Biological variations can take millions of years to respond to environmental changes. Think of the poor polar bears. They'll never understand why Arctic ice isn't reforming as massively each year. And even if they could, no lifeform can proactively change their biology.

In contrast, humanity can change—not our biology, but our "cyborgology," if you will. We have the power to feel frontline pain, reflect on its causes, and create a new tool to overcome the problem (hopefully we can do this in time to save the polar bears). That's why you are so important Stargazer, your daily real-life problems are the environment our civilization's tools are supposed to solve. Don't be shy about accepting this; making you happy evolves life on Earth. The game of civlization is the game of life.

Techvolution is, therefore, intentional evolution. It's a more advanced and quicker way to adapt that isn't a magical mystery, as natural evolution is to polar bears, but is instead something we can understand. The question is, what drives us to become player gods who choose to evolve life on Earth?

## The Majic of Techvolution - How human techvolution works

We call someone a _genius_ when he or she uses existing technology to make a new tool. Happily, these trailblazing protagonsts are self-motivated, and we already celebrate their intellect and innovations. But innovation isn't the only step toward Techvolution. We only truly evolve when regular people choose to use a new tool.

For example, think of computers. Before they could change the world, people needed to learn to type. That's not so easy. In fact, when stuffy Xerox execs (all males) saw the world's first personal computer in 1977—the Xerox Alto—they refused to use it. The photocopier was the future of office work they said; and besides "typing was women's work". Happily, many Alto engineers fled to Apple and helped invent the MacIntosh. The point is if everyone refused to learn to type, computers would be useless. Society only upgrades when individuals decide to learn how to use a tool and integrate it into their lifestyles.

So, what trick does Nature play on extras to reach for new tools when they would be risking Darth Blockbuster's, or in this case Darth Photocopier's, wrath? The answer is a force found within us all.

Unlike evolution, the trick is not actually akin to magic. We, humans, understand we're dropping one tool and familiarizing ourselves with another, like when swapping out typewriters for personal computers. Yet there's still something wonderfully mystical about choosing to leave one's comfort zone to learn a new cyborgolgy. I call it majic; it's pronounced like magic, but spelled differently to note a critical difference: majic is the free choice of a regular person to proactively and intentionally evolve, even if they don't fully understand how they're upgrading civilization. Majic encompasses our yearning to explore, to learn, to grow, to live to our fullest potential.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(57.50% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/KeenAmpleHusky' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p> <a href="https://gfycat.com/keenamplehusky">via Gfycat</a></p>
_There's magic and majic. Both are cool, but one's fake and the other is actual creation. This is truly majical._

Typically, we underappreciate how cool it is to learn new tools. But every time we try, we're like a drowning desert fox wearing fins and goggles, yelling out, "I'm getting better!" as he fulfills his dream of learning to swim. Pushing our boundaries is what life is all about. It's majic that keeps us jumping back into the water and out of our comfort zone. It's the majical joy of overcoming obstacles, learning new skills, starting over, that keeps us playing the game of civilization.

Techvolution is the ruling philosophy that encourages extras to "majically" bond with any tool they want so they can solve frontline problems as player gods. Yet what do we do when the Death Star says it's wrong?

**Majic**: The natural inclination of a person to learn, use, and hold new tools to increase their natural abilities. Majic inspires people to become player gods who solve frontline problems and thereby help humanity win the game of civilization. A majician teaches themselves, or other people, new tools.

_Charles Darwin famous finches. These birds are adapted to eat one type of food like bugs, seeds, or nuts. After years of study, Darwin explained the differences using his theory of evolution (1859). Humanity mimics evolution by inventing and using new tools. Since we can drop and pick up tools, we can evolve so much faster than other lifeforms. It's majic that keep us evolving._

- Note: Majić is my family name. I lucked out because it reads like "magic" in English. It may seem egotistical to coin "majic" as a term here, but I couldn't think of a better work (I swear). Primarily, the use of "majic" pays tribute to my parents. If you've liked this book so far, you'll know why.

- Sticking it to my personal Darth Blockbuster makes me smile too.

## Using Majic to Filter the Rules

Despite our problems with our current philosophy, society always needs one philosophy that reigns above the rest. We use a ruling philosophy to create the ground rules that glue us all together. Without a ruling philosophy, there would be no player god. The game of civilization would be a story of chaos.

Darth Blockbuster uses the Industrial Ages ruling philosophy to write rules to keep the tools he commands, and therefore himself, in power. Corporate manuals, university "academic standard" guidelines, social justice blogs are among the pages of his Death Star that's working so hard to fight off the Internet Age. These rules interfere with regular people's majically bonding with new tools. But how can you tell if a rule is good or bad? How can a regular person pinpoint a rulebook as a Death Star? Darth Blockbuster doesn't tell people he's Darth Blockbuster. Instead, he says he's the prince or the executive. Are these people genuine authority figures in society, or antagonists protecting their paychecks?

It's essential to filter out the good from the bad rules throughout our everyday lives. It takes practice, and it demands cultivating our integrity and inner truths. Yet it's a struggle that's been taking place for centuries. As an example, you needn't look further than this story of a Maryland farm boy named Frederick, who was born approximately two centuries ago.

===

Our story is about a Maryland farm boy named Frederick using tools to overcome ignorance. His farm is one of those you might have seen on shows like _Little House on the Prairie_. Salt of the earth farmers raising crops and families in 19th century rural America. No internet, no school systems, not much to learn but how to survive with your hands and the fortune God gave you.

Frederick worked the fields with his mother. It was hard labor of course, there weren't many machines around, so he had to work hard, for himself and his mother.

In a few years, Frederick was sent to work with a relative in Baltimore. The house was large, and the young family could use help cleaning, shopping, doing chores. It made his mother happy he wouldn't sweat so much, yet Frederick was a farmer and unsure of the big city.

The patriarch of the house was named Hugh. He wasn't around much. His new wife Sophia was. She was a foreigner used to colder climates who didn't know many people yet, so she stayed in a lot. Sophia was nice and treated Frederick nicely too. Not as a farmer, but as an interesting person. She made Frederick feel at ease.

One day, Sophia handed Frederick a list of items to pick up from the store. Frederick's eyes looked down, his shoulders slouched, like a dog who disappointed its masters. Frederick mumbled, "I can't read."

"My God, well that won't do!" Sophia responded, then continued "Reading is good. How else can a person give and receive information from... from... the world! I'll teach you; we'll do it together." So, Sophia taught Frederick to read. Just a few weeks, and he got the basics. Sophia was a majician everyday, and was overjoyed.

Frederick even more so! Finally, all those markings in the store, on street corners, in books, in newspapers, in the Holy Bible, mean something, a new world! Go left, turn right, open, closed, discounted, welcome, and Salvation, all words that open a new world.

Now Frederick danced to the store, he whisked himself to do his chores, because he was learning to read a little more every day. He loved how the world kept getting bigger, and information kept pouring in.

One day Hugh came home early. He saw Sophia and Frederick reading at the dinner table. Hugh walked into the room. "Boy, get out, and wait in the hallway. Face the wall."

Frederick got out, went outside, and faced the wall. Seconds turned to minutes. Frederick rolled the newspaper in his hands tighter. He didn't want to go back to the farm. But even more, he didn't want his angel to get in trouble.

Inside the room, Sophia was curious, "What is it?." Hugh responded "This isn't Ohio... Darling you can't do that. We could get in a lot of trouble. You can't teach them to read."

Sophia responded "everyone learns to read in Ohio."

Hugh takes a seat. "This isn't a free State. He is a slave. What do you think happens when slaves read? Don't you think they'll start thinking?" Sophia's eyes went wide. Hugh continued "It's against the rules to teach a slave to read... now teach the boy."

As Frederick heard the hallway door open, he straightens up, and grips his newspaper.

Sophia says "Turn around."

Frederick does, and looks at his angel, the one who talked with him like he was a person. And she looked back and only saw _her boy_.

Sophia slapped the newspaper from her boy's hand. He didn't let go. She slapped again, and again and again. Each slap hurt more than a dozen whips on his scarred back.

She slapped, and slapped, and slapped, and slapped. Sophia was told her (new) society's ruling philosophy. Now she knows what evil is and she will not do it. She will use the Death Star. Sophia then and there became a demon protector of vile racism to justify human slavery.

Frederick's world shutdown again. The one white person ignorant enough to treat him like a person, was now an educated convert to the rules that put him into chains. Physical chains if needed, but evil prefers mental chains of ignorance; they stay on so much easier.

Weeks later Frederick was still in despair. His daily routine was the same. Yet, working under demonic masters is just different. He didn't dance to the store, he didn't whisk to do his chores, and he never saw Sophia smile again. Demons are never happy because they're always on guard.

One day while doing his chores, Frederick saw a newspaper, the avenue to knowledge whose path Frederick was once on. He looked at the markings, saw some words he knew, and one word he didn't. Yet he still stared at it. Why?

The answer slapped him harder than the demon ever did, he read the words "The Free States in the North." He heard the word freedom before, but he didn't know freedom was a real place.

A shockwave went through him when he realized if slavery was a place, then so must freedom be a place too. Frederick realized he could break chains! Because ignorance was always his demon, and knowledge was always his angelic lever of power. And he fought ignorance, and received knowledge, whenever he read.

So, Frederick taught himself to read. He practiced with innocently "ignorant" white kids on the streets. He practiced reading items at the grocery store. He practiced on every street sign. And he practiced every time he was at the Baltimore dock; did you hear me Stargazer, the dock I said, you know the place, where ships will take you anywhere in the world. If you can read the schedule.

One day Sophia waited for her boy to return. But the boy died when the man Frederick Douglass walked onto the ship headed north to freedom. The man knew the exact time, place, and fare he needed to get on. He read it, himself, on the schedule. Reading opened the world to Frederick, and now the free world was opened to him.

The story gets better. Frederick Douglass wasn't happy just reading, he becomes a world famous orator and writer whose actions changed the game of civilization. In a world with no radio, video, or telephones, he travels the Northern States and Europe telling everyone the truth about slavery. When the American Civil War (1861-1865) broke out, his books helped Britain reject recognizing the South, and thus deprived it of much needed support. The irony of a slave educating people about slavery, and thereby helping to end slavery, is the cherry on top of this great story.

_This is a diagram of the story. A technology comes with a philosophy. And each philosophy has its protagonists. The people are in the middle. If they stay as extras, antagonists win. If we become player gods, protagonists win._

===

Frederick Douglass was a true Jedi Master. His exceptional bravery, persistence, and intelligence helped to showcase humanity's endless potential. He became a protagonist who convinced extras to become player gods and upgrade their society's ruling philosophy against vile racism. His books were levers of power that changed the world. The big lesson we learn Stargazer is how to use majic to tell the difference between good and evil rules.

Sophia taught Douglass to read. She wasn't told to. She did it because we love teaching our chosen tools, whether they're pen and paper, new apps, or how to tape drywall. It's as natural to spread our cyborgology, as it is for a species to propagate their biology.

When a magician makes a playing card disappear, we smile in awe and childish wonder. That's cool, but nothing new was created, so we soon lose our joy. However, when a majician connects someone with typing, programming, or reading, they've similarly performed something awesome. They've upgraded someone's cyborgology, helped them solve problems better, and effectively created a new and improved person. This makes us smile for a long time. In short, majic is Nature's long-lasting dopamine fix to motivate us to keep playing the game of civilization.

Yet human-made rules _sometimes_ say upgrading to a new tool is wrong. Medieval parishioners couldn't read a science book, French peasant farmers couldn't have a musket, a 1990's kid couldn't download a digital song. Today millions of tired working moms can't telecommute.

Rather... the tired mothers can, they all have high-speed internet and home computers, but they don't. The question is: why not?

There is no easy answer. Remember in no story does anyone ever say they're evil. Society's rulebook will never call itself a Death Star. The lesson Stargazer is it'll never be easy to know the difference between good and bad rules. Anyone can proclaim rules. Even kids on the playground can say "only tall kids can play," and others, based on personality, will obey or rebel.

Majic is thus our best judge of the rules. Majic feels right. It naturally makes us smile. It improves us and our way of life. From teaching a kid to walk, to teaching a grandmother to "Skype in" and watch her grandkid's first steps, teaching and learning new tools open our hearts because it turns us into player gods who improve ourselves and our civilization. It's why we build things in civilization computer games; no game is about holding back upgrades.

So, when you're teaching or learning a new tool and someone steps in your way with a rule, ask yourself if you feel majiccal happy for fixing a problem, and if you do, ask the rule maker why he doesn't. Perhaps there's a good reason. But keep Sophia in mind. Performing majic made her feel good, while following the rules only made her feel safe. The Death Star operates by fear; majic by joy.

Safety is fleeting Stargazer. Human rules are created by hierarchies, which topple with every new technological age. Thus all rulebooks eventually expire. Majic never will. It always was, and always will be, in our souls as we play the game of civilization. Majic is how we naturally test human rulebooks. Electricity, the microchip, the iPhone were all made by people who broke the rules. Yet we celebrate their innovators Nikola Tesla, Robert Noyce, Steve Jobs because they invented new tools that let us feel and spread majic today.

Ignore majic at your peril. Sophia gave one of our greatest writers and orators his start. Yet she lived a miserable life watching him achieve greatness because she broke the rules. Living as an unhappy extra is the inevitable punishment to everyone who ignores the joy of learning new skills and tools of a player god.

It's a lesson for us to take in when we're stuck in traffic, getting disciplined from eight different bosses, or doing whatever else is giving us such unhappy lives. We're unhappy because we're extras of the Industrial Age. We aren't challenging ourselves, teaching each other, or helping our civilization upgrade to the Internet Age. This is why we need Techvolution. A modern philosophy that says being a player god is fun, and holding back majic is wrong.

_The joy of majic. This YouTuber learns new skills then posts videos of his experience. Look how happy he is once he finally does it. We're unhappy today because our workplaces still treat employees like cogs in the era of mass-production. In the Internet Age we all should be learning new tools to improve things on the frontline in an era of mass-collaboration. If someone holds back majic at work, it's a good sign they're the ones with the problem._

## Now We Know the Difference Between Good and Bad, It's Time to Use It

Stargazer, you're not Frederick Douglass. You're not enslaved. You're not beaten. You're not being chased. But that doesn't mean we should be happy with our lives any more than Douglass should have been content with his personal freedom. Our society needs player gods to solve today's frontline problems. That means you have to follow majic, to help us win the game by grabbing hold of the Internet Age levers of power Darth Blockbuster doesn't want you to have.

One big problem arises. Sometimes we feel the wrong majic, and therefore don't see, nevermind fight for, the levers of power. Darth Blockbuster knows we love new and interesting technology. So he co-opts majic with an unnnatural, and anti-evolutionary force. One I call dark majic.

## Dark Majic Masks

In Nature there are continual adaptations of existing lifeforms, and then sometimes entirely new lifeforms. In Techvolution, this is the difference between upgraded technology and an entirely new tool.

Upgrading a technology, such as going from sedans to SUVs, VHS to DVD's, is a small change. While each product is different technologically, they do the same job. At the end of the day their users have the same powers, and are thus the same cyborgs. The point is, new technology doesn't start a political battle—the Death Star isn't fired up so to speak.

But when we've upgraded enough technologies, like microchips, touchscreens, batteries, and Wi-Fi, a protagonist can unlock a new tool; like smartphones. New tools solve problems in a new way. And this is a big deal.

![New Tool Creation](/img\diagrams\techvolution-new-tool-creation-pc-s.png)
_New technology is continually invented. When enough separate technology is invented, a new tools is created._

Because new tools prompt a question: who controls it? After all, whoever does is more powerful. While the game of civilization is the struggle to overcome problems by upgrading technology and inventing new tools, politics is about the battle to control them. The people with the old tool fight to retain their power. While the inventors, innovators, and majicians imagine a new society that shares it.

Darth Blockbuster is willing to use society's rulebook to suppress new tools. But lawsuits, firings, lobbying, and other techniques take time and money. It's better for the antagnoists if Main Street's love of majic is misdirected for a love of old technology the antagonists still control. For example, muscle cars today keep customers away from Tesla with techniques like mass advertising, fancy auto shows, and spectacular chromes plated V8 power! Tesla's are a new tool because they can be fueled using renewable energy. With a Tesla Solar Roof, they can even be fueled with ones's own power. But people are prevented from seeing this majical potential by antagonists anti-evolution techniques that I call "dark majic."

Dark majic is the pomp, pagantry, and spectacle that surrounds today's Industrial Age tools, like insurance ads, car commercials, auto shows, and credit car rewards. This fake majic is a more insidious technique to prevent upgrades. It gives people the joy of learning about technology, but it doesn't upgrade their cyborogolgy, and thus stalls our society in the game of civilization. To destroy the Death Star Stargazer, we have to learn to ignore evil dark majic.

**Dark majic**: Methods and techniques to keep a person using an old tool. Dark majic gives regular people a fake sense of joy and accomplisment, so they don't upgrade their cyborgology and become player gods. A dark majician tricks people into being extras.

## Dark Majic

I've processed about 10,000 car accident insurance claims. While claims gets quite emotional sometimes, the task is straightforward. Drivers call a call center, claim adjusters (me) ask them questions to get them back on the road. The job is mostly filling out paperwork. One question showcased how deep our society can fall for dark majic.

When I'd ask customers their car's color, I'd often hear something like "it's midnight summer blue". Being somewhat a jokster, I'd play around and ask "you sure it wasn't sunrise winter blue?". And the customer would always replay with something like "No, it's the midnight summer. I'm positive."

My chuckle would turn into amazement when I'd ask about the other car. I'd almost always be told "I have no idea." It was a pain because my job was to get this information. But even though they'd were just in a car accident together, customers usually didn't remember a thing about the other car. I mean nothing. Not the make, model, color, not even if it was a sedan or SUV. When a driver hit a horse, they'd remember what they hit, but a car? Usually I'd have to write "unknown" and move on.

We think our vehicles are so unique and special. It's not a car, it's "The original Sports Activity Vehicle®: a fearless leader and stylish benchmark. A BMW x5Drive50i, with Phytonic Blue Metallic paint". I'm not kidding. People would talk like that. And not know a thing about the other car.

And that's dark majic. Because a person living in 2020, is acting like it's 1960; when cars were new and majical. Majical because they upgraded people used to walking around or waiting for buses with faster transportation. Buying cars for the first time meant these new cyborgs could happily cruise the roads, take family road trips, visit far away friends. Cars was stunningly fast means of transportation, one that mimicks us today getting hi-speed internet for the first time.

But today isn't 1969, you're not in _Grease_, or _American Graffiti_, or _Rebel Without a Cause_.

_Professional driver on a closed course. And still a gas car, with four wheels, probably stuck in traffic._

The truth is cars are all so similar today, few stand out. Because to civilization in 2020, what makes a car special is it's reliability, how well a mechanic maintains it, how good your dealer treated you. The frills are interesting, enjoyable, but in the end don't really matter. You're the same cyborg with almost any car. My customers admitted as much, because after an accident, what they wanted most of all was a rental car. Fancy features and made up colors didn't matter; they just needed to get around to get on with their lives. Dark majic turns us into introcets, who think we're participating in the game of civilization as important player gods, but we're really just distracted extras living in the past.

The Industrial Age powers want to distract us. To be a happy community again, Main Street has to wake-up to dark majic and survive the Death Star. Let's see how we did against Darth Blockbuster himself.

## Darth Blockbuster Uses Dark Majic and the Death Star

Industrial Age industries use dark majic to keep their customers attached to an aging product. Today's Hollywood is a great example. But Tinseltown didn't start out that way. In the 1930s and 40s, master storytellers like Samual Goldwyn, David O. Selnick, and Irving Thalberg headed studios that used new projector, sound, and film technology to make movies a worldwide sensation. Like Steve Jobs created a world of apps that has us fixated on our phones, early Hollywood's Studio System created a world of stories that glued people to their theatre seats in what was soon called "The Golden Age of Cinema".

Over the next decades things changed. Television came in 1948, which hurt movie theatres. Worst, was the government (foolishly) made a rule banning studios from owning, or even collaborating with, movie theatres—which broke up the studio system that worked so well. By the 1970s the movie industry was hurting. It was good movies like The Godfather (1972), Jaws (1975), Star Wars (1977) that brought some people back to the theatre.

By this time the movies were no longer run by master storytellers but by businessman obsessed with mass-production. The industry lost it's ability to tell original stories. Instead, they made sequels, remakes, and franchises. Each new release had to use more rauchiness, special effects, and celebrities to attract attention. Movie attendence didn't rise in the 1980s and 90s. But studios didn't care. They were making their money outside the theatre.

I'll let screen legend John Wayne explain it:

  > All the real motion picture people have always made family pictures. But the downbeats and the so-called intelligentsia got in when the government stupidly split up the production companies and the theaters. The old giants like Mayer, Thalberg, even Harry Cohn, despite the fact that personally I couldn't stand him—were good for this industry. Now the goddamned stock manipulators have taken over. They don't know a goddamned thing about making movies. They make something dirty, and it makes money, and they say, 'Jesus, let's make one a little dirtier, maybe it'll make more money.' And now even the bankers are getting their noses into it

This was the time that the entertainment industry took VCRs to court and lost. As the public kept buying home video tapes, the public wanted to watch more content on demand. Enter Blockbuster. Blockbuster rose to VHS rental dominace by using bar-codes to keep track of thousands of videos—which let them carry far more titles, and be timely enough to charge late-fees. VHS rental business was so good, business centric Hollywood started to use theatres release to hype up their movies rental business.

Then came the DVD and flatscreen televisions came (1999). Hollywood's businessman were gleeful. As the public crazed over home theatres, they bought billions of DVDs and happily watched their favorite stories at home. In fact, despite jacked up popcorn prices, many theatres chains went bankrupt in the 1990s. Hollywood didn't care; they kept making spectular and raunchy franchies and remakes to sell more DVDs.

Fundamentally speaking, movie theatres and home theatres, are technologically the same; both gates. A customer of both still needs to drive to a watch a film reel or DVD. And here was the sweet spot of the Industrial Age powers. The industry could use digital technology to lower the costs of mass-production, while still charging premium prices required for a physical product.

The sweetspot wasn't going to last. Because true to the game of civiization, technology kept getting better once hi-speed internet (2004) finally came to Main Street. Now the public could share in the benefits of the Internet Age; home internet streaming was finally possible. And predictably a new tool asked a huge political question, who controls internet streaming?

![Techvolution battle](/img\diagrams\techvolution-battle.png)

I was a theatre usher/projectionist back then and saw it all first hand. Many movies were great, but most were bland: comedies, tradegies, dramas, suspense, all usually fell flat. Theatres were over-priced and often empty. Customers were unhappy and told me so. The industry didn't care. They gave themselves lavish paychecks, banquets, and award shows. Any consideration of the upgrading their customers to the Internet Age was non-existant.

The industry wasn't going to throw away the DVD. Instead, they doubledowned on it. Twice! They made HD-DVD and Blu-Ray (2006). They increased the dark majic of marketing, special effects, and celebrity culture. The Hollywood heirarchy was happy the way things were. Digital technology was their lever of power.

In swoops today's internet Jedi on an ethernet chandlier. Unknown and unpaid technologists created BitTorrent sites (2008), that although filled with computer viruses, bad picture quality, and poorly designed user interfaces, gave regular people movies on the internet. With the lever of power in both hands, here, the dark majic of DVDs, faced off against the majic of internet streaming.

A decade before the music industry was in the same spot. Record stores and CD sales died when customers got the internet and flocked to torrent sites like Napster. Music executives tried—and failed miserably—to make their own online music platform. When the great Steve Jobs created iTunes to help save the music industry, they still didn't want to share their power over the music business. Jobs said this about his experience, "I've never spent so much of my time trying to convince people [music executives] to do the right thing for themselves". But Eventually Jobs got them on board, and the iPod, iTunes, and AppleMusic is of course history.

The movie industry rejected the lesson of Napster. Ever notice how online movies don't include opening credits, red-carpet interviews, and political charged speeches. When the public controlled the lever of power, the first thing they did was erase this filler because its useless dark majic. When in control of their stories, the public just downloads the simple majic of a new story.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/PleasantRegularGibbon' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

_Majic versus dark majic, or modern movies versus premium television._

When DVDs and dark majic lost out to the majic of streaming, the industry fired up the Death Star. The same public who bought billions of dollars on DVDs and merchanise. That was paying 800 million a year in DVD late fees. That created fan clubs and flocked to comic-cons; was declared evil. The movie industry put FBI warnings on their products, lobbyied government for harsh punishments, and demanded the public feel ashamed for not buying DVDs anymore. Customers were sued, threats of lawsuits were mailed out. The industry refused to evolve, and so called their own customers disloyal thieves.

And here was born Darth Blockbuster. Hollywood leaders were actively and knowingly trying to force humanity to keep using his old tools in our cyborgology. Rather than gluing us in our seats with good stories, Hollywood he was trying to glue DVDs onto our hands with Blue-ray marketing hype and lawsuits. But before we find if the villian could save the DVD (I know you know the answer, but indulge me), let's take a short break.

![Frontline movies full](/img\sketches\frontline-movies-full.jpg )
_Today, most movies stink, and most theatres are dead. That's you Stargazer, looking at the frontline after removing the dark majic mask that had you watching pompeous banquets giving out awards to movies you've likely not even seen._

# Intermission

Intermissions are a good time to stretch our legs, buy a snack, and also ask some questions about the story so far. Here, I want to define more terms, characters, and emphasize how many of our problems are caused by refusing to upgrade our philosophy so that we the people see modern tools as our lever of power to improve our world and make us happy.

## Recap

The game of civilization never stops. It goes on forever because it's the game of life; evolve or die. Thus, we're always that person on Main Street trying to figure out what's best for ourselves while trying to help our society prosper. I think we all try our best. We try to educate ourselves, eat healthy, or join movements like sustainable agriculture and renewable energy.

We're under pressure because the game of life always wants better technology. So, organizations like Tesla aren't a "company", it's how protagonists and some player gods are upgrading our transportation system. Literally, imagine a player pressing "upgrade" and that's what Tesla is to our society. We did the same thing when moving our factories from steam power to electricity. It's just so hard to see when we're on Main Street because we're the ones evolving.

That's good news, because even though human evolution is (currently) hard to see, we're still nonetheless playing the game. We simply have a huge problem—we're running out of time. Western Civilization peaked in the Industrial Age, and we haven't updated our ruling philosophy to the Internet Age. Still obessed with the era of mass-production, we've been managing the digitization of our society using ideas meant to encourage the industrialziation of our society.

Today we still measure our success by GDP growth, employment numbers, Dow Jones Industrial Average, Union membership rates. But, these stats don't tell us anything about us specifically; if we have more savings every month, how well our infrastructure is maintained, if we're having less heart attacks, or in general if we're living happier lives.

The Internet Age gives us the power to start measuring our happiness. Before we do that, we have to finish our upgrade to the Internet Age with the "click" of a new philosophy that says improving our lives is the most important rule—to get there we need many more player gods on Main Street.

![US-VMT-per-capita](/img\diagrams\US-VMT-per-capita.png)
_You'll never hear this stat on CNBC, but it means so much wasted times and money. It's a number we'll be talking much about in the Internet Age._

## The Rulebook

The rulebook is what governs everyday life. Since entering the Internet Age our rulebook has kept growing. Government regulations have shot up, political correctness is enforced in campsus and boardrooms, barbers need government licenses, office workers study years to get absurd ceritfications, and think of this, business lobbysists didn't even exist in 1969, now many people think they run our governments.

Our rulebook is huge, and you're probably used to it be over your head. We all sign loan contracts, terms of service, credit card agreements without reading them. We live under so many by-laws, regulations, and laws nobody knows how many. We also buy products filled with so many copyrights, trademarks, patents it's hard to understand how much of the item we own. We live under the jurisdiction of a very big rulebook. But big isn't always bad; until size is used against us.

![old philosophy in a new world](/img\diagrams\GWRegStudies-PagesPublishedinFederalRegister-6.12.19.png)
_Federal government regulations. An example of our rulebook's growth_

## The Death Star

A big rulebook makes our rules so convoluted they become open to interpretation. Today, it's lawyers who benefit most. They interpret laws and argue for one side in a dispute, thus have the power to decide winner and loser. But big is still not automatically a Death Star.

It became one when Industrial Age powers wanted to keep themselves in power. Far removed from the original industrialists, they relied on controlling existing levers of power; not inventing new ones. They wanted the era of mass-production to never end. This scene from Mad Men, taking place in 1960, shows it well.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKcneQ6N50Q&feature=youtu.be&t=50

You can see this same conversation at Chrysler, Levi's, Gilette Razers, Universal Pictures and many other once upon a time cutting edge companies. After the Industrial Age ended they wanted to keep the good times going. To do so the juniors of this world, with no idea how to make anything new, had to up their mad men dark majic show. And when that didn't work—a large, confusing, and ever growing rulebook became their superweapon to defend their gates against new technology.

Only these companies had the money to buy the lawyers who could intepret the growing rulebook in their favour. Hence forth, the large rulebook of society became a Death Star to the Internet Age. And "junior" became Darth Blockbuster, who held back evolution for his self-interest, not caring it make is live ever unhappier lives.

## Polar Bears in the Amazon

The era of mass-production is over. But politicians went along with Darth Blockbuster's antagonism. Neither Left of Right could understand all the possibilities of digital technology to help all of society prosper—as Progressives dream—and also force people to better themselves—as Conservatives demand.

Unable to evolve, our society kept building mass-producing the past and using ever more dark majic to keep people from noticing. Thus, to improve education we kept putting up more fancy colleges, to speed up transportation we built more roads, to make people "happy", we built more suburban homes. The Woodstock 1969 lifestyle went global to keep Industrial Age production lines pumping out their one size fits all products.

SUBURBIA
_Guess where these pictures were taken. You can't! That's unusual in our history and in Nature._

If anyone would see a camel drinking from the Great Lakes, eagles flying inside a cave system, or polar bears swimming in the Amazon, we'd stop and wonder; "why are these biologies here?". Likewise, when we see the same modes of transportation, working hours, habitation structures, power plants—in general the same cyborgologies in Boston and Phoenix, we should know understand something is gravely wrong. Different geographies, demographics, weather have different problems and thus give lifeforms custom biologies; and so it should give custom cyborgologies.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(54.69% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/BriefPersonalAlleycat' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p> <a href="https://gfycat.com/briefpersonalalleycat">via Gfycat</a></p>

If you're asking how our cyborgologies should evolve, I don't know. That's your choice. It's up to free lifeforms to adapt. I do know an archeologist digging us up, would have a heck of time telling the difference between Miami and Toronto, or San Diego and Halifax lifestyles. We have none of the splendid diveristy of life in Nature, the ancient world, or Middle-Earth (a wonderful world to look forward to in the era of mass-collaboration).

And that's why we're unhappy. We're forced to live a generic lifestyle, unfree to adapt our housing, work schedules, transportation methods, food supply etc. to our the problems of our environment—like a camel trying to live in the Amazon.

It's expensive for a lifeform to live outside of its ecosystem. That's why our politicians, despite disagreeing on everything else, have agreed to keeping borrow more money. They want to keep the Industrial Age, the era of mass-production, and their ruling philosophy, alive. It's also why we extras owe so much money.

In short, can you imagine all the debt a polar bear would need to live in the Sahara? You don't have to, just look down.

![Government debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_debt#/media/File:Consumer_and_Government_Debt_as_a_%_of_GDP.png)
_Industrial Age tools like suburban houses, gas cars, and junk food are too generic to give a return on their investment. We borrow to avoid doing the hard work of finding more efficient ways of living and working in the era of mass-collaboration._

## Ideologues Doesn't Care About Evolution

Ruling philosophies are very powerful. They can make strong believers of people who sometimes have a hard time applying their philosophy to the real-world. One example is Lysenkoism. This was a pseudo-science in the Soviet Union that assumed our genes inherit learned traits. So for example, if you lived in a hot climate, your genes would morph to sweat more.

Darwin said the opposite. He said said our genes are set in stone and it's the fittest who survive. Soviets didn't want to believe that because it sounded like elitism; which their communist ideology said was unnatural. The result was Soviet genetic research didn't exist, Soviet agriculture didn't get better seeds, and thousands of Soviet biologists were sent to labour camps because they asked too many questions.

Ofcourse we can "morph" ourselves, but only cyborgologically. To be free to evolve though, we must replace our ruling philosophy. Progressive and Conservative won't go easy. Their ideologues don't know—or care—about upgrading to the Interner Age. Even now they're fighting to stay alive.

These fights get very serious—like when Europe set itself aflame in the Thirty Years War fighting for a bygone Medieval Age ruling philosophy. Now we have extremist Progressives and Conservatives blaming each other for our society's problems, and rallying around trigger words, tea-party marches, free speech restrictions, woke culture, toxic campuses and boardrooms, revisionist histories. These misguided people will keep raising tensions, until we click a new philosophy for our new age. Watch out.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(57.50% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/AgileFeminineAlpineroadguidetigerbeetle' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p> <a href="https://gfycat.com/agilefemininealpineroadguidetigerbeetle">via Gfycat</a></p>

## Made In America

How did antagonists stay in business by re-selling the same products? They lowered their labour costs by exporting their factories and calling it profitability.

There are endless pages of economic theory that justify exporting American industry. All of it's bullshit. If lower costs are such a good thing, why aren't trademarks, registered trademarks, copyrights, or patents filed in markets with cheap lawyers? Why aren't executives or marketing departments outsourced? Darth Blockbuster was simply selling off our factories to buy himself more time. China was especially seen as the promised land—the place of the never ending Industrial Age and thus the perfect solution to Darth Blockbuster's problems.

Left and Right politicians agreed. Unable to adapt to the Internet Age, they saw cheap labour as a way to sustain the "American Dream" babyboomer lifestyle they sold to voters. In addition to borrowing money, more free-trade was their answer to Main Street's money problems, even when it meant selling off Main Street.

But replaying bygone ages isn't how humanity wins the game of civilization. We win by constantly evolving technology and ourselves. That's why there's never been a time where the society full of marketers, managers, and economists, defeated the society full of engineers, craftsman, and technicians.

To start winning the game in the Internet Age, Main Street must demand more "Made In America". It's a great sign we're controling our society's new Internet Age levers of power because we're buying each others products. I smile, thinking of all those bakers, tailors, designers, roofers, engineers, repairmen happily working on a new empowered Main Street.

## New and Old Societies As Seen in Celebrities

New technology is already changing our society. By connecting people to the internet, we've given ourselves the power to receive and send information on demand. The gates of newspapers, broadcast television, and weather forecasts are torn down. Now the people decide what they learn, based on what they need to know.

An example of this is celebrities. We'll always celebrate the people we look up to. In the Industrial Age society, our celebrities were often decided for us. The era of mass-production only let a few people make movies, release albums, or get their names in the newspapers.

Internet Age celebrities are different. While we can make fun of Instagram models, silly YouTubers, Twitter trolls, and obscure podcasts, but at least we can follow who we want; which also means we celebrate who we want. Heck with no gates to overcome anyone can be a musician, artists, comedian or "celebrity." Personally, I follow people like Sailing La Vagabonde, Adam Savage’s Tested, The Joe Rogan Experience, Dave 2D, Kirsten Dirksen, Taylor Tries, Dr. Becky, largely because they're real people doing cool stuff who'd never consider themselves celebrities.

The next time you hear "celebritiy" ask yourself if they're one of yours. Modern technology gives you that power.

## Does The World Need to Know

While we should eb celebrating stuff like #madeinamerica, and #walkingtowork, we have to devalue the dark majic of many consumer goods.

That can be hard. While Darth Blockbuster heads a heirarchy. There's lots underlings inside who fight his cause. Dealing with these BMW drivers, junior execs, or agents is sometimes hard. They define success as rising up the ranks. If you're "beneath" them, they assume they're better than you and act like it.

If they ever intimidate you, just press the button below.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random" target="_blank" class="button primary large">The Funny Wakeup Button</a>

It randomly selects a Wikipedia article. With three clicks I got:

- Lorenz Nieberl, a German bobsledder.
- Sandamías, a village in northern Spain with 67 residents.
- Aartsenia arctica, a sea snail.

Anyone can make a Wikipedia article, so someone out there said, "the world needs to know" about this stuff. But, no one has ever thought that about your personal antagonist. You haven't, have you?

Ignore arrogant pricks. They're not even smart enough to realize their collecting and polishing participation trophies for needlessly changing the company logo, or re-writing the unread corporate manual. Now and always, its contributions to win the game of civlization that makes people think; "the worlds needs to know". Today that's whoever grabs the new levers of power and helps upgrade to the Internet Age so we live in the era of mass-collaboration and win the game.

## What's That Collaboration Tool Called

When I worked at a call-center, my customers often had a paper invoice or report. When I told them I needed to see it, they'd usually ask themselves where they could get a scanner or a fax machine.

I'd remind them their smartphone has a great camera—they can just snap a photo and email me. This always sparked a eureka moment; "that's right, I can do that, thanks John!"

That's what I mean by cyborgology and majic. When a new tool is in our hand, it gives us a new ability, and therefore increases our cyborgolgy. But we need to be taught how to use it. We can either learn the majic of new tools ourselves, or a majician can teach us.

While most people know about scanning and faxing, there's still no word for snapping a photo of paperwork. Because this new ability of our cyborgology is still evolving. Cool huh? It's especially cool because we're with how fast computers are getting, we literally growing new tools everyday, and therefore new ways to live; if we grab the levers of power and evolve.

## Levers of Power

In the Industrial Age, when regular people thought of politics, they had to think of ideologies. This was because government policy was society's biggest lever of power. To have any say in what that lever did, Main Street could only support Right or Left.

The Internet Age changes the power dynamic. Now when you think of politics Stargazer, you should not think of ideology, but of apps, websites, and electronics. These are the new levers of power. And, the most important political question of our time is asking "who controls mine?".

The middle-class can start to control their society with water reclaimers, home agriculture, solar panels, and records of communication. Once we believe in Techvolution, we'll be player gods in our minds. But only when we control our own levers of power, will we be player gods in reality.

## The Era of Mass-Collaboration Is Already Seeded

While the antagonists are fighting it, the era of mass-collaboration is already here. We've already seen examples of Uber and Airbnb. But there are also many collaboration projects like Wikipedia too. I included some more below. Not only should you take a minute to try them out, you should sit back and realize what you're doing. Because with no managers, consultants, and timesheets, you can work with others to advance humanity with nothing but a laptop, the internet, and you.

One day soon, your job will likewise require so little travel, stress, and time. And no, you won't lose your job. It's the head-office types, the HR reps, the eight different bosses, the people with no frontline skills who are unneeded in the era of mass-collaboration. That's why they fear the Internet Age so much.

I mean, compare some errors and delayed product releases, to Industrial Age industries like banks, cars, and insurance that get billions in bails outs every generation. All the websites above are very young and inexpensive, but they still put levers of power in your hand. As they improve, they will only increase your control over your slice of the world, which directly increases your political power.

Even with today's limited collaboration tools, Main Street can start working together like this example below.

## The Era of Mass-Collaboration Is Only Waiting for a New Rulebook

Mass-collaboration makes us happy. Our happiness is a sign of a healthy society. The new era is waiting for us all, once we evolve to the Internet Age by clicking a new philosophy and installing a new rulebook. I'll show you a more detailed example.

When we buy new house, we can't wait to move in, bring in our furniture, and start renovations. Soon enough, everyone's putting in decks, pools, fences, sheds, and whatever else we dream up.

Take a second and watch this clip of a player building backyards in the city-builder _Cities: Skylines_.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/ClassicSecretKarakul' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Evolution needs us to buy solar-power roofs, install a Hydroloop water resuser, start a 3D printing business in the garage. These are the new technologies that put levers of power in ours hands. We've already seen how we can connect with each other in the mass-collaboration economy to help solve our—and therefore our society's—problems.

But there's a roadblock; do you know if your home insurance policy covers hail damage to newly installed solar panels? Do you even know where to find out if it does? Do you where to get your local business by-laws, building codes, tax laws?

Even without antagonists, our society's rulebook is so large and dense, we all live under the threat of "not reading the fine-print" and being hit by a code violation, claim denial, warranty rejection, lawsuit, or audit. And what if antagonists want to attack us? It's so easy for anyone with the resources to find "a problem" and use their Death Star to start a lawsuit, find a violation, or lobby government against you.

Technologically speaking there's absolutely no reason for this. How is it that Linux software is worth billions, operates every Android phone, runs most of the internet's servers; and you can download it by pressing this button.

<a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/archive/master.zip" target="_blank" class="button primary large">Instantly Download Billion Dollar Software For Free</a>

But to access our car insurance policy we do what? What does it take to get the blueprints to our home? How many people understand how their mortgage works?

The rules, regulations, contracts, laws, that govern our lives is a complete mystery to most people. And that makes us dependent on people like claims adjusters, building inspectors, mortgage brokers, and lawyers. Giving these people the lever of power to become antagonists.

The truth is, regular people can work as freely as the _Cities: Skylines_ clip above. Like taking an Uber, or renting an Airbnb, open-source software, GPS, smartphones, high-speed internet, AES security protocols, cloud computing, MySQL databases can literally put the power in our hands!

Once we hold Internet Age levers of power, we'll make a rulebook that's friendly and reasonable. We'll still need experts, but this new rulebook will let us check and balance each other so Main Street always understand what we should be doing, lets us ask informed questions if something doesn't make sense, and fight back if we think something is wrong.

This new rulebook will only be a happy reality once Main Street uses Techvolution as our shield and motivation to bring-on the era of mass-collaboration. We'll talk about making the Internet Age rulebook a little later, in Techvolution II: Building the Life Star.

To get people to sign they used BMW driving underlings to sell a confusing rulebook. By the way, the housing crisis was always going to happen. The babyboomer suburban lifestyle is camels trying to live in the Amazon._

## Click

What makes something click in a person's mind? If only we knew. Sadly, we can't decide to cry, scream, or love. We all must wait for a connection. Here's some stand-up that'll probably make you laugh, I'll make a point afterwards.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOiPQ8nqB1s&feature=youtu.be&t=15

Note, it's the extras of the Industrial Age who complain about everything because they're forgotten they can have fun playing the game of civlization.

Here's my point, nobody knows how or why something clicks. However, we do understand when it does—when we can't go back. And could you ever drop Netflix and do back to Blockbuster? What about flipping through encyclopedia books, or calling a taxi-cab? Of course not, and that's a good sign you're already a believer in the Internet Age.

So, lets return to the book and our mission. I want you to drop the era of mass-production and Left/Right politics for Techvolution—a new philosophy that gives you the right and duty to upgrade our civilization to the Internet Age. I want Main Street to spread their power with #debtfreeliving, #byebyedarthblockbuster, #masscollaboration because that's what player gods do when we control our society's levers of power.

# Mid Point

## A Techvolution Battle Scene. Wikipedia vs. Books. Internet Age vs. Industrial Age

Before we return to the battle with Darth Blockbuster Stargazer, let's get more backstory on the war to upgrade our civlization to the Internet Age. There's lots more stuff to improve then just storytelling technology; like our general knowledge.

Humanity is always asking questions. Some of those today might be, why are the movies so expensive, are candy applies real apples, or, more importantly, what are proven techniques to stop malaria infections. Humanity deal with all these questions by creating a reference tool.

Our first reference tool was the wisdom of our elders. The first technological upgrades were papyrus scrolls and ink (around 2300 BC) and books (about 300 BC), which turned some elders into experts like Hippocrates and Aristotle. When wood-pulp paper (1200) and the printing press (1456) were invented, humanity unleashed mass-produced books. Now experts could share knowledge between themselves and educate the masses. We called the reference books encyclopedias. And as Douglass already showed us, knowledge is the greatest lever of power.

That's why encyclopedias were a massive hit; up until a generation ago, many households proudly included a physical encyclopedia collection in their library. _The Encyclopedia Britannica_ (1878) was the standard. In 1933 it started to be re-published every year to keep people updated to the latest facts. When the Internet Age hit in the 1970s, home computers, digital printers, and telecommunications meant encyclopedias were written and stored digitally. But they remained a set of printed books and CD's controlled by experts.

Then came the world wide web (1991), a new technology that brought the internet, and the Internet Age, directly to Main Street. The web let anyone on Main Street send and receive information, and therefore unlocked many new tools like websites, forums, blogs, and something called "wikis." Wiki software lets anyone write or edit a webpage by pressing "edit now." All changes are saved, so anyone can erase errors or vandalism by pressing "undo now." For years programmers used wikis to write technical manuals collaboratively.

As web boomed in the late '90s, protagonist Jimmy Wales wondered if the web could upgrade encyclopedias. Today, most of us curious about things like the movies or malaria know this story ends with a free online encyclopedia anyone can edit called Wikipedia. It became the poster child for the era of mass-collaboration. But it didn't start out that way.

Wikipedia started as Nupedia (2000), a free online copycat of Encyclopedia Britannica. Nupedia followed the Industrial Age rationale of making gates. It said only "expert" professors were qualified to write articles. Wikipedia (2001) was a side project. Only the programmers, designers, innovators of the Internet Age knew mass-collaboration was the way of the future.

Everyone else didn't realize that with a new technological age, comes a modern philosophy as well. The first sign of a problem with Nupedia was that the professors didn't like to share their knowledge. In its first year, Nupedia had 12 articles. Wikipedia had 40,000.

Here rose Wikipedia's antagonists. Professors loved to belittle the public's articles as rubbish. They even used the Death Star and disallowed students from referencing Wikipedia's materials in their school work. Yet professors refused to improve, or to assign students to improve, Wikipedia. The professors also performed dark majic. Despite good referencing abilities and wide-spread adoption, they still try to convince people to not use Wikipedia. The lever of power was theirs by right.

The second sign of a problem with Nupedia was that it turned out "expert" answers, and "regular" answers are the same. The movies are expensive because of a 1948 "Paramount Decrees" banning studios working with theatres. Candy apples are real apples. And mosquito nets are a simple and effective tool against malaria.

We can all look up these facts because Wikipedia put the levers of power into the hands of player gods! A massive community voluntarily shared their knowledge one "edit now" at a time and fiercely protected their common knowledge with "undo now." Nobody told them, paid them, or made a rule to force it. Because writing or reading a Wikipedia article, is Nature's majical dopamine rush.

That's the story of Wikipedia. Invented by protagonists, upgraded to society's reference tool by player gods. Few believed it was possible because even professors don't understand new tools always unpower the few, to empower the rest. Interestingly, after I finally conceded temporary defeat to my personal Darth Blockbuster, I uploaded a few pages to Wikipedia instead. Not as helpful as my app, but it took just a few weeks of work, and one "edit now" button, to make it real. It felt majical to bypass the rules of the Death Star. It also put a big smile on my face.

## Death Star Goes Ka Boom

Stargazer, think about how important pain is in Nature. Does a penquin in a zoo evolve to Antartica's ever changing environment? Of course not, it's up to the lifeforms on the frontline to adapt, and keep the species alive.

The middle-class flocked to Wikipedia and made it a worldwide force. Then we gave internet streaming to our society. We didn't need marches or protests. We only needed to reached for new tools, hold the levers of power, and thereby evolve humanity. We destroy the Death Star when we do what's best for us. And we're right to be so selfish, because we're the ones feeling frontline pain.

Of course, the antagonists will disagree. But that's why they're Sith Lords. The formal education industry has given American students 1.5 trillion in student debt. Hollywood is given billions in subsidies despite having empty theatres, bad movies, off-shored production, and many self-congratulatory and splend banquets and balls; not to mention a culture of tax-cheats and sexual predators.

The middle-class doesn't have ulterior motives. We are rational beings because we feel the pain of everyday life. We rightfully rejected the dark majic of Blu-ray and HD-DVD, and endured the Death Star attacks when using BitTorrent, and worked to evolve humanity. And if you still doubt Main Street being inherently just, once Jedi Reed Hastings gave the public internet streaming at a fair price with Netflix (2008) the middle-class proved the frontline's superior ethics and morality because we're willing to evolve.

Look at the graph below. You'll see the Industrial Age evolving into the Internet Age because Main Street acted on its best interests. This is the power of an empowered middle-class practicing good politics and grabbing hold of the lever of power. Evolution is always right in Nature, and Techvolution is always right in the game of civilization.

    </script>

Main Street flocked to Netflix because it was a fair deal and a much better product.

During this transformation, I was one of the smucks working at the movie theate and buying DVDs when I could afford them. Like most of Main Street, I got dozens collecting dust somewhere. Darth Blockbuster was telling us all DVDs were better and moral. I wonder, do you think the Sith Lord will buy them all back? I'll talk half-price.

Notice BitTorents aren't dead. While most people don't bother with torrent sites anymore—because Netflix is so much easier and better—civilization holds torrents in reserve. Torrents check and balance the economy in the Internet Age, to be sure Main Street isn't taken advantage of again. Fairness is the motivation for this insightful GIF.

![Battle Scene](/img\diagrams\checks-and-balances-storytelling.jpg)

If you're wondering, streaming companies are returning the studio system to Hollywood, except the home theatre is replacing the movie theatre. The problem is storytelling is getting segmented, making it harder for our society to create new popular stories and updated cultures. The Studio System should never have been outlawed in the first place. But that's a topic for a different book.

I also don't have anything against Industrial Age leaders. Technology never dies. Old indusrial age tools still have a place in the ecosystem. Heck, even Netflix still does hundred of millions in DVD rental revenue. But we're all playing the same game of civilization, so stop protecting your gates and help us win the game before time runs out. Besides, the money isn't in gatekeeping anyway.

Wikipedia and Netflix show how the middle-class can ignore dark majic, defeat Darth Blockbuster, and destroy his Death Star. We ignored bad rules, and instead used the better tool—which soon became the new standard. While we don't have all the levers of power, we have a lot more then we did just a few years ago. But these are small victories. To bring on the era of mass-collaboration in the Internet Age, we need to transform our society's entire rulebook. And that takes a bit more work.

## We've Blown Up One Death Star, Now Here's How We Win the War

So Stargazer, that's how we won a few battles in the fight for the Internet Age. It's a battle that made me, and everyone else who write and read Wikipedia and watch Netflix, happy. Because evolving humanity puts smiles on our faces.

Imagine how happy Main Street will be once we use digital tools and mass-collaboration to solve our agonizing commutes, confusing insurance contracts, over-consumption, and rising global temperatures. That's the war you must jump into with lightsabers a-blazin', dicing up old evil tools, to supercharge humanity into the Internet Age.

Note, our lives cut across thousands to millions of problems. Thus, our villains are not in a massive group like "the rich" or the "the unions" as old philosophies label. Our villains reveal themselves inside thousands of companies, institutions, and organizations of the Industrial Age who fight to keep their version of the Encyclopedia Britannica or DVD alive. They choose to antagonize; there's lots of work ahead in our game of civilization.

This is the entire class of middle-men, consultants, managers, and executives who don't know the skills of their industry like nursing, teaching, and (definitely not) cleaning. Their power comes from managing the gates of an Industrial Age technology, and to keep us competing inside their corporate or bureaucratic heirarchy.

Together, protagonists and extras can overcome these antagonists to bring on the Internet Age. I know this is possible because history has proven it. Our struggle to upgrade civilization was fought generations ago with Darth Blockbuster's master: Darth King.

Darth King ruled atop a huge hierarchy. He lived inside gated palaces, using society's money to host splendid banquets and balls. His absolute control over all the levers of power was hidden inside the Medieval Age's ruling philosophy of the "noble's divine right to rule." The noble Death Star was so powerful, it had could kill extras on demand.

Slowly, as protagonists invented scientific instruments, books, and guns, the Age of Enlightenment was born. With it came values of science, equality, and democracy that turned the people into player gods in the American and French Revolutions. These revolutionaries were inspired by the new philosophy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

![Marie Antoniette](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jhgHG65hfC8/VFT1nla3p8I/AAAAAAAAfwU/8BgnOdFSelo/s1600/Marie-Antoinette-marie-antoinette-27292491-1500-1000.jpg)

## Freeing Cinderella

"Player gods are born free, and everywhere they are tricked into being extras." Rousseau said that in 1762. Actually, he didn't. He said "people are born free and everywhere they are in chains." But the idea is the same. Rousseau was the son of a Swiss watchmaker who grew up to be a famous (or infamous) writer, who still had to copy sheets of music to make his rent. More than 300 years later, he is recognized as being a great philosopher, a political visionary, and a protagonist who helped free the world with his new philosophy.

Rousseau lived when kings and queens, dukes and duchesses ruled civilization. A time when Mozart played inside exquisite palaces during the nobility's many banquets and balls. This was the opulence Cinderella dreamed about about while cleaning a chateau. Sadly, unlike the fairy tale, the people didn't have a Fairy Godmother to make their dreams come true. Instead, the commoners cleaned the nobles' vast libraries, used guns while dying in their wars, and were told to ignore what scientific instruments revealed. As extras in the story of civilization, they were distracted from the power of new tools by dark majic—the people believed their beloved Holy Bible said only Darth King had the right to rule.

Rousseau called bullshit. In truth, Jesus was a carpenter, a commoner just like any other person. So, why can't everyone live up to their potential and become player gods? Rousseau made people understand that books, guns, and scientific instruments should liberate the extras who were only in chains for the happiness of con artists. The self-proclaimed "divine nobility" didn't like hearing that. They declared Rousseau a banquet-pooper, a rule breaker, and chased him out of Switzerland, France, and England. Maybe that's why the genius philosopher rented instead of owned.

It didn't matter. The nobility was in the dying days of their Medieval Age ruling philosophy. Starting in 1776, within Rousseau's lifetime, Darth King started to face the music when the American people started a revolution. One year after Rousseau died, the French had their own revolution in 1789. And, on it went from country to country because Rousseau, and others like him, made extras realize they should become player gods in a country "of the people, for the people, by the people." Cinderella soon forgot about the fancy ball, and instead sung the music of freedom in a choir of equals, that sounded something like this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47E2tfK5QAg?start=5

_Les Miserables is a story of antagonists and protagonists, and of course extras singing about becoming player gods. Notice them holding that lever of power called a musket._

Revolution spread the people's liberty, equality, and fraternity throughout the world. In a few years, the Medieval Age was finally gone. The royal Death Star was destroyed. Church and state were separate. Government had checks and balances. Civilization embraced a new ruling philosophy of Democracy. Main Street put presidents and senators, judges, and sheriffs in power, who ruled at the request of the people. The people were player gods.

Rousseau died never having found a home. After they won their revolutions, the people put him to rest inside the glorious Panthéon. He was heralded as a renowned breaker of chains, destroyer of corrupted rulebooks, and liberator of player gods with his new philosophy that said any guy can be the prince, and any girl can be Cinderella.

The question for us is, how did Rousseau help an entire people embrace a new age, become player gods, and change their ruling philosophy? I'd especially like to know how we do it better because I'd really like to skip horrible wars and revolutions as we venture into the Internet Age.

## Old Philosophy vs. New Philosophy

Techvolution is a philosophy book, but I don't directly reference past philosophies. Like any topic it takes some practice to read. However, let's have a peek and appreciate the strong beliefs of past protagonists and antagonists.

Below are two snippets from two influential philosophers. The passages will help explain how an antagonist can think themselves so right, when history proves them so wrong. I won't comment much on either passage. Just know both of these writers motivated generations of followers to fight to the death.

===

  >SINCE the time that learning began to flourish there has been a common opinion maintained which affirms: "Mankind is naturally endowed and born with freedom, and at liberty to choose what form of government it please, and that the power which any one man has over others was at first bestowed according to the discretion of the people."

  But how this vulgar opinion has of late obtained a great reputation is unknown to me. It is not to be found in the ancient fathers and doctors of the true Church. It contradicts the doctrine and history of the Holy Scriptures, the practice of all ancient monarchies, and the very principles of the law of nature. It is hard to say whether it is more erroneous in divinity or dangerous in policy.

  This desperate assertion whereby kings are made subject to the judgements and deprivations of their subjects follows as a necessary consequence of foolhardy position of the supposed natural equality and freedom of mankind, and liberty to choose what form of government it please.

Patricia, Or the Natural Power of Kings
by Robert Filmer

  >We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. —That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, —That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.

Declaration of Independence
by Thomas Jefferson

===

The belief in nobles divine rights wasn't simple selfishness. A lot of smart people wrote philosophy to justify one person having absolute power. The royal rulebook didn't have to call itself a Death Star; it was based on a respected philosophy.

Today, our Death Star rulebook aren't arbitrary rules. They come from Industrial Age philosophy and the era of mass-production. It's important to remember as we push for the Internet Age. The antagonists feel justified using their Death Star. And they'll keep winning, until we believe in a new philosophy. Remember, Thomas Jefferson and others wrote America's new rulebook, the Declaration of Indepedence and Constitution, after reading Rousseau's new philosophy.

![Treaty of Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Treaty_of_Paris_by_Benjamin_West_1783.jpg)

_The American Revolution ended when USA and United Kingdom signed the Treaty of Paris (1783). The arrogant nobles were so insulted, they refused to sit with the new player gods, and so weren't painted in the official portrait. Player gods get their place in history, antagonists erase themselves. I love it!_

## Society’s Three Stories Tell Us If We're Watching the Story of Civilization, or Playing the Game of Civilization

Entering a new age doesn't require war. Unfortunately, conflict usually tears down the old age and rings in the new. To avoid it while entering the Internet Age, we have to see our society better than Rousseau did. We can do that because we can learn from him.

Rousseau's words echo this sentiment: let society enter into the Age of Enlightenment. Let the people prosper as player gods who use modern tools to improve their work and home lives. Let the nobility return to natural equality. Let anyone lead society—if they can solve problems and thereby earn the public's approval and consent. Rousseau never said there shouldn't be leaders. He said leaders should deserve their spot in charge of the player gods general will.

He didn't phrase it like this, of course, but that's what Rousseau basically said. He understaood every new age needs a new philosophy that unites the people into thinking of the big picture and making a new player god. Rousseau used stories to show us how humanity transitions from being antagonists and extras of an old age, into being protagonists and player gods of a new one. It shouldn't come as a big surprise that the troublemaking philosopher was also a novelist.

Thus, Rousseau understood stories—fictional and real-world ones—best explained the fabrication and inner workings of any society. He understood, too, that there are good and bad stories. And that each stems from a storyteller who has a very particular purpose.

So let's explain the three different stories:

===

**Classic movies**: are good stories about real-life problems. A protagonist—and their supporters—leave their typical day, and build up the courage to think of the big-picture; either they act overcome a newfound problem or no one else will. Antagonists, of course, fight to keep the status quo the same.

In a classic story, the protagonist and antagonist repeatedly think of new ideas and act on them. No one knows who'll win, which makes the heroes all the braver for fighting. Both sides fight to create or control levers of power like magic books or big bombs.

There's no way to know which stories will resonate with audiences. Still, only classic stories can resonate with audiences and become archetypes like _Cinderella_, _Romeo and Juliette_, _The Matrix_, and _Star Wars_. Real-life people find it easy to relate to these stories because they're very human tales of "Rags to Riches" or "Forbidden Love". That's why archetypal stories exist in all cultures and religions.

![Classic story](/img\diagrams\romeo-juliet.jpg)
_Good stories will always be told._

**Art stories**: are not about any specific problem. The main character doesn't challenge themselves or rise to the occasion. They think heroes are born, and thus already have all the answers and the big-picture is doing whatever they want. The main character is selfish and self-important; a con-artist. Not because they do not take on a problem, but because they want to be the protagonist even though they aren't leading the way for others to follow.

The result is stories with no storyline and no antagonist. Instead, art stories showcase the main characters' idiosyncratic behavior. Art stories are surprising to the point of being weird, with a conclusion that doesn't improve reality because the main character didn't even try to.

Without a hero fighting to overcome a problem, art stories need to get weirder and more self-obessesd to maintain interest. To insulate themselves from criticism, art filmmakers usually give themselves awards, grandeur, and titles. They dream of being like their main characters—on stages talking about themselves in a bout of self-gratification. Film festivals like Cannes, Sundance, Toronto mainly show selfish films.

_Ricky Gervais is yelling at a (entertainment) heirarchy so distanced from the frontline, they've completely lost touch with regular people. They virtue signal, as Christian nobility once did, to justify their huge wealth and prestige. There are a lot of parrells between Hollywood elite and late European royals._

**Spectacle movies**:- is about an obvious problem, i.e., Godzilla is here, so run like hell and keep running until the movie is over. Spectacle movies are straightforward because the problem is straightforward; survive or die. However, since the action is so instinctual, there's no time for the protagonist to think of new ideas. The result is logical but unsurprising stories.

Spectacle movies reuse old stories and characters. They usually start off as good stories, but as they ramp up special effects, gore, and raunchiness to try and keep their audiences interested, they lose quality. So spectacle producers look for new customers with hype-filled, dark majic using, mass marketing campaigns. Most franchise movies, sequels, and remakes are spectacle movies.

| Title                             | Budget       | Gross Revenue| % of Budget |
|-----------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| Spider-Man   (2002)               | $139,000,000 | $403,706,375 | 34%         |
| Spider-Man 2 (2004)               | $200,000,000 | $373,585,825 | 54%         |
| Spider-Man 3 (2007)               | $258,000,000 | $336,530,303 | 77%         |
| The Amazing Spide-Man   (2012)    | $230,000,000 | $262,030,663 | 88%         |
| The Amazing Spide-Man 2 (2014)    | $260,000,000 | $202,853,933 | 128%        |

_This is a typical hollywood movie today. A movie is remade and remade, with more effects and celebrities, until the public just doesn't care anymore. These are domestic grosses and don't include inflation or marketing cost. All figures from boxofficemojo.com._

===

These are the three-story categories. In a nutshell, classic stories tackle real-life problems. Art stories are self-obsessed. Spectacle stories are a distraction. This is why art/spectacle stories don't have "spoilers", while we want to "go in fresh" for classic stories.

Society transitions from classic, to art/spectacle inside ages. You can see the transition most easily in your favorite sitcom, such as _The Office, Seinfeld, Friends, HIMYM, The Big Bang Theory_. They start off as classic stories, with characters who deal with relatable problems like not liking their jobs or being tired of dating. We see ourselves in these characters, so we cry and laugh because we know the stories could also happen to us too—we're living the same life on Main Street.

However, in later seasons, to keep their now popular characters alive, the sitcom characters stop evolving. Kramer can never get a job, Raj can't get a girl, Dwight can't get self-aware. Here sitcoms become art and spectacle stories. Art, because the main characters don't overcome problems anymore. And, spectacle, because we the audience keep watching our favorite actors, characters, sets, catch-phrases, instead of wanting a new story. The turning point between classic story and art/spectacle story is often called "jumping the shark".

![GoT horse](/img\diagrams\jumping-shark-got.png)
_Game of Thrones wasn't a sitcom, but it went from great to horrible because the characters became more important then the story. This pictures shows the transition from a majical product, to dark majic one._

Rousseau explained how society has these classic, art, and spectacle stories, and that our communities travel through them as we develop through technological ages. When we start a new age, it's like watching the first years of the sitcom; everyone is solving everyday problems, the main characters have earned their spot; the stories are therefore majical. At the end of the age, the leaders are self-important, and the people are loyal out of habit. In short, Rousseau noticed how one story works to advance and help society, and the other two work to enrich the artists and distract the masses. And that's where we are today. At that's the problem Techvolution has to solve with a click.

You can see this click in the movie called _The Matrix_. It's a story about a dystopian future in which most of humanity is unknowingly trapped inside a simulated 1990's reality called the Matrix. The dream world is created by machines to distract humans while using their bodies as an energy source. It's a wonderfully believable world of dark majic—a spectacle story told to keep the selfish machines in power.

The story's hero is Neo. A regular person who asks "what is the Matrix?". His willingness to question reality, eventually gets him recruited by the few untapped humans rebeling against the machines. Neo rises to the occasion, and learns so much with his open-mind that he overpowers the evil Agent Smith. He finishes the story with a phone call to the antagonist leaders:

  >I know you're out there. I can feel you now. I know you're afraid. You're afraid of us. You're afraid of change. I don't know the future. I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how this is going to begin. I'm going to hang up this phone. And then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world without you. A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries A world where anything is possible. Where we go from there, is a choice I leave to you.

Rousseau would have been proud. But let's see, how we can learn from the French philosopher and Neo, to click our new philosophy.

## Protagonist Kings

Not all kings are con artists. There's a good reason we tell ourselves stories of gallant knights and dreamy princesses. At first, the Medieval Age was led by heroes of a classic tale. These kings and their nobles defeated monsters to create a peaceful country for the people to live in.

In Rousseau's time, noble families ruled every European country. They had absolute power because of their ancestors. After western Rome fell in 476, western Europe entered the Early Medieval Ages (500-1000). Often called the Dark Ages because there were few books, ink, or even literate people to write anything down. In fact, maintaining the existing Roman infrastructure like sanitation, roads, and farms was hard enough. Advanced civilization was mostly gone, the levers of power of organized government or military erased. Anarchy ruled where Rome's Caesars once did.

People like Clovis I, Charles Martel, and Alfred the Great took charge. They were master warriors who used swords, bows, armor, and cavalry to expand their kingdoms, keep away vandals, and fight off invading Vikings and Arabs. Even better, they headed large families who kept a growing peace. Soon they built castles to protect the newly remade cities, markets, and hospitals.

The Early Medieval Ages was a classic story because heroes saw real-life problems. They rose to the occasion, rallied supporters, and fought the evil villains with the most only levers of power left; swords, lances, and castle walls. Fittingly, a hierarchy formed around these levers of power. We call it feudalism. You've probably seen it in shows like Robin Hood, Vikings, or Game of Thrones. Feudalism was a rigid hierarchy of kings, bishops, dukes, sheriffs, knights, priests, tradesman, and peasants. In return for loyalty, the people at the bottom got what was called the "King's Peace." It was a good deal. The growing peace returned civilization. Soon the people had new and better shovels, oxen, thatched houses, buckets, sickles, and other tools to expand their cyborgolgy.

The first kings were basically like mafia bosses. These kings didn't rule inside an official parliament or bureaucracy. Like an Odysseus, Robin Hood, or Neo, they themselves were society's protagonists, making them Protagonist Kings. This was the start of the "noble divine right to rule."

The game of civilization needed civlization to return. Since society had no institutions like dependable judicial systems, standing police force, or governmental departments, the increasing personal rule of the nobility was definitely holy. If they disappeared, so did the re-growing civilization keeping millions of subjects safe. And while it will be hard for us to appreciate, going to church, and believing the holiness of kings, made everyone, even lowly farmers, player gods. Their subservience rebuilt society with every new thatched home, cabage patch, and well. The kings weren't bad guys. They had many battle scars to prove it.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/WarmJubilantIrrawaddydolphin' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

_You'd believe in holy kings too, if barbarians, Vandals, or Vikings were at your doorstep._

Under the rule of Protagonist Kings, Western Civilization rebuilt political institutions, court systems, town councils, sanitation departments. But it was slow going. By the time Western Europe had a fully functioning civilization again at the Renaissance (1400-1600), nobody could remember why the story of divine nobility had started. Who could blame them, the story was already a 1000 years old. Do you remember what happened 1000 years ago?

As Europe went through the Renaissance, the Age of Science, the Age of Enlightenment, the invaders were increasingly gone, fresh water was available, the roads were clean, the markets were busy. The once Protagoinst Kings, were now merely executives of extensive and bureaucratic civilized governments. The only thing that didn't change was the culture of royalty. The leaders had the title of king but were no longer protagonists. They became villains protecting their privilege, who refused to let society grow out of the "nobles divine right to rule", and thus became Antagonist Kings.

## Antagonist Kings

When Western Rome fell, the story of civilization went back to near zero. Picture Syria today and you'll get an idea of the mayhem. Protagonist Kings had a job—grow a new country as fast as possible. Viking raids, Arab invasions, civil wars, famines, the Black Death were all huge setbacks. But over the next 1000 years, Protagonist Kings and the feudal system they headed, rebuilt civilization. Levers of power were once again inside organized governments.

By the time Europe entered the Renaissance, the system had done its job. The nobles were no longer protagonists, but merely average people who happened to be born with "noble blood." For the most part, they only waged war against each other, and usually only for personal glory or "gloire" as they called it. Otherwise, they sat atop a hierarchy who paid no taxes, did not work, and answered to no one. These antagonist nobles used relative peace and prosperity to replace armor with dresses, churches with cathedrals, castles with palaces, and battlefields with banquets and balls.

Loving life, and without opposition, these nobles conned the people, and themselves, with art and spectacle. They lived inside a self-important culture, where increasing weird behavior, childish gossip, and useless titles, was the norm. And they distracted the people with spectacle. Brilliant cathedrals, royal palaces, and meaningless wars against other kingdoms kept the masses occupied. Like franchise movies, all these spectacles got more intense to keep the story interesting.

Visit European castles and extravagant palaces, modest churches, and brilliant cathedrals, and you'll see the transformation civilization had from classic stories to spectacle in Europe's buildings. Compare the clothes of armored clad Charles Martel, and the dress-wearing Louis XIV, and you'll see the transformation from heroic protagonist to self-important Antagonist Kings. They took credit for the accomplishments of civilization, as though they, themselves, were the player god responsible for it all.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/LavishIncomparableBumblebee' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

_Louis XIV (1643-1715) spent an estimated 50% of France's annual Gross National Product to build and maintain his Palace at Versailles, he didn't even pay taxes. He was a self-described god on earth. The people could even buy tickets to tour the palace. It wasn't long before the country "heard the people sing" as the people became player gods by reaching for the levers of power. I love to think what Protagonist Kings would think if they time-travelled to see this opulance. I bet they'd be so disappointed._

During this transformation, frontline problems piled up for the people. Their situation barely changed, and arguably got worse from 1000 to 1778. Their houses were still thatched. They did manual labor all day. They still paid almost all the taxes but were banned from advancing in official society. Feudalism became a caste system controlled by con artists. The leaders fought against distributing the benefits of an advancing civilization to the people doing the work on the frontline. We thus rightfully call Antagonist Kings; Darth King.

When the people were under the Protagonist Kings they tended the fields, make the barrels, and fought the barbarians, they were player gods. They were helping their civilization prosper. With each new era, came more powerful tools, and thus new levers of power. Along the way of progress, society's ruling philosophy of "nobles divine right to rule" flipped from being a classic story to a selfish and spectacle one. The practical reason for noble divinity, fighting off anarchy, was ignored. The nobles lost the plot of their own stories. They turned their people from player gods into extras. It sent Darth King's civilizations into revolutions, and cost him his head.

## Repeat Story

I'm not sure if you know this Stargazer, but the Devil was once an angel. I'm serious. The angel Lucifer was his name. He lived with God up in the clouds with the rest of the heavenly beings. All these angles communicated God's will to His people below; teaching them the virtue, morality, and ethics they'd need to become protagonists and player gods.

But Lucifer rejected God's teachings. He grew vain, greedy, and deceptive. Soon he even challenged God's supremacy. God threw Lucifer down from Heaven to be the Dark Lord of hell.

Free from the restrictions of justice, fairness, and virtue, Lucifer grew his evil powers. Soon he was the Devil, who taught humanity the vanity, greed, hubris, selfishness they'd need to become antagonists and extras. But Lucifer kept his angelic form. The Devil can thus be anyone, at any time. Humanity is a mixture of angels and demons.

![Lucifer](/img\diagrams\lucifer-falls.jpg)

The trick for humanity is to resist our demons and embrace our angels; not make "deals with the Devil" so to speak. That's how we can be player gods who do what's best for ourselves, and help society prosper.

Angels and demons is the Christian tale of good and evil. I'm sure many religions share a similar story. The story of Lucifer echoes throughout literature. Harry Potter's Lord Voldermort, The Lord of the Rings Lord Sauron, and Star War's Lord Vader were all once heroes. Each grew evil because they were unwilling to give up their power. They were corrupted by ambitions of lifelong supremacy. It's probably so prevalent in our religions and literature because it's so common in humanity; power often corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.

Likewise, Darth King wasn't an evil person. The transition from Protagonist to Antagonist Kings took hundreds of years. It's easy now to look back and see it all. But one person, like Louis XIV, didn't have the benefit of hindsight. Louis didn't grow up on a farm, and in his 20's convince people he was their king. From childhood he was treated, told, and expected to be God on Earth. So he went with it.

Darth King actually thought he was an angel. During the Age of Enlightenment, philosophers like Voltaire, Hume, and Rousseau were writing about improving humanity with ideals of freedom and compassion. The nobility read these ideals and liked them. After all, these leaders believed they were protectors of their flock. Absolute monarchs with the power of life and death over their subjects, such as Frederick I, Emperor Joseph II, and Catherine II, called themselves "enlighten monarchs." Their mentality was, "Everything for the people, nothing by the people."

We can see how self-serving this mentality is. Why couldn't the nobles pay taxes? Why couldn't the people have a fair judicial system? Enlightened monarchs preached one thing, and did another. The point is Darth King wasn't evil for being born into nobility. He is evil for holding his people back. He wanted them to be extras watching the story of civilization, and not player gods playing the game of civilization. The nobles thus became fallen heroes. And sadly, this story of fallen kings is repeating itself in our modern times as well. Our antagonists are also fallen heroes.

It's important to note, while Rousseau's followers in so many revolutions may have been political free, they were economically desperate. Hunger, disease, unemployment, illiteracy, were all rampant. Rousseau's time was basically one of "economic anarchy." This is when red/blue philosophies, bent on political liberation from kings, and economic growth to conquer poverty, were born.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/MadeupTameLamb' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

_Here's a tidbit of an Industrial Revolution business magnate George Westinghouse. Among his inventions was the air brake, fridge, and electric generator. Westinghouse's massive company helped conquer economic anarchy._

Society loved the original kings for winning the "King's Peace". Likewise, the initial economic kings were heroes of the era of mass-production who won the "Executive's Prosperity." These heroes said follow me, recognize my property rights, work for my company. The people did. Society got new tools like lightbulbs, stoves, and telephones.

The original leaders of the Industrial Age told a good story, and thus the people were again player gods. Protagonists like Andrew Carnegie, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Louis B. Mayer, are basically the economical versions of original warrior kings like Clovis I, Charles Martel, and Charlemagne.

But when we hit the Internet Age, Protagonist Executives, become antagonist Darth Blockbusters. Another story of a fallen angel.

That should both worry you and make you happy, Stargazer. First the worrying part; Darth Blockbuster defends the Industrial Age because he makes him powerful. He surrounds himself with a story of self-importance and distracts the people with the dark majic of spectacle.

Since, entering the Internet Age, dark majic has skyrocketed in our society. The once humble American Dream to own a home and make a honest living, became a lifestyle of spectacle. Small homes became McMansions with luxury baths and kitches. Cars got way bigger, with more chrome, more horsepower. Televisions increased in size to ludicrious proportions. Food got supersized. Sugar was added to everything we eat. Instead of using digital technology to improve life on Earth, technology was used to make a matrix of dark majic that survived by increasing diabetes, laziness, and greed. All because Darth Oil, Telephone, Suburbs, Sugar needed to distract the people from making a new player god to upgrade, and enjoy the freedom, self-sufficiency, and collaboration of the Internet Age.

The good news is, where not at a "let's burn down society" point yet. We can transition to the Internet Age ourselves before the frontline gets so bad and so ununhappy we start a bloody revolution. We can usher in the era of mass-collaboration ourselves. And that's a strength and a weakness, beause the onus is on us to act.

_This is another clip from The Big Short. This guy is one of our modern day Antagonists. You're not supposed to understand the rationale of CDOs that makes him super wealthy, because there is none. Like the divine rights of nobility, it's just the justification of a self-important hero._

# ACT THREE

## Evolution Yea or Nea

Act three is the nail bitter. The time when a good writer rewards the audience with the final duel, and the answer of who will win: Noble Jedi's or Evil Sith, the Ministry of Magic or the Thugs of Voldemort, Open-source Heroes or Darth Blockbuster Antagonists.

You are the deciding factor Stargazer. Act three in 2020, is a simple question; do you believe in Techvolution? Do you think Right/Left philosophy is outdated? Do you see why the era of mass-production must be replaced by the era of mass-collaboration? Do you want to hold levers of power in your society instead of complaining, protesting, and begging. Do you think our rules, regulations, codes, and laws should be easy to access, use, and understand. When you look at the 1969 way of life—gas cars, fast-food, 9-5 workdays, McMansions—do you see dark majic design to keeps us in the Industrial Age forever?

This final battle has an even simpler question. Do you appreciate your importance to life on Earth? Do you realize you must have the right, and duty, to solve your problems with modern tools. If you don't, we're stuck using adaptions as out of place as Artic polar bears sweating to death in the Savanah. Driving to work in Boston blizzards, forcing non-English speakers to call into a call-centre, depending on doctor writing to record our medical histories. All that's anti-evolution.

Society has no magic button. No divine player who'll evolve for us. You are on the frontline. You are the one in the game that's supposed to do the hard work and update society bit by bit to the new age with the majic of new tools.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/FragrantOldEmeraldtreeskink' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

I think you do understand all this. So, act three comes down to one simple question. Do you want to be a player god? That's a choice you have to make. It's a choice as big as any you're ever going to make. Because if we don't upgrade now, it only means your kids and your grandkids will live even unhappier lives as the burden of transforming society falls on their shoulders.

Here are two stories to help you decide. One to make you realize how powerful Main Street will be in the Internet Age, versus the soul-crushing regret we'll have if we don't running our society on old ideological fumes.

## Option 1 - Player God

The Internet Age has many protagonists. Paul Baran is one of the big ones; a true Jedi. This one guy took it upon himself to prevent a nuclear holocaust. Talk about stepping up. When the Soviets tested a hydrogen bomb in 1955, Baran realized only an updated, robust, and reliable communications network would ease American and Soviet trigger fingers during tense stand offs—so he got to work.

Baran worked all alone for years. By 1960 he came up with his new network's two core ideas; fully distributed data networks, and packet communication. The first eliminated central hubs and hierarchy, the second made sure no information would be lost during transmission. With many pages of technical specifications on hand he went to give his work away. Sadly, the Defense Department surrounded him with red-tape, and AT&T, with a monopoly over America's telephone network, repeatedly said his ideas were impossible. These antagonist shut him down until years later the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) saw the brilliance and built Baran's new network.

By late 1969, as the world was watching Woodstock, Vietnam, and the Moon landing, ARPAnet, the first version of the internet, went online. Reliable communication with no central hubs was born. Few people in the last days of the Industrial Age understood how their world, way of life, and philosophy, had been replaced. The Internet Age was here.

Think of that when you browse the web. The internet was created to survive a nuclear holocaust. Realize how powerful it must be, and therefore realize how powerful you are. The internet is your New World. A place of eternal equality because no one can control you. No professor, executive, president, or king can shut you down. BitTorrents, Netflix, and Wikipedia, all beat Darth Blockbuster, and will keep winning in the war to establish the Internet Age.

Now think of the rest of your technology. Those high-flying drones, sensor filled smartwatches, 20 megapixel cameras, and super-computer gaming systems. These tools are your Internet Age cyborgology. If you had those at Woodstock in 1969, not even those drugged-up hippies would believe your mutant powers. You are a unique lifeform on Earth—for all we know, you're the most advanced lifeform ever.

As Gordon Moore said in 1973 "We are really the revolutionaries in the world today—not the kids with long hair and beards who were wrecking the schools a few years ago." In fact, it's Moore's Law that shows us how much better our cyborgologies keep getting. He predicted that every 12-18 months, the power of computers would double. And he was right. That's why our digital technology is over three million times faster now, then in 1969.

Gordon Moore was part of the "Traitorous Eight" a group of young inventors who founded Silicon Valley. They each had a pivotal hand in creating technology like the integrated circuit, microprocessor, and personal computer. Intel, AMD, Amelco, Eugene Kleiner Perkins, and dozens of other historic companies were started by their hands. More than that, they bucked the rigid corporate heiracrchies of the day, and treated every employee as a member. They started companies based on collaboration.

And they broke the rules to do it all. In the late 50's, the era of mass-production was still in full swing. Everyone was a line worker—a cog in the wheel of machinery. The company told you what to wear, who to socialize with, even what furntiure your office was allowed to have. The company owned it's employees, and wrote itself the rulebook to prove it.

These eight guys said to heck with all that. The game of civilization rewards invention and risk, not conformity and business-as-usual. They left to start their own companies. And so changed the world.

SILICON VALLERY VIDEO
_This is edited down from American Experience: Silicon Valley. Note, this is not neccesarily an endorsement of modern silicon valley._

Traitors. Troublemakers. Shameful act. Equality over heirarchy. Invention over the tried and true: look at your smartphone or laptop, these morals invented your cyborgology. Don't take it for granted. Other business cultures were investing billions and are now totally forgotten. The Traitorous Eight and their followers are heroes, because they went beyond inventing technology. They merged new technology with a new philosophy to create the Internet Age.

Now it's your turn. We first toy around with new technology. Checking news feeds, flying drones, taking endless photos, playing computer games are acts of extras learning the tools of player gods. But to become a player god, we must use our tools as levers of power. Only then will we finish what the Traiterous Eight started, and upgrade our society to the Internet Age.

All it takes tois the click of a new set of ideals of right and wrong, good and bad, in science, art, morals, politics, and economics. Only a new ruling philosophy will unite us to see the big picture; that all our choices matter, because we're all the player god, and only we can win our game of civilization.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/SlimGleefulDuiker' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

_Each game improvement opens up better education, cancer research, crime fighting, electricity generation, product design and manufacturing and so much more. The point is, we've technically evolved so fast, we've far outpaced our politics. We need to click a new philosophy, to start living happier lives in our real-life game of civilization._

We have all this amazing power at our finger tips—and we're letting political pundits tell us if climate change is real? We're letting Darth Blockbuster tell us to... what? Follow his rules that make him king? Look at the video above; in one human lifetime look at how powerful our cyborgology has grown, we can change our own world.

Global warming, human migrations, widespread obesity, antisocial behavior, soaring national and personal debt, high divorce rates, traffic filled roads, hopeless kids shooting up their schools. Our list of problems keeps growing, because the people aren't using the stupendous power of modern technology, to evolve our civilization.

If you chicken-out from playing the game of civilization, then you've chosen to be an extra watching the story of civilization. You've chosen an unhappy life because you think someone else will solve our problems. There's nothing moral about that decision, because a ruling philosophy worth following is one that facilitates evolution; and Right/Left philosophies, and the era of mass-production, no longer do that.

But if want to be an extra. Here's your, and your kids, future.

## Option 2 - Extra

Remember the Thirty Years War, when Main Street was inside the Science Age, but tearing itself apart in the name of Protestant and Catholic kings using the Divine Rights of Nobles from the Medieval Age; adding to that anarchy was King Charles. His nasty, brutish, and short story is what extras think they want sit back and enjoy. So let's watch it.

Charles ruled England as a proud protestant king. His father King James taught him from birth the "Nobles Right to Rule" was a matter of responsibility and faith, not self-interest. In fact it was King James who commissioned the "King James Version" Holy Bible that's still used today. James had it written because he wanted regular people to—among other lessons—understand why kings are their natural leaders.

Remember this was before Rousseau. So, at the time England had many versions of Christianity, and all believed in a kings right to rule. However, England did also have an elected Parliament. But in Charle's eyes it was only supposed to advise the king, which it did, even if most advice was ignored. However, much to Charles' chagrin, Parliament held a lever of power. After some revolts in the Middle Ages, the elected representatives had the power to approve, or reject, new taxes.

Like most kings, Charles and his father spent lavishly; jewelery, palaces, banquets and balls never come cheap. With the Thirty Years War raging, it wasn't long before England went broke and Charles needed more money. Parliament, filling up with idealistic Christians (especially Purtitans, the people who fled to America and started Thanksgiving) wouldn't say yes until they got more political powers. In turn, Charles refused to talk to them. In fact, the king sent parliament home and ruled by himself for over 10 years. The king got his money by using the ancient feudal rulebook. One example, he fined men who didn't come to his royal coronation.

And here is the moment we all should fear. Government was broke, and the question was, who should pay for it. Both sides could, but both sides thought it was the others responsibility. Sadly for Charles, the people were no longer desperate or feafrul. After all, the people were in the middle of the Science Age, and thus enjoying all the benefits of better calenders, record keeping, navigation equipment and so forth. It was precisely because the English people were empowered by new tools, that they could stand up to the king.

But without Rousseau's new philosophy to explain themselves, the people were left asking for change from a king who thought he was a god. Parliament eventually got sick of being ignored. So they raised an army, Charles did the same, and the two sides fought the English Civil War (1642–1646). The Parliamentary Army was local Protestants devoted to democracy—on their way to becoming player gods—who chose their own leaders by merit, and suspected Charles was a closet Catholic. Charles's Royalist Army were mostly nobles who hired foreign mercenaries, and suspected the Parliamentarians had gone mad.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Cx2kkgO5_Y
_Before Rousseau's new philosophy, the people had a hard time justifying being player gods._

After four years of grusome battles and bloodshed, Charles lost. He was held under arrest, while rules for a less powerful "constitutional monarchy" were being made by the Parliamentarians. Charles then escaped, hired a new army, and fought the Second English Civil War (1648–1649). Charles lost again. The Parliamentarians were now enraged.

They forgot about making a constitutional monarchy, and instead charged Charles for crimes against the English people. These newly minted player gods wanted all the levers of power. Charles didn't budge. The ruling philosophy said he was king. The Bible—his father's Bible!, the ultimate rulebook!—said so in plain English. So, Charles refused to speak to the court; a father doesn't answer to his children.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjxu1De8npY

Soon, Darth King Charles stood at the foot of his own chopping block. And what happened next tells us why being an extra today is a really bad idea.

## Charles Speaks His Antagonism- The Proof is in the Words

Public speaking is hard for most everyone; for Charles it was near impossible. Charles had a speech impediment. Often called a stammer or stutter. No one then, or even now, understands what causes it. For a stutterer, talking is like playing guitar with music notes written on the spot by a gremlin. Some words are easy to say, some are ~~difficult~~ hard, and some decide which at the last mili-mili-mili-second.

But a stutter isn't just about pauses, repetitions, or missing words. Stuttering is like having a mini-seizure. Your body flexes. Your neck tenses. You stop breathing. It's horrible. I should know because I suffer from the same affliction as Charles did.

The physical pain isn't even the worst. Getting _that_ look from people is. The "what the fuck is wrong with you?" look.

_"Hello, my ~~name~~ I'm Charles. I wa-want can want to ~~help~~ discuss, the situation with the, ~~Parliament~~ House of Parliament or the-the-the-the people inside, theeee Commons..."_

Actually, the worst part is knowing you'll never talk to anyone about your problem. That's why stuttering forces a person to be quiet, shy, passive, and eager to please. It's very frustrating because one doesn't stutter when alone, swearing, yelling, singing, talking to a dog (Charles had two), or—sometimes—speaking through a "character".

But for some damn reason, in everyday conversation, the gremlin forces erratic speaking, random silence, binge drinking, and watching life pass you by. It's entirely possible Charles' relationship with Parliament was so bad because he simply didn't want to face the gremlin. I mean, should a king have one?

My speech impediment was why I got a job in a car insurance claim department. After a vice-president at an old company secretly told my supervisor I wasn't allowed to talk to customers—for fear of embarrassing the company—I was like shit, I guess I don't have this damn gremlin under control. Of course I was hurt, but I never told anyone I had the impediment, so, despite therapy as a kid, it was obviously still a problem.

So, fuck it. I decided to jump in the ocean and sink or swim in the scary waters of a call-center—a virtual horror show of gremlins were waiting aroung every corner. It was a daily workout of all-day phone calls, angry drivers, customer service expectations, no "outs" like swear words, drinking games, or wonky behavior to hide behind. I stayed with it like that desert fox learning to swim, staying motivated by telling himself, "I'm getting better!."

And it was far worse than I thought possible. The insurance company wanted adjusters to answer ever more phone calls. To incentive us, they'd ring a monotone "bell" because… I don't know.  They never said why (probably because they're stuck in the Industrial Age) we employees learned questioning "the bell" was a bad idea. Management used it as punishment; "answer more phone calls or we'll make the bell faster and louder!"

I'm being serious by the way. We were often more stressed then the person who just had a car crash. Whatever the reason, DING-DING-DING-DING-DING-DING-DING-DING almost all day—which gave people who weren't stutterers tremendous anxiety, breakdowns, and stress leaves.

Super-shock speech therapy! After about a year, I didn't have to massage my jaws at night to release it from all the teeth shattering jaw-clenches I did to divert vocal stuttering. I killed that fucking gremlin! And that's what it took for me to greatly improve my fluency. Like an ocean fox, I walked around a new, happier, person.

Yet, Charles never had this lesson. In fact, he didn't have any lessons. No therapy to learn "turtle talk". No field trips to practice ordering pizza with professional guideance. His gremlin didn't even have a name like "speech impediment". Like everyone back in the day when doctors prescribed blood-sucking leeches as medicine, Charles was all alone trying to make sense of Nature's gremlins of diseases, infections, and speech impediments.

Charles adapted as anyone would. He was famously shy, quiet, and antisocial his whole life. Even when fighting for 16 years defending his ruling philosophy, Charles still probably had to massage his strained jaws every night.

And now, Charles, God's King, was accused of being "a Tyrant, A Traitor, Murderer, and a public enemy to the Commonwealth of England." This was a watershed moment in modern human history. For the first time the people weren't replacing one king for another. They were killing the king, and replacing him with themselves. The people would control all the levers of people and be their own player god!

This was a total shock to Charles. It would be like us watching the laws of physics being broken. It simply makes no sense that a king, isn't the king. There was no rule to reference, no justification to use. The ruling philosophy is the Matrix, and the Matrix is supposed to keep everyone in line. But all of a sudden some people were waking up, and calling the Matrix a lie. A noble lie perhaps, but still a lie.

Charles couldn't make any sense of it. He was devoted to his father, his faith, and his conscience. Being a king was his responsibility, and he thus must defend his country and its holy rulebook. So at his trial Charles only asked by what rule was he being tried? When the judges said "the people" and convicted Charles anyway, the king was astounded. His next chance to talk sense into these misguided mademen would be at his own chopping block.

![Whitehall](/img\diagrams\techvolution-whitehall-charles.jpg)
_This is Whitehall. A palace built by Henry VIII. Charles walked through here to a scaffold and his chopping block. On the ceiling is a painting commissioned by his father which shows James being taken to heaven by angels. Charles was raised his entire life to be a divine king. Could you see outside the divine rights of nobles if you were him?_

## Charles Speaks

Fuck the ringing bell of a claims department, imagine the stress of a stutterer minutes from execution, having to say something to defend his throne, his family's place in history, and his kingdom. I can't explain how anxious he would have been. I know he feared the emotional pain of silence, more than getting his head chopped off.

 ![Charles Speaks](/img\diagrams\techvolution-charles-speaks.jpg)

Now Charles had to stand before these misguided, sinning, want-to-be player gods. He had one last chance to say something. And he said this:

> Truly I desire their (the people's) liberty and freedom as much as anybody whomsoever; but I must tell you their liberty and freedom consist in having of government, those laws by which their life and their goods may be most their own. It is not for having a share in government, Sir, that is nothing pertaining to them. A subject and a ruler are clear different things... therefore I tell you that I am the Martyr of the people. I die a Christian according to the profession of the Church of England, as I found it left me by my father... I have a good Cause and I have a gracious God...I go from a corruptable to an incorruptable crown where no disturbance can be, no disturbance in the world.

Charles spoke his word eloquently; everyone was impressed. He was rarely so clear and passionate. Charles' would have died happy, knowing the angels around his shoulders, killed his gremlin before lifting him up to Heaven. I must say I'm happy for him—it is heavenly to say what's on your mind.

In truth, there were no angles, and no gremlins. Stuttering is an anxiety disorder. So what really happened is amazing. What should have been extremely stressful; the crowds, the soldiers, his lost royalty, and his chopping block; were Charles' freedom. He was 100 percent positive nobles had the divine right to rule. Everyone else had gone mad, and why should anyone be anxious around madmen who've already committed to murdering you? Why be anxious around people who'll never get it? Without any interaction possible, Charles was basically talking to himself, or to ones of his dogs.

We do our best to understand history with songs, books, and images. But we can't time travel. We can't go into Julius Caesar's or Cleopatra's minds and fully understand their motives. But, by luck or good fortune, I can go into Charles' mind at this moment in history. And one of history's most evil Antagoinst Kings, was a completely moral man. He had no hate in his heart. In fact, it was his morality that killed the gremlin. It's the only way he could have spoken a word on that scaffold.

Charles was a victim. A regular person told he was king. When asked to throw that away, it was like being asked to wake up from the Matrix with no experience with frontline pain to prompt the awakening. Could you do any better?

Only a few leaders ever have. Often called "philosopher kings" they have the wisdom and kindness to emphasize with frontline pain. Like good army generals, they use their power to help win the war on the frontline, instead of living in palaces and holding many banquets and balls.

But philosopher kings are very rare. In times of general peace, most everyone in a heirarchy get detached from the game of civilization. The higher you go, the more detached you get because humanity suffers from hubris, and pride indeed comes before the fall. This happened to Charles. He never felt frontline pain, not even in the battles he caused; and that's the point. It's not the job of detached leaders to decide when to upgrade civlization. Why would they want to?

The truth then, now, and forever is that evolution happens on the frontline. Pompeous leaders aren't there. You are.

## Extras Die Off

While Charles was fighting his wars, Europe was fighting the Thirty Years War. A time when Main Street kept fighting and murdering each other for generations; all in the name of a Catholic of Protestant king. Sadly, when the Purtitan Democracy ended in 1658, Charles son Charles II was put on the throne. Without Rousseau's new ruling philosophy, no one had any better ideas. It wasn't long before the new king took his revenge—most everyone who signed his fathers' death warrant was punished; nine were drawn, quartered, and beheaded.

And that's the point to this story. Even though Main Street was inside a new age, very unhappy, and victorious in the two civil wars, without a new philosophy, the antagonists still ended up winning. And remember the English Civil War started over a simple question, "who should pay for the governments massive debt?"

We're having that same fight right now, and nobody is going to volunteer to pay for our 1969 lifestyle that keeps racking up debt to stay alive.

So, if you stay an extra of the Industrial Age, that's your fate. You'll limit your politics to only see Progressivsm or Conservatism. You'll slowly become radicalized, and end up chasing phantoms in the news, rallies, and demonstrations. You'll argue with antagonists at work but get no where. You'll get so frustrated you'll march and scream for change. Eventually, after another financial crisis, debt crisis, migrant crisis, disputed election, constituional amendment; some crisis or another, the West will reach the end of kicking the can down the road, and live through a new version of the Thirty Years War or English Civil War. That's not supposed to sound alarmist. It's a diagnosis using our history.

And regardless of "wanting to stay out of it" extras will be forced to stop watching their civilization, and join in, as our society tears itself apart.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEczkhfLwqM
_"A warning of the dangers of entrusting power to those who feel summoned by God to war, or feel that their sense of justice and order is the only one valid." How much longer do you think before Red/Left politics completely breaks down? Look at their devoted followers raging at each other, do you want to let them decide your fate?_

And in the end, Left and Right will quite literally kill each other off. Because we're in the Internet Age, and every new age, eventually gets a new ruling philosophy. We can skip all the bullshit of Left/Right hatred, and upgrade right now, because we can learn from our ancestors on Main Street who used Rousseau to demand their happiness. Which they got when they clicked a new philosophy and reached for the levers of power as player gods.

## Look Up

Look up. Whereever you are, look up. Do you see the "mythical player god"? No you don't, and you never will. You are that player; you're choices determine what happens in the game. If you eat a salad over a cheesesteak, that means health statistics get better. If you walk to the store instead of drive, you improve road traffic. If you read instead of binge watch, society gets more educated.

You are the lifeform playing the game of civilization. And doing the typical thing of suburban house, soccer practice, 9-5 commute, 401k, saving up for college, television every night, is losing us the game. Your soul already feels it—it's why we're so unhappy because we know we aren't living up to the potential of the Internet Age. To win again, everyone has to adapt in the exact same way a polar bear would have to adapt in the Amazon. Take it one step at a time.

That's what Techvolution is. The self-awareness that we are all the mythical player god. It's therefore our right, and duty, to do whatever we must to win the game. You don't have to change the entire world. You only have to do what you can to improve your slice of it. And the compass that shows you the way, is your own happiness. Not the pretend happiness that has to brag to about getting more stuff. The happiness inside your soul that smiles when it majically contributes to evolving life on Earth. Evolution is not race, but a never ending game.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/CandidFeistyBuckeyebutterfly' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

The question is, did Techvolution click?

I know one thing. Thanks to to Internet Age protagonists, you can't go back to snail mail, telephones, or Blockbuster. You're a modern day cyborg committed to using the tools of the Internet Age. These super powerful tools are everywhere. Levers of power waiting for you to grab.

It's up to you to take hold. Darth Blockbuster will never, ever, ever, "see the light" and play the game for you. That's why I'm not writing to "The Executive." I'm writing to you Stargazer. You're the player god!

![Illustration](/img\sketches\playergod-stargazer.jpg)

The fate of civilization is fully on your shoulders. Your job is to do what's best for yourself, and help society prosper. Looking up for guidance you see two options. Open-source Jedi who've never stopped struggling, innovating, and filling the world we majic. And the self-importance, short-sightedness of Darth Blockbuster—the fallen hero of the Industrial Age who uses the trickery of dark majic and a corrupted rulebook to keep himself in power.

The fate of civilization is then, rather simple. Who is your hero Stargazer? Will you be an extra of the Industrial Age, or a player god of the Internet Age? We all await your choice. The conclusion of Techvolution A New Philosophy is thus a simple discussion inside your head. Which might look something like this...

## The End

I wanted to write beautiful Platonic dialogues for you here. I'd love to have Antagonists and Protagonists debating with Stargazer, who has an internal discussion between the benefits and drawbacks of being an extra or player god, and the joys of majic versus dark majic.

I'd also love to write "Black Mirror" stories about cyborgologists, techvolutionaries, majicians (whatever you call them), rejecting the easy money of Industrial Age society, and fighting to bring people out of the Matrix and into the Internet Age.

Imagine these guys as overclocked Linus Tech Tips. In fact, today's "geeks" are really majicians in waiting. Like revolutionaries of old, these are the people who know how powerful modern computers are. Darth Blockbuster's excuses mean nothing to them. Soon, they'll bring Main Street into the era of mass-collaboration; roofers will learn to use drones, cleaners IR cameras, craftsman 3D printers. Because of yesterday's geeks, the middle-class will like their jobs, raise their families, and give their kids a brighter future on a newly empowered Main Street.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/WhimsicalLeadingFirebelliedtoad' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p> <a href="https://gfycat.com/whimsicalleadingfirebelliedtoad">via Gfycat</a></p>

_An idealized view of mass-collaboration. Although we'll lose the suburban lifestyle once there's no antagonists or extras, and just protagonists and player gods._

I want to write all this stuff, but I can't keep thinking for you. Nor do I want to keep holding your hand. This book has been informative enough. At the start I asked "are you happy?" Now you have to ask yourself "Am I going to do something about it?"

Our unhappiness is a fire alarm. Look around, and see old drafty windows, gas engine cars, call-centres, cable news, mass-producted toys, toilet paper commercials, eight different bosses, another corporate meeting, huge forest fires, idiotic rush hour traffic, endless suburban houses, boiling temperatures, hungry polar bears, leaky faucets, consultant huddles, hopeless kids... Do you see the Industrial Age? Do you want to improve your part of the world with new Internet Age levers of power?

Or, do you want to return to the comfort and safety of being a Industrial Age extra, bragging about gas cars, fake job titles, and McMansions, while following the antagonists rules, and chasing the phantoms of Left/Right politics. Did Techvolution click? The fate of your life, your kids, and of your society, rests on the simple question—will you step up and become a player god in the game of civlization?

If you do, we win. If you don't, we lose.

# EPILOGUE

## Welcome

Hello Stargazer! I'm glad you came aboard. If it wasn't for you, the future would exist only in science fiction. Now because of you, we can start Techvolution. While I dearly hope Left/Right politics gets better, I don't think we should wait and see—it's much safer to make the future happen now.

There's lots of work ahead. But we've done it many times before, the Minutemen, Abolitionist, Civil Rights, Environmental, movements have all changed the world. While I, unfortunately, can't tell you what your journey will be like. You can be your own celebrity. I'm sure you'll soon love to tag #installsolarpanels, #forgetrushhour, #newsmallbusiness.

And if you like, you can follow my trek to make our society better. I'll be your guide.

## My Frontline Problem

Watch this clip from Netflix's _Black Mirror_. It's a story of a crazed man who wants to talk with the CEO of an Instagram-like app called Smithereen. He holds a company intern hostage awaiting the CEO’s call. Police surround him, corporate lackies try to deflect him, bullets are fired at him, but he still wants his phone call. The only thing people know is he was hit by a drunk driver years before.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gF1oGQ2hAA&feature=youtu.be&t=57

New technology is either our salvation. Or our distraction. This is frontline pain. It's not caused, or solved, by Progressives, or Conservatives. It's neither someone else problem, or bad luck. This is the pain of regular life on Main Street. Pain is what evolution uses to force lifeforms to adapt, and if we refuse, life finds someone else to carry it's banner.

These are the poor souls car insurance adjusters speak to. While most aren't so devastated; far too many are (in fact many adjusters don't use social media because of threats from callers, sadly a kidnapping isn't too outlandish. Some callers send thank-you presents though so there's good and bad). Deadly crashes, hijackings, abductions, drive-by shootings, drunk driving, car fires, running red lights, and yes, distracted driving—every human tragedy eventually calls an insurance adjuster. And all the while DING-DING-DING-DING-DING-DING.

I wept while watching Smithereens; full out tears. I knew what the plot twist was—that distracted driving killed a loved one—because I'd spoken with this person too many times. This was the motivation for me to make my app. I wanted to help solve horrible, useless, and preventable car crashes with something (I now call) the Life Star.

Here's why I failed; and here's why I'll succeed.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(57.50% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/GrandUnknownHagfish' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p> <a href="https://gfycat.com/grandunknownhagfish">via Gfycat</a></p>
_This is the what digital technology is good for. Only player gods will reach for it._

## My App

My app was very simple. Using modern web development, it took just a few months of work. Take some free code from GitHub, an inexpensive cloud computing account, and the design skills of a novice. It was so simple, it might not even get me a job in "tech."

Here’s how it worked. Today's insurance industry is entirely based in the Industrial Age. So after an accident, drivers are expected to exchange information. Because they're (understandably) frazzled they often don’t. Adjusters have to search for each other—literally calling around or hoping someone calls you. Delays pile up like crazy; causing most of the maddening DING-DING-DING-DING-DING-DING-DING-DING.

Like Uber uses online maps, my app let adjusters post an accident on a google map. Since every accident shares GPS coordinates, all adjusters, regardless of what drivers do, can find and email each other. It’s minimal cost was paid for by rental car companies and repair shops who loved the ability to communicate with adjusters online instead of waiting on hold.

That's how simple it is to foster mass-collaboration and save hundreds of millions of dollars and millions of hours of productivity. That's how much the Internet Age is already here, but the Matrix of the Industrial Age dark majic keeps it from people's eyes. To wake workers up, all I had to do was show my app's majic; they instantly smiled.

The best part was something much better. With digital collaboration we can start getting great information on our economy. For example, with my small little app, for the first time, we’d have a database of the exact location and causes of car crashes. Thereafter we could cross reference with weather, traffic, demographics, and many other databases. We’d finally learn why car crashes happen, and start to fight back.

A database of crash locations and causes doesn’t exist today. Government regulators don't care about it. Insurance company managers don't care about it. Extras tell themselves "they" are solving their problems. So, when tires are faulty, intersections jam up too much, pot holes get too big, or anything else repeatedly causes crashes, we don’t even know.

My little app was a happy upgrade in the game of civilization; but not good enough. Or more likely, too good. My biggest problem was I messed with a lever of power. Now because of Techvolution, I can depend on player gods to help me fight back.

![New Tool Creation](/img\diagrams\techvolution-civilization-is-here.jpg)
_Look familiar? Uber, Airbnb, and my ap, all use GPS maps. Kind of looks like the game of Civilization doesn't it? Didn't I tell you computers games teach us how we'll live in the Internet Age. A sneak peek at the Life Star._

## Attacking a Lever of Power

Adjusters hold the insurance checkbook in their hand. They decide how much to payout on every claim. Making adjusters use telephones isn't an accident. It's a huge lever of power to say "call me when I'm available". By easing congestion, and taking away the DINGS, I was in effect taking away the insurance company's ability to create friction for anyone withdrawing money. And, lessening crashes wasn't much of a selling point either.

This was never officially said to me. Remember being far from the frontline makes people not realize the consequences of their actions. In fact, most insurance decision-makers today have never even spoken with a customer; nevermind processed a claim. They'd watch Smithereens with no tearful recognition. Simply put, with no pain felt, there was no problem to solve.

Thus, now I know how to fix my failure. The key to success, for me and you Stargazer, is making a modern lever of power, then making frontline pain common knowledge so we turn extras into player gods who take control of their lives.

<a class="twitter-timeline" data-width="600" data-height="500" data-theme="light" href="https://twitter.com/OPP_GTATraffic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">Tweets by OPP_GTATraffic</a> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
_This is a Twitter feed for the Ontario Police. It tells everyone about crashes in real-tme. People on this list—right now—are living through Smithereens in some way. That pain used to only by the unlucky few, but by making it common knowledge, we can all feel the pain and us mass-collaboration to solve it using the life saving rules of the Life Star._

## The Life Star

At it's heart, Smithereens is a story about an extra. The tortured man assumes the company Smithereen will care about his problem. Extras assume "they" have the people's best interest at heart. "They" in government bureaucracy. "They" in corporations. "They" someone else. The truth is, "they" only have your interest at heart if you're holding levers of power. Because only then does "they" the powerful, becomes "we" the player god.

And that's the subject for the next book. For all the antagonists blustering and excuses, once a regular person becomes a player god, the game is won. The only reason Smithereens happens, the only reason those damn DINGs are still ringing, is Main Street accepts what the antagonists give.

Consider this, for every dollar Main Street puts into car insurance, we only get back 50 cents in claims; the rest goes to taxes, marketing, and administration fees. Insurance is basically a bank account, so we're losing half our savings every year and still waiting on hold! The middle-class has to do far better if we're going to live happy lives again.

This book made you a player god in mind, the next will make you a player god in reality. You'll finally hold many levers of power in your hand, first and foremost for car crashes. No middleman. No phantom chasing. No dark majic. No Death Star. No Darth Call Centre. Just you in control of your destiny—exactly like a person playing _Civilization, Anno 1800, or Cities: Skylines_ who always has all the levers of power they need to win the game.

That's what the Life Star is—the technological re-creation of Evolution; a rulebook to enforce Techvolution. It lets everyone play, understand, and master the game of civilization with fair, accountable, and understandable rules that give everyone a chance to win. A rulebook that makes everybody happy. Philosophers call it the rational state earned through years of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. I also call it the state of nature because all lifeforms happily live inside a place where Darth Blockbuster isn't allowed to play. You'll soon hold my new app in your hand, and read all about you power to win the game of civilization in Techvolution: Building the Life Star.

# THE APPENDICES

## Other Stuff

Hello. Thanks for sticking around. The appendices is some stuff I couldn't fit into the narrative of the book, but I thought might be cool to know. Just aheads up, It'll be more abstract then usual.

## Bears Everywhere, Polar Bears Only In Some Places

I never wanted to write this book. Most of this book is based on combinining the lessons of evolutionary biology and political philosophy. I think they're the same field of study, so similar they suggest a supreme physical life field of some kind. I used my take on political societies earned by using Aristotle's Poetics to better understand Hegelian Dialectics. It's work I did years ago. There's a lot to it—a genuine work of science forthcoming in _How to See the Matrix_—but it's original thinking will need the objective data from the Life Star to prove.

Most people are extremely bad at understanding their political opinions. While it's kinda of easy to get people to question their ideas using for example the Socratic Method, they'll revert once released back into the community. Psychology, upbringing, temperment, education, life experience, and all that intermix to form our politics. The Life Star will help us decode this jumble. But there's one thing that is far stronger than our opinions that determines our actions in political community.

The game of civilization; another way of saying human evolution. Human life does what all lifeforms do and gathers resources, grows, and diversifies. And it's this last point that has proven to hard for me to explain.

There's no way around the game of civilization. Like evolution to lifeforms, we all are inside it. It's paint by numbers. Tracks on the road. We all live and die under it's demands. Playing a Civilization computer game is really the best way to understand it. In the game, every player starts off small, then gathers resources, invests them smartly, and grows. Playing the game teaches the importance of geography, technological upgrades, adopting modern philosophies, defeating everyone who opposes you, investing in research and development, avoiding building palaces to host jewellery laden banquets and balls.

But no computer game forces the player into diversification or "adaptive radiation." In every game a player tries to take over the world with his one civilization. Never does the player have to segment himself into different civilizations. But, in natura this life-cycle of seed, growth, then adaption and diversificationns happens to all lifeforms and thus all civilizations. Few people realize how human cyborgology is the same as biology.

Polar Bears are nearly identitical to Brown Bears. But they're polar for a good reason. If they didn't adapt to the cold, water, and food supply, they've never live in the Artic. Thus, life diversified them. Adaptation is why we can't send the suffering polar bears to the Amazon, or even Antartica. They are not adapted to the climate in one area, and the ecosystem in the other. Imagine penguins with a few antartic polar bears walking around. Happy feet indeed.

The point is this. We evolve just like any other lifeform. But we evolve with tools, and we evolve in ages. So we start off small, grow, and diversity in waves. Each new age, is like new lifeforms, new cyborgs, spreading across the world for the first time. Look at the European Powers below, who colonized the world a few generations ago during the Age of Discovery.

<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:44%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/eSItBDecz3oJy" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/maps-cartography-territories-eSItBDecz3oJy">via GIPHY</a></p>
_This same thing is happening to the world-wide economy. We just don't have the philosophy to understand why, so we fight back against forces of Nature and adaptation._

The European Powers spread advanced civilization far and wide. Brutally in some cases—has anyone invented a way to spread new civilization or new life easily? But that's the point. Evolution doesn't care about individuals. Evolution is the rulebook by which life seeks out new and better ways to prosper.

So life spreads far and wide with no consideration for the lifeforms already there. But once the victors are declared, life no longer needs to spread, but now diversify into many different ecosystems. Ecosystems is how life stays fit, ready to adapt to an dangerous world. Thus, when the Age of Discoverty ended, it started the Age of Revolutions. Revolutions was life making human ecosystems as the GIF shows above.

Life thus has a two step process. One age of growth, the other of diversification. And this explains sooooo much of our politics today. The Industrial Age was one of world-wide growth. The second step, Internet Age, is one of diversification. And we're in this diversification phase right now. But nobody knows it, because we still use the Right/Left, era of mass-production philosophy of the Industrial Age.

So Trump and Brexit were inevitable. Our society wants to diversity after the Industrial Age. This is part of the game of civilization we all play, but few see the entireity of. That's why the established powers of the Industrial Age were so suprised, and have so much hatred, for nativist politics in the West. Although nativist politics isn't the future. Like the English Civil War, they're using old philosophies to try and make fundamental change. Only Techvolution, conscious adaptation using modern tools, is the new philosophy for our new Internet Age.

I plan to write a textbook on Techvolution (How to See the Matrix), I'll love to now delve more into the game of civilization for you., and teach you how to decode the trends of history: what a civil war is, how to predict a revolution, and so forth. The game defines our lives in so many ways, because it determines the roles we play in our lives. The accident of birth to parents, geography, or time-period makes us antagonists, protagonists, extras and player gods. Few people understand their role, and a insight might help you choose Techvolution. But that'll come later. Hopefully.

## The End of One Game, and the Beginning of a New One

This section is my personal opinion, so take it for what it's worth to you.

The Western World is a made up term. Don't get me wrong, it's a good way to describe the shared culture of France, Britain, Holland, America, Austrialia and the other members of the political unit we call "The West". But if you look down at the globe, these landmasses wouldn't look united. The West is a human creation. There was no "Western Europe" in Roman times. The entire Mediterranean Sea and surrounding land was unified under the Roman Empire.

It wasn't until western Rome fell in 476, and North Africa was conquered in the 700s, that what we call Western Europe became isolated, and hence got its own identity. It was these once barbarian germanic tribes, newly converted to Christianity and loyal to the idea of Rome, who laid the seeds for Western Civilization. The first kings of Western Europe survived the Dark Ages. They slowly returned civilization in the Medieval Ages. By the time the Renaissance Age came, Western Europe was doing quite well. But it was in the Science Age and the Industrial Age that the West saw their power grow world wide.

If the world had ended in 1900, The West would have won the game of civilization. Western Europe didn't have a head start. They didn't have any sort of advantage. If it's geography, resources, genes, or whatever were the reason for the West's rise to power, why did Rome fall. Why did Western Europe suffer so greatly in the Dark Ages if they had advantages available to no one else?

Western Europe conqured the world, because it used modern technology better than any other civilization. That's because philosophy is a gift. It lets humanity invent and use new and better tools. Ancient Greece got it first, then it went to Rome, then to Middle East in the Islamic Golden Age, back to Italy in the Renaissance, where it spread to Western Civilization during the Science and Industrial Age, and thereafter to the world via European colonialization.

Updating, or "clicking", a new philosophy is pivotal when playing civilization games for a good reason. Our real-life societies have to keep upgrading. Because the game of civilization never ends. Famines, wars, prosperity, climate change; clicking new philosophies is the only way to keeping inventing new tools, harvesting more resources, and surviving the game. There are antagonists inside every society. That's no excuse to stop playing. The rest of society either defeats them, or their civilization is replaced by another player and the idle extras still lose; their biological DNA (what genes we pass on) and cyborlogical DNA (what tools we pass on) is out of the gene pool either way.

Playing Civilzation, Anno 1800, or any other game is a better education than the best schooling today. These games mimick real-life, and thus integrate so many lessons. They force players to think of the big-picture that's so hard to appreciate in real-life. It's an invaluable perspective, especially to our society which is so obessed with itself, inside our spectacle, and art stories.

Our culture is very entrenched in the Industrial Age. So many people live to take credit for titles, instead of accomplisments. Professors, managers, executives, union leaders, all cherish the title of Industrial Age heirarchies. These well-intentioned people don't want to return back to equality that happens at the start of every new age. They refuse to upgrade our philosophy. Or they want someone else to do the hard work. The result is, the West is in the process of losing the game.

We are in an entirely new age. The Internet Age is just as historical and powerful as the Science Age. And nobody has earned victory over it yet. Africa, South America, East Asia, Middle East, India, Eastern Europe, any civilization in the world is no better off then the West. Actually, I'd say, the West is far behind in the race to win the era of mass-collaboration.

In all my schooling, reading, discussing, working, in all my life, the ancestors of the barbarian kings, the ones whose grand parents worked 365 days a year in horrible English factories, who suffered famines in Ireland, draughts in France, and wars throughout Europe, the ones who worked the labs in New York, who worked the mines of Pennsylvania, the lines of Michigan, who solved millions of different problems during the Science and Industrial Ages as player gods; their grandkids today simple don't want to feel frontline pain. And without pain, they fell no reason to change update to the Internet Age. As one sharp observer noted to me "it's like they've folded their cards."

It's why so many of todays Western protagonists and player gods are foreigners. Also why so many tortured souls are born with irrationality (conspiracy theories and mental illness) in western society. Society is using their curse, to be irrational against the corrupt rulebook, and start (involuntarily) discovering the just rulebook of the next age. Irrational people are the most likely to see through the Matrix and start the rebellion. Their curse is to live the rebellion of the mind all the time. The laziness of their society, dooms them to miser. It's like these poor minds been clicked to find a new path for the rest of people to follow. That's the rationality of irrationality. The longer we hold off upgrading, the most cursed minds our society is forced to make.

Fighting to delay the upgrade, is also why so many antagonists import extras (illegal immigration, migrant crisis, legal immigration) into the West, because they know desperate people are inherent extras, and only a society of extras, keeps antagonists of the Internet Age in power in the 21st Century. With so many non-members, the West will likely not be able to form a new Internet Age player god. Said differently, the West can't form a community again, because most everyone inside either thinks they individually are self-sufficient and can spend their days watching sports on TV, walking their dog, and having a few casual friends. Or people in the West have a hyphenated identity of Blank-American. A player god is a community, the era of mass-collaboration needs a community of members, and the West has little of community left.

_This the Antagonist Executive at work. No jokes, too many know how real this is. Darth Blockbuster's delusion of being the leader, despite personal incompetence, lasts until player gods rise up. I feel like I'm watching Charles trying to make battle plans. I can't help but see "the decline and fall" in this sketch._

Modern technology is so powerful, it overcomes any natural drawback like language, geography, or history some places in the world have. That means the winner of the Internet Age is up for grabs. I don't know who will win. I do suspect though, the people of the West are dead-set on celebrating away their ancestors glory, quite literally living off their inheritance, and happily going down with the ship that was Western Civilization. With so much to gain from complacency, evolution is an unreasonable risk; especially when there's often no pain felt. I can't help but see "the decline and fall". Not of a state or government, but the civilization itself.

One thing I do know, that whichever society throws away the memories, excuses, and philosphies of the past, and embraces Techvolution and the era of mass-collaboration, will be the winner of the Internet Age. It's their player god who will happily reign supreme for many years in the never ending game of civilization. I smile, thinking of all those bakers, tailors, designers, roofers, engineers, cleaners, repairmen, and maybe even a few majicians, smiling on a new and empowered Main Street.

Hopefully they'll colonize the West, and so, bring on the Internet Age to the world. At least with this book, those people in what remains of the West, can read what their grandparents could have done as they regret the choices of player gods who lost because they refused to play the game.

## Stuff I Couldn't Fit In

I tried to make Techvolution very readable. Almost all the topics and subjects are metaphors for the lessons Europe learned going from the Dark Ages, through the Medieval Ages, to the Science Age, Enlightenment Age, and finally the Industrial Age. So there was a lot of stuff to fit it. If you're a history or philosophy nerd, I hope you realize why I synthesized things the way I did. The benefit was, by keeping things simple, I was forced to better understand the content.

Without changing our path (which I mentioned above, I can only hope is coming) The West really is headed towards societal failure, a new version of the Thirty Years War. That's not supposed to sound alarmist. It's a diagnosis using our history. Every new age needs a new philosophy that unites the people into thinking of the big picture and making a new player god. Unless we create a player god in an era of mass-collaboration soon, we wont stay ahead of our problems and people will fight for a better life using the philosophy of the past; just like our ancestors fought against Catholicism and Protestantism when the real enemy was selfish, effeminate nobility.

If I could travel back to 1618 to those very unhappy Europeans on Main Street, I'd say the same thing to them I told you. But they wouldn't believe it because I'd be talking about the future. With you it's been the past. There's a better chance it'll all click.

By clicking of course I mean upgrading our philosophy. While there are always lots of lessons in all philosophy books, in the game of civilization certain cards or philosophical upgrades are much more important than others. For reference, here's some of the lessons our ancestors taught us in blood, sweat, and tears, and I used in this book.

===

**Modernity**: Inspired by the Renaissance, and started during the Age of Enlightenment. Modernity makes the point when we got modern technology and made modern philosophies. The printing-press, telescope, microscope, and so forth, let humanity develop better philosophies to explain Nature. If I were to have written this book another way, I'd have said modernity is hitting the social sciences, as it did years ago to the physical sciences. Postmodernism and its friends in Left and Right, are phantom chasing geocentrics trying to validate their bygone belief system against the rising tide of evidence a new philosophy is needed.

The point it, we can take all the lessons of the first wave of modernity, and apply it to the second, which is what I did here by referencing the works from Machiavelli to Hegel, but excluded anyone after, because none of them integrated the technological possibilities of the Internet Age. They are like the geocentrics who tried to keep everyone believing the Earth stood still, even after a new and better philosophy was being discovered.

That's why science fiction writers are much better to study then any post modern (supposed) thinker.

**Phantom Communists and Fascists**: The Renaissance, and Scienge Age, was kicked started by Nicolo Machiavelli, who was among the first to implore humanity study cause and effect, to improve our lives on Earth. He asked his contempories to ignore the  "Imagined Principalities" of religious people, who had the people ignoring their real-life pain, because of a belief they'll be rewarded in the afterlife. Any philosophy based on the way things ought to be, had people complain about the real-world, instead of accepting the facts of life, and trying to improve them. Machiavelli called heaven "Imagined Principalities".

Christian belief about an afterlife helped Medieval peasants stay loyal as their community was slowly rebuilding civlization. But by the Renaissance and afterward, only thikning of the afterlife was a needless distraction. Civilization had upgraded, and needed Main Street to start being selfish and take the lead as scientists, doctors, writers and so forth.

I'm making the same point here. That Main Street is distracted from modern philosophy, by holdovers. Just as geocentrics stayed alive by telling the population about "heretic Galileo!", so does our old philosophies stay alive by cries of "they're evil". Instead of "Imagined Principalities" we have "Phantom Communists and Fascists".

**Frontline**: is Machiavelli's "effectual truth." Machiavelli came from a relatively poor family. But he was well educated, and his father gave him many books from the recent printing press. Machiavelli was the first philosoper to get to read lots of different philosophy and history books, and he noticed trends. He told superstitious Europeans, they didn't need to put their faith in God, because we can keep looking for trends, master them, and start to overcome problems like hunger, disease, and all that.

Soon later Galileo, Francis Bacon, and lots of other people, read this insight, and invented the Scientific Method, which systemized looking for "effectual truth" by simply testing Nature with instruments, and discovering the truth, not inventing it with beliefs or reason. Hence, true truth is the "point of contact" between a tool and it's use. That's true in a scientific experiment that upgraded the physical sciences. And now, it's true in the second wave of modernity that will upgraded the social sciences. And for that, the frontline of everyday life is where we'll find the true answers; not the rules of the social or noble heirarchy.

**Player god**: Is my way of saying political community, what Plato called "politia". My version comes from Thomas Hobbes. He lived during the English Civil War, when people were again sick of the king but didn't yet have a different ruling philosophy to replace him with. Hobbes invented human equality by saying in Nature (he called it the State of Nature), all lifeforms live freely, thus why shouldn't humans. Hobbes said people should still be loyal to a king, but not because the king is divine, but because one person having absolute power is in everyone's best interest to have a stable and firm government. When that goes away—as Hobbes was personally seeing—people turn horrible.

And this is what I mean by each philosophy contributed partial upgrades. Because while we don't have kings anymore, yet we use much of Hobbes reasoning. John Locke came after Hobbes and agreed with his State of Nature, but said the people didn't need to put all their trust into a person as leader, but instead put their trust in the institution as leader. Meaning, the people should follow a president, not a king. Moreever, government should be split into different responsibilities for executive, legislature, and judicial. This way, each will "check and balance" each other, and thus government will still function, but won't be easily corrupted and become worse than the anarchy it's supposed to solve.

Rousseau later came and said a true democracy is made up of the people. Unlike Hobbes/Locke, who said humanity was not born from a chaotic Nature, but a kind one. In fact, it's society that corrupts people into being evil. Thus, it's up the way society is structured to ensure the best of humanity is brought up, instead of repressed. Rousseau made the connection that individuals make up their society, so if each individual reformed themselves, they'd all make a better society.

While Rousseau's visions lead to a lot of social engineering disasters. Modern technology and especially open-source, is so liberating, and so individually empowering, we can make a good and just player god. We can have the best of both worlds, a stable government and society, that doesn't need to, and in fact can't, oppress the people.

**The Game of Civilization**: Hegel's March of Reason. G. W. F. Hegel (1770– 1831) distinguished mere fact from history, or from what he called World History. He was the master of the philosophy of history. Rather than let fact silence reason, he tried to infuse reason into fact; he saw the “march of Reason” in the facts of World History. World History, he tried to show, developed in “dialectical” stages until the Rational State was perfected—which by good chance (so Mansfield says) turned out to be the very state of Prussia in which Hegel was living. Here was the end (in the sense of the completion) of history: a state without parties in which there is nothing fundamental left to dispute. Yet as soon as the rational state was announced, everybody—Marx and Nietzsche in the forefront—scrambled to dispute it. Even as Hegel was writing, Tocqueville reproved the sort of democratic history that subjects human events to impersonal forces over which men have no control and that levels mankind to a herd of impotent individuals.

I never read Marx or Nietzche. There was something about inspiring evil that had me stay away. Instead I read science fiction writers, they had the imagination to see the future based on our tools, not on the history of philosophy.

**The Game of Civilization vs. The Story of Civilization**: Or being a player god vs. being an extra. This is Machiavelli's "wised up". Meaning when a civilization is self-aware it takes its survival seriously and not for granted, and thus plays the game, instead of passively watching the events as if it can't determine it's own outcome.

**Your Happiness**: The best gauge on how healthy the player god is.

**Heirarchy**:: is from the friction of distance. The farther people are from the pain, the more likely they're disregard it. So for all her faults, Sofia Auld did teach an enslaved person to read. That's only because she spent time with him everyday. Natural humanity comes out with empathy. And empathy needs to be seen, heard, and felt to exist. That sad truth was, the further away a slave owner was, the more terrible their treatments of slaves. I hate talking like this, and so did Douglass, but a house slave was treated better than a farm slave, who was better off than a plantation slave, who was better off than a colonial slave whose (asshole) "owners" were in a different country. Proximity brings more humanity.

Feeling the pain is the best way to respond to it. The further one is from the frontline, the less natural morality and ethics will prompt a humane response. We use products made by slave labour because we don't feel or see it. Civlizations need heirachries, but with better technology, we don't as much. Thus as civilization needs better technology, that inevitable means dismantling heirarchies is progress.

**The Power of Stories**: Aristotle's Poetics, and especially David Mamet's On Directing Film. Learning storytelling so darn well, it's layers and components, characters and motivations, is what I used to intepret Hegelian dialectics. I'm writing "How to See the Matrix" using these tools. It's much more detailed analysis of all this stuff.

**Ruling philosophy**: comes from Aristotle's regime. Regime is the form of government or the set of rules, cultural or social norms, etc. that regulate the operation of a government or institution and its interactions with society. Aristotle noted  the forms of government are democracy, oligarchy, aristocracy, monarchy. The supreme right to judge and decide is with with either a part or the whole of one or other of these governing powers; which together make up a socieyt's regmine or ruling philosophy.

A Democracy is a form of government under which the citizens distribute the offices of state among themselves, whereas under oligarchy there is a property qualification, under aristocracy one of education. By education I mean that education which is laid down by the law; for it is those who have been loyal to the national institutions that hold office under an aristocracy. These are bound to be looked upon as 'the best men', and it is from this fact that this form of government has derived its name ('the rule of the best'). Monarchy, as the word implies, is a rule which one man has authority over all. There are two forms of monarchy: kingship, which is limited by prescribed conditions, and 'tyranny', which is not limited by anything.

We must also notice the ends which the various forms of government pursue. The end of democracy is freedom; of oligarchy, wealth; of aristocracy, the maintenance of power, education, and national institutions; of tyranny, the protection of the tyrant.

**Protagonist and antagonist**: is Hegel's Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis dialectics. After centuries of histories, looked back at the trends, and said there was a ruling philosophy, whose problems manifested into a competitor, the two would eventually fight it out, and make a new ruling philosphy that merged the two together. He also said master–slave is a relationship that recurs throughout humanity, and is the reason we looked at Frederick Douglas and Neo, who while was the physical slave, his captors were the mental ones, bound to a horrible social system as much as Frederick was. Frederick's process of self-discovery, was how slaves realize their status and break free.

**Cyborgology, majic, frontline**: are Darwinism. The evolution of lifeforms based on their tools to collect resources. Life started out as simple organisms, and as these primitive lifeforms struggled to survive, they adapted better —biological—tools to do so. Eventually the benefits of biology maxed out with us, and so we have to continue evolution with tools. We similarly started to evolve (techvolve) with primitive tools, which slowly got better and better.

**Mixed Ideological Politics**: This didn't make it into ANP. But it's based on the separation of Church and State. Except now it's the separation of ideology and economy.

**The Death Star**: working insurance :)

**Freedom to use any tool**: Comes from freedom of religion and speech. John Locke and his A Letter Concerning Toleration, gets the nod here.

**Dark majic**: come from modern psychology. All of this is hard to understand. It seems simple because it's your life, and you think your opinions matter. But there's a reason we go to the doctor when we're feeling sick. They know the human antonmy, and we don't, even though we own one.

**Techvolution**: Comes from me. It synthesizes all that we've learned, into a new philosophy for a modern age. I attributed much of it to playing computer games, reading and watching science fiction, and working lots of frontline jobs. Playing, reading, and living in the future made the old philosophies of 20th Century politics so old fashioned. Putting it all together into a book took lots of reading, thinking, and working. Some intelligence helped, but it was the stubborness to keep going, and the belief in a higher power, that deserves the most credit. I hope it was worth it.

===

So, that's where it all came from. Machiavelli taught regular people to stop hoping for a better life, and start making one. Hobbes/Locke taught us our government can be instruments for liberty. Rousseau said we, the people, could make up government if we empowered our better natures. Hegel taught us the difference between Protagonsits and Antagonists, Player Gods, and Extras. Galileo taught us to use tools to see the Truth. Darwin taught us life is nothing but the evolution of new tools. And Majic, he taught us that technology is an extension of life, that player gods can use to improve this world, once we believe in ourselves. Or he wasted far too much time writing to himself. Either way, it's confusing and fitting Faith made him keep going.

I spent my 20's wondering what the next few pages of "A Student's Guide to Political Philosophy" were going to be. Even weirder, like Newton using his own eyes for lenses, I used myself as a proxy for life under the Life Star. A life of austerity, simplicity, childish honesty, great friendships, and self induced hypersensity to all frontline pain so easily brushed aside by extras. I feel confident to say I now know the next few pages of our political philosophy because I wrote and lived it; although I'd never pay the price again.

Cheers.
