# TECHVOLUTION: A NEW PHILOSOPHY

## Backpage

Are you happy? On the outside, Westerners have flashy products, full employment, and stable politics. On the inside, our middle-class deals with stagnate wages, crushing debts, antisocial behavior, political hatred, climate change. We have the freedom to vote Left or Right, moderate and extreme, and we've tried them all, but none have helped.

This book argues middle-class anxiety and unhappiness is a sign of a bigger problem. Our political ideologies were created in the Industrial Age, and since 1970, we've been in the Internet Age. Our own political beliefs are so outdated they can't help us solve our frustrating lifestyles and growing social problems. We need a new philosophy—one created to harness the remarkable potential of electronic tools.

Here it is. Its big lesson is this. The middle-class needs to step up and use digital technology to solve our own problems. If we don't, we'll keep suffering the pains of a civilization running on old ideological fumes.

## Dedication

_This book is for the people in the open-source community. For the collaboration philosophy you handed down to me. For selflessly updating Wikipedia, writing free software, and building cool new tech for us all. For being the protagonists of the Internet Age. You gave the best education a political guy can get. I hope I've learned enough to write this book for you._

_For the antagonists, the self-entitled delegators keeping Blockbuster—and it's Industrial Age mentality—alive, thanks for causing history to repeat itself yet again. I hope you learn something._

_This is especially dedicated to the extras on Main Street. Because when it's time for you to act, I pray you decide to play the game._

## Quote

"_We are really the revolutionaries in the world today—not the kids with long hair and beards who were wrecking the schools a few years ago._"

Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, 1973.

## Note to the reader

I used many videos and images throughout this book. They help explain information faster, so why not. Keep in mind some videos have sound, and you may have to enable. While I want to help creators and their audiences realize how historic their work is. Millions of regular people are communicating with no middle-men.  Of course, all credit for the media goes to them.

Also, I use Star Wars, Star Trek, Harry Potter, and other pop culture stories. If you're not a fan, don't worry too much. If we were in Ancient Greece, I'd use Greek Mythology. If we were in Victorian Britain, I'd use Shakespeare. Using familiar stories is a more natural way to explain between philosophy, politics, and real-life. Likewise, all credit goes to the media's owners.

# Introduction

## Politics

Donald Trump is the savior of Western Civilization. If that turns your emotions on, with tears or cheers, then you are missing the point of politics. Politics isn't voting for a political party, advocating for a political cause, and it's definitely not screaming at a TV. Doing all these things may change the world. But the government is so big, with so many politicians, civil servants, and interest groups fighting for control, it won't respond to your small voice. Tears or cheers don't make a person powerful.

Deciding how to live your life does. Because exercising, composting, teaching your kids mathematics does change the world. Good decisions change and improve your world—giving you freedom from dependency and control over your part of society. And power is to politics what money is to finance. Your personal choices are your most powerful political weapon.

The question is, how do we increase your powers. The answer, we'll find out in this book, is better technology, and the self-awareness to use it to improve your life. But this isn't a self-help book about making you "happy." It's about making you powerful so you can earn your happiness.

Because civilization needs you. The Internet Age is trying to grow, but the established powers of the Industrial Age is suppressing it. The middle-class has to grab hold of modern tools and work together to regain control of our society. It's the only way we'll upgrade our civilization and live happy lives again.

## Looking Up

Life improves with better technology. Deaths from disease, famine, and war have all gone down as our technological power has gone up. While naysayers love to spread depressing news about our world today, reading history is a reason to be optimistic. Plagues used to wipe out 30-80% of our population. Famines were expected as a fact of life. For crying out loud, the month of March is named after "marching" to war because our ancestors did it so often. We have many problems today, but our medicine, agriculture, education—our technology has empowered humanity with a wondrously healthy and safer life.

Now we have computers and the internet. They are game-changers. Computers are three million times faster today than just 50 years ago. The internet is likewise getting so much better. Modern technology lets us keep fighting off pandemics, hunger, ignorance, and war—but only if we use them to keep inventing, and staying ahead of our problems.

In Nature, lifeforms often evolve in jumps called eras or epochs. Likewise, humanity develops new technology in leaps; what we call "ages." When a new age comes, its technology is so unique and powerful, it changes how society functions. Things were very different in the Stone Age in comparison to the Bronze Age, for example.

Today we're going from the Industrial Age to the Internet Age. It can be hard to appreciate all the changes. There's a lot to think about when civilization's entire way of life upgrades to new technology. I've been thinking about our evolution for years and only now have a grasp.

Play computer games like _Age of Empires, Anno 1800_, and _Civilization_, and you'll get a great understanding of how humanity evolves. You'll be the "player god" of a civilization—a virtual divinity who knows all, sees all, and whose general will plays the game. As the player god, your job is to give orders, manage resources, invest in research, and finally decide when to click "upgrade." When you do, your civilization instantly transforms. Like magic, every house, factory, building, road, library, school is suddenly new and improved by the technology of a new age. Below, you'll see a person being the player god in the game _Anno 1800_.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/FragrantOldEmeraldtreeskink' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

The above is a game, of course, but it represents reality pretty well. We're all in there somewhere right now, trying to figure out how to earn a living while our society changes around us. Life is hard because there is no divine player and no magic button. Instead, we, the people inside the game, must collect the resources, do the research, and manually transform every part of our civilization bit by bit, with blood, sweat, and tears. We can't sit back, click, and watch. We must live it.

Improving technology is hard work, but at least we understand how to do research and development. Improving politics isn't so straightforward. Upgrading politics and philosophy is usually done with civil wars or revolutions. I want to help you understand your importance in it all. Because in 1970, personal computers and the internet came online. Since then, computer geeks, innovators, and hackers have been upgrading our society to the Internet Age. All the while, Industrial Age companies, and bureaucracies have been holding them back to keep their obsolete products and services alive.

And this is why middle-class life is unhappy. It's why we drive in endless traffic, over-pay for our homes, and can't understand the tax code. Middle-class life will only improve once we finish the Internet Age upgrade. There's no shortcuts, cheats, or gimmicks. There's just you and your friends on Main Street who have to do the work.

This book integrates lessons from the history, politics, and philosophy of prior upgrades, but it's not written for any buff. It uses the power of stories to help the middle-class see their duty to change the world. The first step is a new mindset. Because the people already have amazing smartphones, 3D printing, high-speed internet, and other digital tools. We only need to believe in modern philosophy to enjoy the wonders of the Internet Age.

## We Develop Modern Technology and Modern Philosophy

This book's cover page is a regular person standing on Main Street—a single guy or girl in civilization. His or her job is to do what's best for themselves, and help society prosper. The person is gazing up for guidance and sees two options; heroes and villains. In the sky high above is the mythical "player god", whose ultimately the one making the decisions. Will the player god act to benefit society or to benefit himself?

![Illustration](/img\sketches\playergod-stargazer.jpg)

In a computer game, when the player god decides to press "upgrade", society instantly transforms. In reality, we update society when we buy clothes, do car maintenance, and save up for a new home. Funny to think about, but our choices while shopping, dieting, and socializing, determine the health of our entire civilization. Yet we often don't think of ourselves as being "player gods." But that's the big picture, isn't it? That, in fact, it's all our individual choices that make up the player god in our real-life game of civilization.

The more individuals realize the big picture and act like their actions matter, the healthier their society. And the job of inspiring individuals to believe in the big picture is the job of philosophy.

So what the heck are good political decisions today? Who are the good guys? Every newspaper, politician, and political party says they're fighting for the good of our society. But politics has so much disagreement, disagreements, and fighting—how can a regular person know the difference between heroes and villains?

So there you are, on Main Street, looking up today, trying to figure if Donald Trump is evil, or if the United Nations is trying to make a world government. You ask if Fox News is manufacturing fake news, or maybe "all of them" are. If so, what's real news? The questions never stop. Should the government-run health insurance, or a big corporation regulated by the government? Is climate change real? If so, why does my "green" obsessed company force me to drive to work every day?

It's all very confusing and emotional. Yet you have to pick sides. After all, you're part of the player god as much as anyone else. Wouldn't it be cool if a philosophy showed you the difference between good and bad politics today? It is cool; it's calming to understand politics. And it's one reason why I wrote this book. So I, and whoever reads it, can better understand what's wrong with our society today. I also wrote this book to create a new philosophy. One that will upgrade our civilization—so we on Main Street can finally enjoy the greater independence, dignity, and freedom, of the glorious Internet Age.

## Your Politics Is Hard to See, Because You Are Changing

Philosophies are created to help organize civilization. They do so with high—and often hard to understand—ideals of a "just and good society." There are always lots of different philosophies to choose from. The trick is to pick one that empowers people to use modern technology to solve real-life problems, and hence give society a happy life.

When a player in a civilization game upgrades technology, we can see the changes. Installing a sewer, damning a river, building a road, is very obvious. But we can't see philosophy change so easily; because it's our own minds that keep evolving. Thus we have philosophical ideas in our head that we sometimes don't understand.

For example, we all believe in a philosophy of "Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." But we're unsure what that means in everyday life. Giving people more precise answers is what ideologies are for: Conservative or Progressive. Libertarian or Socialist. Republican or Democrat. All of today's ideologies idolize "Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." They each give their followers a list of policies to support like health-care reform, gun-rights, or capital gains taxes. Ideologues fight for your support by calling themselves heroes and the other villains.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/CandidFeistyBuckeyebutterfly' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

That's a technology tree. It shows how interlinked technology, tools, and philosophy are. Like picking up a new technology, society upgrades to a modern philosophy with a click. It's just so damn hard to see because it's our minds that are evolving.

That being said, it's simple to pick an ideology and fight for it. It's relatively easy to vote, watch TV, and listen to radio shows. But understanding our political views is entirely different. Few ideologues say, "My family is old money. I have a huge trust fund. So I'm coasting through life." Instead, that person says, "White privilege doesn't exist stupid!". Nobody says, "I'm gullible, and I work with lots of Liberal Arts graduates, so I don't like Trump because the crowd hates him." Instead, that person says, "Trump is not presidential!"

The point is, even with ideologies to guide our opinions, the real reason for our political views is hard to know. We all look up at the same ideologies; we all try to "think of the big picture," yet we arrive at different answers. Our opinions are a by-product of our psychology, job, skillset, family, geography, culture, ethnicity, religion, time-period. Who can understand how all these factors intermix to make a political opinion? Why does one parent cry tears of sadness, the other of joy, on the same election night?

I can't explain it either. But I can help you understand politics today. We live inside the story of civilization that spans thousands of years of technological upgrades. When humanity hits a new age, everyone becomes divided into the same cast of characters. The wealthy establishment struggles to retain power for themselves, the idealistic inventors fight to distribute power to the people, and the people on Main Street make a choice.

Does the regular person help the protagonists evolve civilization, or help the antagonists hold back progress? If you stay out of the fight, you help the establishment keep things the way they are and are thus an extra watching the story of civilization. If you decide to support the heroes upgrade humanity to the new age, you're a player god, playing the game of civilization. A player god is an activated and motivated extra.

We hit the Internet Age in 1970. Since then, computer hackers, geniuses, and geeks have been fighting to give the incredible power of electronics to Main Street. The people who control Industrial Age technology are fighting them off. And the people on Main Street have a choice, do they step up to help the good guys? That's a choice you, the person reading this right now, has to make. It's a choice as big as any you're ever going to make. Because if we don't upgrade now, it only means your kids and your grandkids will live even unhappier lives. The burden of transforming society falls on their shoulders.

A bit heavy to pull on your parental heartstrings, but it's true. Disease, famine, and war only stay away if we keep evolving, keep upgrading our technology. Life will keep getting worse until we update to the Internet Age. Don't worry. We can transform society without too much work or effort. The people only need to believe in a new philosophy. One that turns them all into player gods.

## We Change Our Minds Now, or We Lose the Game

Politics is emotional today. Maybe it's better to say people fucking hate each other, and many don't know why. They're just angry. And not in the "I stepped in the puddle" sort of way. Mad in the supervillain whose plans for world domination are going up in smoke "because the other side is ruining everything!" kind of way.

Let's get some perspective. Today, regular people are increasingly unhappy. We pick an ideology to help us. Conservatism and Progressivism are the big choices—both spanned the world on the back of the Industrial Age as it mass-produced property for the first time in history. Conservatives fight for a free, less regulated property creation marketplace, Progressives for fairer property redistribution system. This divide causes a tug of war over regulations, tax rates, subsidies, and other government policies. However, property creation and distribution are increasingly easy with digital technology. Digital books, knowledge, paperwork, money, and so on, is so much easier to create and distribute than physical property is. As our world becomes more virtual, Industrial Age mentalities grow obsolete.

But rather than rethink hundreds of years of "Left vs. Right" politics, ideologues double-down on their beliefs and blame the other for society's problems. Old-school businessmen rally their Conservative troops with constant stories of "fighting evil communists who are coming for your money!." De-regulation, tax-cuts, free-trade are right-wing rallying calls. In contrast, social justice warriors keep left-wing politics  gripping by "fighting racist fascists who want to oppress you!." Their choir forms around demands for justice, regulation, and the redistribution of wealth.

Fascism and communism (thankfully) died decades ago. Meaning few people, if anyone, call _themselves_ fascist or communist in Western societies. And if no one believes in these ideologies, no political community can exist based on them. Left and Right label their enemies fascist bigots, or crazy communists, to keep their own believers in the choir singing against "the other side." Fighting phantoms makes for excellent television.

Entertainment is their plan. Left and Right don't want regular people to become player gods of the Internet Age. They want their supporters to stay extras in the Industrial Age. Because neither Right or Left would hold their power in the Internet Age. When Main Street askes why their commutes are so long, home payments so high, bosses so many, Left and Right ramp up their spectacle. CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, and the rest put "Breaking News!" up to distract their believers for a little while longer. Blockbuster sequels and remakes do the same thing; they jack up special effects because their stories suck.

_In the Industrial Age, Left and Right used to cooperate all the time. Not anymore. This video excellently shows the growing hatred between both sides. It's about the US Congress but applies in every Western country. Notice how the divide started in the 1970s and has grown since. That's because neither Left or Right knows what to do in the Internet Age, so they blame each other for the society's growing list of problems. Growing hate is a terrible and worrying trend._

Sadly, the story of mutual hatred doesn't stop until old ideologies kill each other off. The Thirty Years War (1618-1648) is an all too good example. This was a war—during the Science Age—between the kingdoms of Europe, whose royal families justified their rule using a Medieval Age philosophy of "noble divine right to rule." Back then, every royal family was either Catholic or Protestant; these religions were the only ideologies Main Street could choose. Thus, when regular people demanded a better life, they picked a team and slaughtered "the other side" on behalf of supposed holy kings. The Thirty Years War can be summed up as; "a warning of the dangers of entrusting power to those who feel summoned by God to war, or feel that their sense of justice and order is the only one valid."

Main Street was so unhappy they kept fighting for no exaggeration, 30 years. The Thirty Years War was extremely brutal. One in five Europeans died from it. The carnage only stopped when both sides were totally exhausted. The worst part was when the horror ended, the people realized they were no better off—and what they were sick of all along was kings. Thus, it wasn't long until ordinary people finally upgraded to a new ruling philosophy. As player gods, they fought against Divine Kings, and for Democracy, in the American Revolution (1776), the French Revolution (1789), and many more afterward.

This should all sound scarily similar to our Left and Right ideologies today. Today's fights over presidential impeachments, disputed elections, and trigger words, are a smokescreen. Neither Right or Left can see or admit, they're both behind the times in the Internet Age.

It's important to remember, Conservativism and Progressivism helped us achieve great things in the Industrial Age. But philosophies can't be self-serving. Politics is only supposed to help people see the big picture—that all our individual choices matter.

Do people today watch TV or exercise at night? Do we eat healthy food or not? Do we seal our leaky taps or rant about climate change with another tweet? We are all a single person in the game. We can only change our own actions. And our efforts are pivotal. Because we are all the player god. Philosophy is only supposed to help people realize that.

For our society to see the big picture again, we need a new philosophy. One that looks ahead towards the boundless horizon of the Internet Age. One that considers the work of protagonists like Tesla, SpaceX, Blue Origin, as a sneak peek for the wondrous future each person should be building now, bit by bit.

I've studied this topic for years. Academically, at the University of Toronto, I studied political philosophy, history, and innovation. But I learned far more on the frontline as a projectionist, line worker, an account manager, and especially making a digital tool for an Industrial Age industry. I could have written this has a political theory or history book. Instead, it's written to the people on Main Street right now; here's how we fix our problems and win the game.

You'll like it best if you're sick of contemporary politics but love checking-out what Elon is up to. Because you'll understand most of today's problems that drive Left and Right to hatred, are with digital technology, simple engineering problems. Solving road traffic, rising health insurance, confusing tax-codes aren't like inventing time-travel. We can solve them and move on to something else. You'll really like this book if you know that unless we see ourselves in the video below, evolution will find someone who does.

Dreaming about our civilization's future is not a joke. If you hate technology, despise your job, think the world is unfair, see conspiracies everywhere, worry about climate change, are intimidated by the uber-rich... fine, you've spotted a problem. But now what? You are the player god in the game. Only you can make a difference, and we can only fix things with better technology.

So, you either see yourself in the video, or humanity will continue the blessed journey of civilization without you. I wrote this book to get you dreaming again. It's written to be like _New Atlantis_, _On Social Contract_, and _Common Sense_. All books that helped start modern democracies because they made unhappy people on Main Street realize the big picture. Our choices are our best political weapon, we increase our power by controlling society's technology. We're all the player god.

Today, if we don't step up to upgrade our philosophy to the Internet Age, we'll keep suffering the unknowns of a degenerating society. We'll be unhappy extras watching stories of phantom communists and fascists, instead of gazing up to a future as player gods in the stars.

And if we don't step up, at least with this book, we can read what we could have done as we regret the choices of player gods who lost because we refused to play the game.

## Here's the Grand Mission of Techvolution

Writer David Mamet once said being free from trying to please a group means being open to see Nature with nothing in the way. So I embraced being a regular guy and was quite ambitious when writing this book. Saying that Techvolution is divided into three parts:

**I. A New Philosophy**: This part upgrades our philosophy to the Internet Age. It gets Main Street to see the big picture; that we're all player gods who must use digital tools to solve our own problems.

**II. Building the Life Star**: Explains the new political and economic truth we'll see in the Internet Age with technologies like apps, bio-monitors, and big data. With these and other digital tools, we'll be able to create objective definitions of political and economic right and wrong. The Life Star will, therefore, remove phantom storytelling from our politics. In short, the Life Star will do for politics and economics what scientific instruments did for physics, chemistry, biology, etc. The troubling part is many people won't accept what this new telescope shows us.

**III. Starting Starfleet**: We'll design digital tools totally detached from the Industrial Age. As the Industrial Age's material abundance helped us live in so-called "perpetual peace." Internet Age products will make our lifestyle one of "perpetual profit." We'll send the massive savings to Musk and his protegees and hence jumpstart the Space Exploration Age—or as I like to say, "Start Starfleet."

===

Techvolution A New Philosophy has a pretty high goal. So, I want to be crystal clear about its purpose. We're in the new and wondrous Internet Age. But we're using the philosophy of the Industrial Age to run our society. Conservatism (1791), and Progressivism (1859) philosophy cards were clicked many years ago.

We need a new ruling philosophy. One built on the accomplishments of the past, but that factors in all the wondrous possibilities of digital technology. We need a philosophy that unites Main Street to again see the big picture; that they're player gods whose choices determine the health of their society. Watching TV isn't politics. Making good choices is politics. You should still vote and debate what's best for your community. But using digital tools to improve your life is your most potent political power—it's what the Internet Age protagonists are waiting for. If other people don't follow, get them on board. If they yell out in Twitter comments that "you can't change the world!" leave them behind. Evolution sure will. Because modern tools are the levers of power in every society.

The people on Main Street today thus have the responsibility to find tools to solve their problems, collaborate with others, and thereby solve the problems that plague today's middle class. The duty to solve problems also requires the freedom to choose any tool they want.

Tools can be anything: a thermal camera to spot leaky windows, the Waze app to lessen gridlock, or 3D printing a custom tool for your new local business. The desire to seek out new tools is human evolution. Human evolution first happens in the human mind that reads a modern philosophy telling it to become a player god. We've upgraded our philosophy many times before. This book is the best way I know how to do it for our society today. I hope it's good enough to click.

_These guys run a popular YouTube channel about computer hardware. They didn't like how YouTube changed in recent years and decided to make a new video service called Floatplane. They became protagonists, leading the way to help society solve a problem. That is real politics. Because it promotes evolution. It doesn't matter if Floatplane thrives or dies. We, as individuals, can only try new things and see what works. Supporting problem-solvers makes you a player god. Marching against climate change, screaming about Trump, or watching infotainment television is merely being an extra. The struggle within our society today is regular people don't think to act like protagonists or player gods. And even worse, it's often against the rules to because Industrial Age companies want us to keep using their stuff. We'll overcome these antagonists below._

# Prologue

## Fighting For The Internet Age - Our Philosophy is Already Generations Behind Our Technology

Since 1843, protagonists like Ada Lovelace, Vaneaver Bush, and John Bardeen were slowly inventing computers. At the same time, authors like H.G. Wells, George Orwell, Isaac Asimov imagined what life would be like after the Industrial Age ended. Books such as _The Time Machine, War of the Worlds_, and _I, Robot_ thought of a future so weird people called it science fiction. Then came the 1970s; when personal computers, the internet, email, and other digital technology became products anyone could buy. In 1970, humanity finally entered the Internet Age. And it was just as different as science fiction said it would be.

With every purchase, renovation, and Christmas gift since we've been upgrading our society with fundamentally different technology. Computers can be programmed, updated, and inter-linked. Digital property can be shared, erased, copied, and transferred with a few button taps. Just one laptop can be a typewriter, radio, voice recorder, book, television, photo album, database, and so many other machines. In contrast, mechanical tools of the Industrial Age are single-use, can't be easily shared, and need lots of manpower.

Left and Right governed and regulated the Industrial Age, but businesses did most of the work. Corporations populated the world with mass-produced mechanical products. Watch CNBC, and you'll see how competitive industrialized food, clothing, car, and other companies are in the international economy.

Digital devices enable a new philosophy, one that fosters not a competition, but collaboration. Using computers and the internet is our future because it saves us from the redundant work mechanical tools force on us. For example, with Wikipedia, the world can use one website for its general knowledge, instead of reprinting, shipping, and buying millions of encyclopedia books every year.

Now that we're several generations from the start of the Internet Age, items like smartphones, laptops, and smartwatches are standard. The collaboration philosophy they foster is increasingly part of our lifestyle. That's why websites like WikiHow, IMDB, and YouTube integrate so easily into our lives. Collaboration is today's big picture, the basic principle of the Internet Age's new philosophy. The people who see this best is the open-source community.

## Open-Source Protagonists Are Pushing Us Into the Internet Age

Open-source is a community of inventors, designers, and programmers. They are the successors of the first computer protagonists, Today they're leading us all into the Internet Age. They live, breath, and promote collaboration at places like GitHub, Wikipedia, Dribbble, Udemy, Stack Overflow, Unsplash, and Slack.

Open-source has given Main Street the levers of power to control the Internet Age. Even if the world doesn't know it yet. Most people on the frontline still think that retail stores, manufacturing, and education are industries only for governments or big businesses to control. However, because of the open-source community, there are countless new tools available for the people to take control of their own products, identities, and lives. Because of open-source, the Internet Age is indeed a new world. One where Cinderella can stop praying her fairy godmother gets her past the palace gates. Today she can go have fun because open-source gives everyone an invitation to the party.

The open-source community lives to democratize technology. Because Main Street can control levers of power, we can now share in our society's economic prosperity. Look around. Note the parents who are educating their own children on Khan Academy, the moms learning how to repair iPads for extra cash thanks to YouTube videos, the artists selling their own products on their own Wordpress websites, and the laid-off workers using Rails to make their own apps. Digital tools have turned many Industrial Age companies, products, and professionals into needless middlemen. Now regular people can work for themselves and collaborate directly with each other.

In short, the open-source community has empowered Main Street. No longer are we bound to be extras in the Industrial Age, hoping for a better life. Now we can become player gods in the Internet Age, making a better life.

I'm one of them. I'm a politics, history, and philosophy geek who spends far too much time thinking about this stuff. Digital tools let me write, research, host my own work. I can find and work with world-class writers and illustrators to add the professional touch. Heck, think of the connection between you, I. We're both collaborating about where to take the "player god" as I tell you my ideas about the future. With no middle-men and all for virtually free, because open-source heroes put new tools into both our hands.

## Mass Production Replaced by Mass-Collaboration Makes Us Happy

As a kid, I helped my family clean office buildings. My simple role was to pick up the garbage and blue bins. It was straightforward. Other than the still hating the smell of old coffee, I liked it, it taught me what honest work was. Years later, when working at a big office, the cleaners were short-staffed for a few weeks. Management spent hours meeting about and discussing the "garbage problem" instead of just wrapping it up (pun intended) and moving on.

Networking computers with the internet kickstarted the Internet Age. Likewise, attaching the steam engine to mechanical devices ushered in the Industrial Age. Mechanized wheels, lathes, drills, and presses powered the era of mass-production that populated the world with new and wondrous products. Mass-producing trains, clothes, and newspapers needed a lot of manpower. Which thus required a lot of managers. Look below, and you'll see a typical production line our ancestors worked.

Today we don't work on the assembly line with bulky steam engines or massive presses. Much of industrial production is automated (or, sadly, outsourced). Today, most people in the West work in hospitals, construction sites, or in an office. And software can now replace most managerial roles and let these workers collaborate directly. Mass-collaboration is to the Internet Age, what mass-production was to the Industrial Age.

Today's excessive management is a holdover from an age gone by. It's out of habit that our workplaces over-value control and delegation instead of contribution and collaboration. Excessive management turns leaders into gatekeepers. Managers want to control "get access" to things like news services, retail stores, formal education, and especially the higher "positions" of corporate employment. Today there's an entire class of middle-men, consultants, managers, and executives who don't know the skills of their industry like nursing, teaching, and (definitely not) cleaning. Their power is to manage an Industrial Age technology without the levers of power for itself as it puts gates up around workers and customers.

In contrast, the Internet Age demands mass-collaboration. Computers and the internet let anyone on the frontline, workers or customers, coordinate with each other. This is sometimes called "Wikinomics." Open-source shows us how easy and effective mass-collaboration is. The open-source community works together on a core technology. People then use the core technology to create their own specialized products.

![old philosophy in a new world](/img\diagrams\techvolution-open-source-projects.jpg)
_Some of the more famous open-source projects. Most of this software you can download use yourself for free._

For example, a large open-source community creates MediaWiki software. Then separate groups use MediaWiki to create Wikipedia, WikiHow, Fandom, and any other website you can think of. After all, MediaWiki is free for anyone to use however they want. And you don't have to be a programmer to contribute. Writers, designers, testers are all needed. Mass-collaboration is how Wikipedia wrote millions of articles in just a few years. It's also how Linux, Android, Chrome, and other excellent services work too.

This is not to say that open-source communities are perfect and can run the world. Some of its people are too rude, projects die off, personalities clash, and so forth. In _The Innovators_, author Walker Isaacson explains how the trifecta of academia, corporations, and militaries was optimal for creating the Internet Age. Likewise, it was the government, big business, and open-source organizing structures that keep pushing us into the digital future. Open-source is only a part of the ecosystem bringing the Internet Age and mass-collaboration to life. There will always be big companies like Microsoft, Ford, and Boeing with large corporate structures, always be government services running health care plans, and installing traffic lights.

That said, open-source is vital.

Precisely because nobody owns its technology. Server software, operating systems, web apps, and so much other software are free to use. That means Industrial Age gatekeepers can't stop digital inventors. Player gods will get more levers of power, collaborate more freely, and push us further into the Internet Age. Whether it's with a simple rotating list of persons to take out the trash. An online encyclopedia with millions of helpful articles. Or software to give society internet streaming—as when a few hackers tore down "Darth Blockbuster's" gate when he tried to keep us buying and borrowing his DVDs.

Open source is the good guys. The Jedi of our society. The modern minutemen because they enable individual empowerment and collaboration. They should be self-sufficient and very well-funded. But they are not. Many people in the open-source community who write articles, answer forum questions and make programs do it as a hobby, not a job. Even their leading organizations need donations to stay afloat. Meanwhile, Industrial Age companies such as universities, television broadcasters, and insurance companies get massive subsidies, tax credits, and bailouts.

To continue opening gates, building the era of mass-collaboration, and pushing us into the Internet Age, the open-source needs so much more support. We can't ask any more of them. These Jedi have done their job. Main Street needs to step up and flock to their banner and grab hold of the levers of power they've made for us. We will, once we become player gods.

_Figma is a website and design tool. In the past, designers, writers, programmers all spoke through many managers. With Figma and other products, worker-to-worker collaboration becomes easy. Your workplace can, and will, one-day foster worker-worker, and worker-customer collaboration like this. And it's open-source software that lets us build it._

## Fighting for The Future - The Era of Mass-Collaboration Won't Just Happen

Some people often call out "the establishment" or "the power brokers." Well, "they" are the Industrial Age companies and organizations. They're used to holding the levers of power as they run, operate, and control much of our society. They put up gates to maintain their power. Internet Age tools are younger, cheaper, and more democratic, but also not nearly as established. This difference signifies our society's significant problem. We should be jumping into the Internet Age. But open-source protagonists have to struggle against the odds to overcome the Industrial Age antagonists.

Once upon a time, I only wanted to learn about the open-source fight. Now I want to empower its protagonists. Mass-collaboration, telecommuting, the right to repair, home power generation, and real internet privacy are just the tip of the iceberg. A better world is waiting once the open-source community has the resources to not only make new digital tools but to replace old Industrial Age tools. The open-source community must get political, get mad, and learn to be selfish. Because they're the leaders in the age-old story about New versus Old. Protagonists versus Antagonists. Jedi versus Sith.

![old philosophy in a new world](/img\diagrams\suburbs-idealized.jpg)
_The American Dream, if you want to live in 1969 forever._

The most dangerous thing right now is ignorance. People don't know about open-source or the future they're fighting for. The people are stuck fighting phantoms on behalf of outdated Left vs. Right politics. Left leaders have their believers marching like it is Woodstock in 1969 and "fighting the system," while Right leaders tell their choir that the dream of a _Leave it to Beaver_ suburb will come back. Right/Left idolize 1969 because that was the end of the Industrial Age, and hence when they both peaked. Our civilization needs the people to stop chasing phantoms, and become player gods dreaming of the era of mass-collaboration.

To do it, Main Street has to believe in a new philosophy. One that gives society's levers of power to bakers and butchers over factory food owners. Tailors and seamstresses over sweatshops. Medics and nurses over hospital administrators. Engineers and designers over executives. Store owners and clerks over franchises. Craftsmen and repairmen over mass-produced projects. We'll only upgrade our civilization to the Internet Age when we network middle-class player gods on the frontline in the era of mass-collaboration.

_This is Louis Rossmann. He repairs broken computers. Some manufacturers make it hard to improve our machines because they want us to replace them instead. Louis saves the middle-class money. Even better, advocates for customers having the "right to repair." Because of digital technology and open-source, regular people like Louis can use advanced repair software, collaborate with supporters, and thereby change his society. Another example of a player god doing real politics. Whatever you think is essential, from wasted tax money to underfunded public education, you can fight back with computers. If you become a player god._

## Open-Source Lets Us Bust Open Gates And Start The Internet Age

Currently, when you phone a call center, everything is recorded. The company has access to the recording; you don't. Likewise, when the employee logs in and out of the office, that, too, is recorded. Management automatically has access to these timesheets; the employee doesn't.

Access to things like phone recordings and timesheets are gates to the levers of power. They're holdovers from the mechanical tools of the Industrial Age. They needlessly give power to one person over another. Customers can't confirm what was agreed to during their last phone call, and employees can be grilled for a long lunch. Yet, the same manager quickly forgets unpaid overtime.

A lopsided balance of power allows customers and employees to be taken advantage of and encourages mistrust, bad products, and inefficient workplaces. Uneven power makes collaboration impossible.

The greatness of the digital tools of the open-source community is threefold. First, it sets a great example because it entrusts everyone with all available information. Second, open-source wants more members, so the community loves to bust open gates to get more people in. And third, since no one owns open-source technology, the people can empower ourselves with tools once only big companies could have—like call recordings and timesheets.

Distributing the levers of power moves us into the Internet Age. It equalizes the balance of power. It treats people like adults and expects them to act like it, and therefore fosters collaboration. We have the technology to do this now in our insurance contracts, tax-laws, employment agreements. We need the people to step up, participate, and demand it.

Once we do, all workers—from waitresses, mechanics, and teachers—will start to be managed less and collaborate more. Mass-collaboration will be similar to how factories and production lines swept across our society during the Industrial Age and the era of mass-production.

![old philosophy in a new world](/img\diagrams\techvolution-github-repo-rails.jpg)
_This is the GitHub "repo" for Ruby on Rails, the technology that runs apps like Basecamp, Airbnb, and Shopify. A core team of paid pros from these companies do much of the programming. But all programmers, from elite to novice, individually ask questions, find bugs, contribute their work, and it all comes together via GitHub's software with minimal supervision. The process works similarly to Wikipedia. It's very organized; even with over 5,000 contributors over 15 years, you can see who has done what and when. Ruby on Rails software is priceless and is yours to use however you want. And it's easy to make use of once you decide to try. Get familiar with how open-source works. It's a tell-tale sign for the openness, responsibility, and immense value of all work cultures coming in the Internet Age. You should be happy! Once you experience how easy, effective, and powerful worker-to-worker collaboration is, it makes work much better. And the best part, no garbage meetings or delegators are needed._

## The Setup to our Story — Making Techvolution and Player Gods

We all have to step up and upgrade our way of life to the Internet Age. We have to grab hold of the levers of power the open-source community has made for us. If we don't, we'll keep suffering the pains of a degenerating society. This means Main Street has to stop watching phantom communists and fascists on television. Regular people must believe in Techvolution, the new philosophy that makes them player gods who take control, and responsibility, for their culture.

The biggest roadblock to the Internet Age is Darth Blockbuster, the self-entitled holdover from the Industrial Age. He antagonizes the future by making up rules to keep his Industrial Age tools, and himself, in power. These rules are like a Death Star meant to keep Main Street away from a happier life in the era of frontline mass-collaboration. Before our civilization can upgrade and evolve, we need to defeat Darth Blockbuster and his Death Star.

And that's the set-up to the story of your life. Will you become a player god and take on our antagonists? Will you fight to control the tools of our society? Everyone is welcome. Anyone can do it. It's not at all dramatic to say this, the fate of your life, children, and civilization is weighing in the balance. I'll explain the philosophy you need to win the fight, but whether or not you decide to pick the right side, is up to you.

## Cast of Ideas and Characters

Before we plunge into the story of Techvolution, here are a few terms that will put us all on the same page:

===

**Player god**: Imagine a person playing a computer "civilization building" game with our society. They would hold all the levers of power and thus decide where to put roads, what to teach our kids, or when houses all get solar panels. Of course, there is no such player. In reality, it's the choices of individuals that decide what the community does. Player gods make-up the collective consciousness of society—but only if Main Street decides to become player gods and take responsibility for their nation. If we do, we "play the game" of civilization, evolve as required, and win.

**Philosophy**: The largely unspoken ideals that tell individuals what's right and wrong, good and bad, in science, art, morals, politics, and economics. Philosophy is supposed to unite individuals to see the big picture; that everyone's choices matter, because everyone is a player god.

**Ruling philosophy**: A civilization's chosen philosophy. One that all factions/ideologies agree on. Examples include the "Divine Rights of Kings," derived from Christian theology and used in royalist Europe; "Marxist-Leninism" of the Soviet Union; and the combination of "Right/Left" philosophies of the Western world today. The ruling philosophy is supposed to help society win the game of civilization.

**Happiness**: The test of how well the ruling philosophy is doing its job.

**Rulebook**: The written and unwritten social, workplace, and legal rules that govern everyday life. The rulebook is interpreted from the ruling philosophy.

**Technology**: A catchall term for things we make tools from, like concrete, lumber, nails, shingles, insulation, and bricks.

**Tool**: A catchall term for things we create with technology to solve a problem, like guns to kill bad guys, books to record and pass on knowledge, and houses to shelter in. The latest and most powerful tools are society's levers of power.

**Frontline**: The point of contact between a tool and the problem. Nurses giving vaccines, cleaners cleaning a city bus, and soldiers on the battlefield are all examples of frontline settings. People on the frontline work on Main Street with jobs that solve specific problems with a demonstrable skillset. Today the frontline is waiting for the era of mass-collaboration to start.

**Hierarchy**: A power structure that manages every tool's use by society. Kings and queens with the keys to the castle, or the corporate ladder at Blockbuster controlling DVD rentals, are examples of hierarchies. As hierarchies grow larger, the bigger its authority gets, but also the more detached it gets from the frontline. People in the regime have titles like prince and executive, baron, and supervisor to mark their position—and, in a sense, their territory and "rights" in the power structure.

**The game of civilization**: The invention of technology, and the creation of tools, to overcome frontline problems. Civilization develops fundamentally new technology and tools in ages. As the player god adopts these tools, they topple the hierarchies of the prior era. We use tools to evolve.

**Protagonists**: People who invent, spread, and use new technology and new tools for the greater good. Usually close to the problems on the frontline, they individually struggle. Still, their continued self-sacrifice slowly and collectively improves life on Earth. I call them this world's Jedi knights. We call their leaders trailblazers who often skirt the rules. Galileo, Nikola Tesla, Jay Last, Michael S. Hart, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Linus Torvalds, and Elon Musk are among their number.

**Antagonists**: People who selfishly defend their wealth, power, and prestige atop a hierarchy. Antagonists manage companies or institutions based on dated technologies and think that working on the frontline is beneath them. They work to control the rulebook, so they use it to keep new tools from the hands of Main Street. We don't often individually identify them. I coined the term "Darth Blockbuster" so we can.

**Extras**: Everybody in the middle of a battle between antagonists and protagonists. Because they have no direct loyalty to either side, extras can pick winners and losers. Usually, extras are in the middle class, not so poor as to be desperate, but not so powerful that they want to keep the world the same. Sadly, extras don't realize their power. When they do, they become player gods. If they don't, they stay extras, and the game of civilization turns into a story they merely watch. Extras blame phantom ideologies for their real-life problems.

**The Death Star**: The rulebook when it's controlled by Darth Blockbuster. Today it exists inside countless regulations, agreements, contracts, laws, and manuals that prevent new digital tools from being used by people. Today, the Death Star works to keep the Industrial Age alive.

**Techvolution**: A new philosophy empowering seamless human technological evolution by ridding Darth Blockbuster of his power, by giving regular people the right and duty to decide when society should upgrade our tools.

**The Life Star**: A rulebook based on Techvolution, governed by human technological adaption and natural selection that makes sure humanity never stalls when upgrading to the next technological age.

**Plot**: Getting the extras to step up, grab hold of society's levers of power, and become player gods. They do this by replacing their ruling philosophy with Techvolution to establish the era of mass-collaboration inside the Internet Age.

# ACT ONE

## The Beginning

It all started with a door in my face. And then, actually, a few more. I was either being too stubborn or too hopeful. Either way, I eventually learned my lesson. I was selling a web app that those in upper management weren't going to buy.

Before you wonder, it wasn't a matter of price, because there was no price. It wasn't a question of competition. None of that either. And I can promise it worked, because I had spent years in a cubicle doing the frontline job it serviced. After years of thinking about political and economic theory in the Internet Age, I'd written a book (Starting Starfleet) about some untapped possibilities of new tech like smartwatch apps, bio-monitors, and bitcoin. I only made this simple web app (using open-source technologies) to validate some of my ideas.

I was right to. They were good ideas. I figured out how to solve a problem and save 100 million dollars, 300,000 hours of worker productivity, and even dozens of lives. All I did was enable worker-to-worker collaboration with an app that was virtually free. Why wouldn't I want to tell people about the theory behind it?

Sadly, I was a fool. I didn't know it at the time, but I wasn't even knocking on doors. I was knocking on gates. See, I wasn't talking to the frontline workers (who thanked me). But to the bureaucrats, lawyers, managers, and executives who were well paid to "meet, discuss, delegate" about such "garbage problems." As they were holdovers from the management of the Industrial Age, I went against all they stood for; solving their problems was asking them to fire themselves. Worse, I was asking them to invalidate their identity as being "superiors." They put up gates to shut out, not promote, Internet Age innovation. The levers of power, even small ones, are theirs by right.

In retrospect, all this antagonism was damn exciting. I was standing at a historic moment in time. Here the Industrial Age was taking its last stand against human evolution.

That's why the head office people never said no to me. No needs a reason. Instead, they simply said it was against the rules to say yes. You know—those obscure rules, hidden inside regulations and contracts. They believed in the rules, especially the one against frontline workers deciding on their own tools, holding their own levers, and taking out their own garbage, so to speak.

Like anyone, I knew bringing new products to market is hard. I knew sales is difficult. I even knew antagonists exist. But I didn't realize how strongly the Internet Age was being held back. Antagonists do a good job masking their self-interest with self-righteous rules. In their eyes, I wasn't an innovator helping his society win the game, but just an "uppity extra" stepping out of his place in the hierarchy.

I don't want to talk about my experience too much. All that's important is this. There was a huge problem costing millions of dollars, weeks of workers' time (lots of it unpaid overtime), and maybe even your life. And it was against the rules to solve it. Even if I had won this battle for the Internet Age, it would be a tiny victory.

So instead, I'm going to talk about winning the war. Our hospitals, schools, airports, roads, our entire way of life is being held back from the Internet Age by a group of self-entitled holdovers of the Industrial Age.

So I learned my lesson and wrote this book. Because despite already having the digital technology to transform our way of life, antagonists maintain gates all over the place to protect the pre-digital "Woodstock of 1969" way of life. They know—even if subconsciously—they lose their managerial status, executive positions, and superiority complexes in an Internet Age mass-collaboration economy. Being held back from this brighter future is why our lives are so unhappy. To improve our days then, the people need a new ruling philosophy... one that says improving our society is the only rule that matters.

## To Upgrade Our Civilization We Need To Reach for the Tools

Do you love stories? I think it’s a safe bet to say that you do. Who doesn’t? They entertain us after a hard day of work, bring us together to share our joys, and (my favorite) open our minds to the different rules and philosophies of foreign cities, mythical worlds, and galaxies far, far away.

Stories are so powerful because they’re so simple. Protagonists are good because they want to fix a problem. Antagonists are bad because they don’t. Stories aren’t debates. We take the protagonist’s side. Thus, Romeo and Juliet’s love is beautiful and worth dying for, while their families’ feud is ignorant and stupid. Luke Skywalker’s rebellion is righteous and worth fighting for, while Darth Vader’s empire is wicked and should be destroyed.

Our moral clarity about a problem turns the protagonists into our heroes and the antagonists into our villains. We thus follow their story in act one, two, and three with strong emotions; which burst out at the climax as we find out who wins.

Our hero fights hard to defeat the bad guys, but his superior morality, justice, and heroism aren’t enough. He’s often too weak or unskilled, and the villain beats him bloody. On the verge of failure, the hero needs to find something that’ll turn the tide in his favor. He seeks, sees, and reaches for his salvation: a tool or a weapon, like a gun, magic book, or lightsaber.

Will our hero reach it first, or will the enemy? We in the audience, like extras in the story, hold our breath because the story’s society is controlled not by desires, opinions, or rules, but by which character holds the tools. The wielder is the victor. The victor writes the rules. It’s the lesson that we the people need to learn for ourselves. Reaching, and holding the tools—the levers of power—is how we stop being extras and start being player gods who upgrade our civilization to the Internet Age.

![old philosophy in a new world](/img\diagrams\levers-of-power.jpg)
_The holder wins._

## Player Gods Reach for the Tools and Don't Chase Phantoms

We think the rules, regulations, and laws of society control our destiny. They don't. I'll show you why.

Talk to any political junkie, no matter when, and they'll say there's a big election coming up. They'll say something like, "if the red team wins this one, then education, healthcare, infrastructure, and everything else will go to shit." What he means is elections decide the rule-makers, and that blue rules make a good society while red rules make a bad one.

If you buy it—and most of us have at some point—you watch blue cable news, read blue blogs, listen to blue talk radio. You start seeing phantom enemies everywhere because you've filled your head with blue's philosophy. Soon enough, your car has blue bumper stickers, and you're waving blue bristol boards while screaming blue chants at rallies, marches, and protests. You feel like a hero! You're fighting against the evil red philosophy!... Or, if you got sucked in by the other side, evil blue philosophy!

Let me ask you this: if you're a regular middle-class person and you ignored the election, how much would you bet that you would know who won just by continuing to live your life?

When Team Blue wins, does traffic suddenly disappear? When Team Red succeeds, does everyone suddenly exercise? Do you breathe fresher air or see fitter neighbors? Do your real-life problems get solved when one color's philosophy writes the rules?

It's impossible, because policies, manuals, and guidelines aren't the levers of power Left/Right tell us they are.

Being a believer in red/blue philosophy doesn't change your fate any more than praying for rain does. If you want to stay an extra, you can return to the many pundits, columnists, and commentators waiting to sing to their choir, telling you to fight "the enemy" until you're literally blue in the face.

If you don't like the choir, or you're starting to realize the "other side" are a part of the same struggling middle class, keep reading. This book will turn you into a player god of the Internet Age.

The first thing to realize is whichever color wins an election this year or the next and re-writes the rules; regular people will still pay taxes, have a huge mortgage, waste hours in traffic, pay increasing energy bills, sleep less than they're supposed to, get confused by their health insurance, apply for jobs with no information on the work culture, endure customer abuse, get micro-managed, and hope their job (which they likely hate) isn't downsized or outsourced. Under blue or red rules, the middle-class still struggles because our Industrial Age lifestyle stays the same.

Phantom communists or fascists are not to blame. Nothing changes when Main Street elects Conservatism or Progressivism, because they don't know how to usher in the Internet Age.

It's not our politicians' fault. Red and blue philosophies were created at the start of the Industrial Age. A time when humans only had a few tools at hand. Red/blue philosophical fathers like Adam Smith, Edmund Burke, John Stuart Mill, and Karl Marx never had running water, listened to the radio, made a phone call, opened a fridge, took penicillin, started a motor, typed on a keyboard, or learned about evolution.

![old philosophy in a new world](/img\diagrams\techvolution-mud-roads-sail-boats.jpg)
_Cutting edge technology when Left/Right were born._

Instead, our Right/Left philosophical fathers had mud roads, grandfather clocks, and abacus calculators. Being hungry and sick, cold, and ignorant was a way of life back then. Right/Left philosophers dreamed of improving this primitive world with better tools. And, truth be told, they did! These philosophies got our ancestors to agree on the same "big picture"; everyone needed to industrialize society via mass production. Soon society upgraded to steam engines, sanitation systems, science labs, telephone networks, broadcast televisions, and computers the size of rooms.

During the Industrial Age, the people needed to be managed inside huge corporations and color-coded parties. Although calling factory workers player gods may seem silly, someone needed to be on the factory floors and filling the desk jobs using primitive tools to make better ones. To their credit, the blue and red philosophies at least gave regular people a voice in how their factories, regulations, and profits were controlled.

Today, however, we live inside the world the Industrial Age dreamed of making. We've grown a massive ecosystem of cities, factories, offices, telecommunications, and layers of infrastructure. The Industrial Age has done its job. It's time to transform the people into player gods using the digital tools they worked so hard to create.

Happily, we already are. That's the reason we're so addicted to new technology. Checking news feeds, flying drones, taking endless photos, playing computer games are acts of extras learning the tools of player gods. Our ancestors did the same when learning about printed books, telescopes, and muskets. Those were merely addictive toys until new philosophies turned them into the lightsabers that brought down Darth King and the Medieval Age. It was mastering new tools, the new levers of power, that let Main Street to read unknown history, see the universe for themselves, and revolt against royalty.

Our so-called addicting toys really unused levers of power. We can use these proverbial lightsabres to earn a happier way of life. We will, once we forget about Left/Right's phantoms, and use Techvolution to defeat Darth Blockbuster, his Death Star, and upgrade to the Internet Age.

_Here's a sample of red/blue leaders both singing to the choir. Since both Right and Left ideologues can't make Floatplane, or repair your broken laptop, or make any product you might need, they distract with bickering instead. This bullshit only works as long as you listen._

## Once We Believe in a New philosophy, We'll Reach for the Stars

Darth Blockbuster appears everytime we upgrade to a new age. He tries to convince the people to chase ideological phantoms, instead of reaching for the power of new tools. To fight the antagonists off, we need a modern philosophy. Here's one example.

When you look up at the night sky, you see a dazzling show. It can seem to defy explanation. But even with the naked eye, you'll see trends. The stars never move, some "objects" (really planets) look to be wandering, and it looks like the Moon, Sun, and everything else revolves around you. With all this evidence, our ancestors were sure Earth was the center of the Universe. So much so, it was a pivotal part of the "Divine Rights of Kings" philosophy that ruled Europe during the Medieval Age (500-1400).

When you look at the night sky with a telescope, like Galileo (1564-1642) did in the Renaissance (1400-1600), you see it differently. Jupiter has moons, Venus has phases, and it looks like Earth is just another planet. When Galileo told everyone these facts, the "divine kings" were threatened. By using a telescope, Galileo was saying, "we don't know until we test, so let's use instruments to test what we think we know." Scientific inquiry questioned the ruler's divine leadership. Although Catholics and Protestant political leaders hated each other, they worked together to suppress Galileo. Neither facilitated the new truths, his new tools were discovering.

Galileo is just one example of how an establishment finds it very hard to embrace a new era. The lesson is, to enter into a new age, civilization can't just use new technology. Main Street must welcome a modern philosophy too. Today we're also using an outdated Left/Right philosophy. Here's an example of how that's hurting our daily lives.

Space travel is a significant step for humanity. It means better satellites, worldwide internet accessibility, and ensuring intelligent life doesn't put all its eggs in one earthly basket. All possible _if_ we can build an affordable rocket.

Left/Right political culture was unable to deliver an affordable rocket. They can gossip about speeches all day, but rocket science doesn't fit into soundbites. It was private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin (funded by a few rich protagonists) who answered the call. They harnessed digital technology and fostered collaboration to make rockets 10 times cheaper then Left/Right politicians were doing. The protagonists even learned to land their rockets so they can be reused, a monumental achievement that makes space travel even more possible. But many people, especially Left/Right politicians, still didn't care.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/DeliriousOffbeatHedgehog' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

_This was when SpaceX landed its first rocket. Enable the sound to really get a feel on how important this event was; a significant step for the Internet Age._

When you're dependent on old philosophies, you're also confined to its old tools and live within its old narratives. Inside the establishment, you start thinking your own rules should control society, and thus you suppress new tools. Today Left/Right politics obsesses over tax cuts, pages of government regulations, and endless media soundbites because their philosophy says they're essential. New and super-powerful technologies like SpaceX are talked about, but more as a novelty act that falls beyond the believers of old philosophies comprehension and comfort zones.

That's the power of philosophy. It filters the definition of good and bad for its followers. Today, Left/Right Industrial Age philosophies hold back the incredible, world-changing, happiness granting potential of the Internet Age. Affordable rockets are just one example. Up and down our economy, we use Industrial Age heavy management practices when digital collaboration is far better. The lesson is, once we believe in a philosophy that embraces the Internet Age, we'll control our society's true levers of power, and soar to the stars.

![old philosophy in a new world](/img\diagrams\techvolution-missing-the-boat.png)
_Here’s a screenshot from my Twitter feed when SpaceX landed its first and second rockets. At the exact same time, Left ideologue Bernie Sanders was ranting about regulation battles with Wall Street. He should have been taking a minute to appreciate all the new solutions SpaceX just opened to humanity. I happened to be following Sanders, so I don’t mean to pick on him. The middle-class needs to stop putting their faith in old philosophies and instead become player gods with the amazing new tools digital protagonists are giving us today. Like we followed Galileo generations ago._

## Techvolution is a Fight as Natural as Evolution

Fighting to upgrade our ruling philosophy is a classic human story. It happens every time we start a new technological age. It happened when Galileo fought a religious establishment with a telescope, George Washington fought a political establishment with a musket, Steve Jobs fought an economic establishment with an iPod.

We are embracing this history lesson. But note that this is not a book about how to invent tools. Amazing books like _Rework_ and _Zero to One_ already do that. Nor is this a book about the history of invention; _The Innovators_ does that better than I could dream of doing. And if you want brilliant critiques of our society, _The Incerto_ and _The Great Degeneration_ are waiting for you.

This book is about pushing us into the Internet Age with a new philosophy that encourages our evolution. Nature thus inspires Techvolution. Notice that gatekeepers don't exist in our world's ecosystems. Evolution doesn't have anyone telling a cheetah she's running too fast, that the ants are too cooperative, or that a camel is too water-efficient. Individual lifeforms adapt to their own problems. There are no middlemen and no gatekeepers, just problem solvers. And the problem solvers live on.

Human biological adaptions take so long, however, that ours have effectively stopped. We'll never biologically evolve to fly, do advanced calculations, or breathe Martian air. Humanity continues life's evolution with tools. We're basically cyborgs who adapt by upgrading our tools to the latest problem in transportation, calculation, and breathing. Hold a spear then a gun, an abacus then a calculator, a plane joystick then a space ship joystick, and you're a different and more powerful cyborg each time.

Nonetheless, our problem solving is held back when gatekeepers of a bygone age hold back civilization's upgrades. This is the equivalent of Blockbuster getting to write rules to keep us renting DVDs instead of saving time and money with YouTube and Netflix; basically, the opposite of evolution.

This classic battle between good and evil fills stories from Greek Mythology to Shakespeare. Today the most famous story is Star Wars, so I use it in this book. Star Wars is about a galaxy with an all-powerful energy field called the Force. Luke Skywalker's Jedi warriors' harness "the light side" to help others. Darth Vader's evil Sith lords' harness "the dark side" to help themselves and hurt all who oppose them.

In our world, we like to call our protagonists "trailblazers". But we don't have a political name for the antagonists. Gatekeepers are often corrupt, but sometimes gates are good, and often, these people are just doing their job. Thus, I collectively call the antagonists to our technological evolution Darth Blockbuster: people who actively and knowingly prevent human evolution for the sake of their self-interest.

Since biological adaptions and upgrades are evolution, I've called human technological evolution Techvolution. This book is about inventing Techvolution; the new ruling philosophy empowering Main Street to solve problems with technology as smoothly in human society as other lifeforms do with adaptation and natural selection.

## Taking an Uber, Learning About Collaboration

Have you ever taken an Uber? If you haven't, it's a smartphone app that connects a person needing a ride, with a person willing to drive them. So say Julia needs a lift. She opens up Uber and inputs where she needs to go. Uber assigns Jack to pick her up. Julia and Jack are now connected and can see each other's history, rating, vehicle, and GPS location.

Jack drives Julia where she needs to go. They can talk or not, it doesn't matter. Once there, Julia gets out. Uber manages the payment, and Julia and Jack rate each other and then go about their lives.

That's an Uber ride. And if you've ever taken one, you've participated in Internet Age mass-collaboration. Seriously, think about it. Julia needed to get somewhere; a friend's house, job interview, babysitting. Jack helped her get there for some money. And software facilitated the collaboration between two strangers.

Once upon a time in the Industrial Age, this coordination was done by many managers at taxi, media, and automotive companies. Driver timesheets, dispatch call-centers, complaint resolution, company marketing, vehicle licensing. In the Internet Age, all this paperwork is handled by Uber's (mostly open-source) software. The company Uber still has to staff managers, marketers, executives, and whatnot. But the proportion is far less.

While Darth Taxi-Cab tried to stop Uber in court and government lobbying, it didn't work. The people liked Uber too much. Once people use it, mass-collaboration is too practical to be stopped. It's something to keep in mind while you're reading this book. Our way of life will get better. Once we become player gods who realize their actions, even if just catching a lift, upgrades their civilization. to the Internet Age.

## Nice to Meet You, Stargazer

So you have to become a player god. If no one does our culture fails and we become like ancient Greece, Rome, or Mayans. Memories for others to learn from.

It's true. That's why, whoever you are, and wherever you are on this Earth, I'm calling you Stargazer. It's a name in honor of ancestors like Copernicus, Bruno, and Galileo, who toppled Darth King by looking up at the stars and asking questions. These giants took on the responsibility to advance civilization and let evolution deal with the the naysayers.

You can topple Darth Blockbuster. Not only do you already wield many much power with smartphones, hi-speed internet, and eReaders, you hold the most power lever of power in our society. From hospital cleaners to internet technical support, from engineers to claims adjusters, you are at the frontline. Remember when I said, power is to politics what money is to finance. Well being on the frontline is why you're so important. Only you know the exact tools we needs to finish the Internet Age upgrade. The daily pain of real work gives you knowledge. Knowledge makes you powerful. Frontline knowledge is the lever of power Darth Blockbuster will never have.

That's why you, Stargazer, are the hero of Techvolution. Don't be surprised. Average Joes and Janes are always the heroes. Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Neo, and Cinderella were all regular people. Heroes aren't born. They're stargazers, dreamers, believers, and achievers. They become heroes when they step up to defeat the bad guys. I'm like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Morpheus, or the fairy godmother, merely a guide to teaching you how to overcome the villains. So, the time is now, Stargazer, to leave the farm and join the rebellion.

The rebellion I speak of might be different than what automatically comes to mind. It is not a physical revolt. It does not involve rallies, marches, or protests. It's a rebellion of the mind. The Internet Age is held back by Darth Blockbuster and his Death Star rulebook. We feel the Internet Age in our hearts but are forced to live in the Industrial Age in our lives. To earn our happiness, we need to turn you into a Internet Age player god. But to do that, you have to feel the click of "eureka!", i believe in Techvolution, and the freedom to evolve humanityto the Internet Age, is worth fighting for.

## Techvolution Builds on the Past

The world's on your shoulders, Stargazer. But let's take a minute and ease some of the burdens. First off, the world is always on your shoulders. Organizations like "the government" and "the market," say they're going to be there for you, but we all know that's a marketing promise more than a reality. Being a player god means taking extreme ownership of your life because your actions are always the best way to improve your life.

Exercising, saving for a rainy day, helping a customer understand their loan application, buying locally grown produce. These are actions of a player god. And they're not that complicated. So while yes, being a player god is hard, it's also rather straightforward. And many of us are doing it already.

The difference with Techvolution is, we expect ourselves, and each other, to behave more responsibly. More importantly, we demand the freedom to take responsibility for our home and work lives whenever a Sith Lord says helping our society is against the rules.

But none of this means you Stargazer have to re-invent society. We aren't throwing away any philosophy you, or anyone else, may believe in. Old philosophies, Protestant/Catholic, Right/Left among them, will always teach us lessons, help us do our jobs better, and enlighten our personal opinions. The ideals and openness of Progressivism helps bring new peoples into Western culture, while giving a helping hand to those already inside. The practicality and steady hand of Conservatives helps insure our society keeps working. Moreover, each side has immense undestanding of complex fields like monetary policy, farm regulation, labor relations, and more. This single book can't replace all that knowledge. It would be laughable to suggest it could.

But no one should let the rulebooks of old philosophies determine right and wrong when up against a person's right to evolve on the frontline. Like voting our interests in elections, we the people on the frontline today need the freedom to decide which tool best solves a problem. The right and duty to evolve must trump all other considerations. Today old philosophies should not be our ruling philosophy simply because they weren't created with the Internet Age in mind.

Giving old philosophies, or people whose power and prestige is based on old tools, the power to decide when we upgrade our tools is a recipe for staying in the Industrial Age forever. Delayed upgrades is why the middle-class is getting beat up by relatively simple problems like road traffic, waiting on hold, and confusing warranty contracts.

We're already starting to use digital tools to improve our lives. YouTube product reviews. Wikipedia articles. Cutting off cable and using Netflix. But there's so much more to do. By controlling modern tools, the middle-class is taking control of society's levers of power. Watning to control their lives, instead of chasing Right/Left phantoms, is the rebellion inside our mind we need to establish the Internet Age.

That's why controlling tools is the Nature of all political battles. Whether in galaxies far far away, street fights in parking lots, wars between nations, or your own life. It's why antagonists make new tools against the rules. And why I needed to write a book to remind everyone philosophies and rules are supposed empower player gods and serve human evolution, not get in its way. But since many rules stall the Internet Age upgrade Stargazer, we must pack our bags, rally our friends, and get ready for a fight. It's time to blow up a Death Star.

_This is good politics. A regular person using a modern tool to improve his life, increase his power, and improve his civilization. Isn't that the person you'd want in your society if you were playing the game of civilzation? And once we've done our daily work, we can play basketball, watch a movie, or do whatever else we want. Just don't chase phantom communists or fascists. You're better off sealing that drafty window._

# ACT TWO - BLOWING UP THE DEATH STAR

## When Rules Are In Our way, We Use Evolution to Defeat Them

Life's been evolving for billions of years. Humanity continues life's evolution by creating technology. We develop new and better tools in stages like the Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Industrial Age. Unfortunately, transitioning between stages is hard. Human nature being what it is, the powers of the old age hold back the modern era. Since we've entered the Internet Age in 1970, Darth Blockbuster has continuously defended his mechanical tools by making digital tools against the rules.

Some examples. In the 1970s, AT&T defended its telephone monopoly by successfully lobbying the American government to ban internet modems. In 1984, the broadcast television industry tried to ban video cassette recorders (VCRs) and only lost by one vote in the Supreme Court. In 2001, the music industry defended compact discs (CDs) by successfully suing Napster for giving people digital songs. Likewise, Tesla, Uber, Airbnb's most significant competition has been in the courtroom. Throughout society, antagonists have found rules to keep people using Industrial Age tools.

City by-laws, insurance regulations, labour laws, government lobbys full of lobbyists, the mountains of red-tape; the endless pages of todays rulebook is our society's evil Death Star. Darth Blockbuster uses it to prevent new and better technology reaching the frontline. But before you face Darth Blockbuster and blow up his superweapon, Stargazer, you must learn what weapons you have at your disposal. The most formidable? The all-powerful energy field inside every lifeform. No, not the Force. I'm talking about evolution.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(75.00% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/DeepUnevenGreendarnerdragonfly' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='80%' height='80%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

_I don't want to personify Darth Blockbuster. Here's a clip from the famous BBC show "Yes, Minister", where an idealistic politician deals with a controlling civil servant. This clip showcases how antagonists work. I'm sure you've got you're own examples in your life. Just YouTube, lobbysits, consultants, or corporate meetings if you're lucky enough not to._

## The Magic of Evolution - How Evolution Works

Evolution is life's secret weapon. It empowers life by giving every new lifeform a slightly different variation. With variations, life can continually test for environmental changes in things like water levels, temperature, and food supply. The variations that can't make it die off, and the fittest survive. This natural selection helps life find which lifeforms are best adapted to survive on Earth.

Evolution works so well because it creates biodiversity. Biodiversity means more lifeforms are probing the environment for changes. The more lifeforms feel the pain of environment changes, the sooner life can adapt a solution to the frontline problem.

When biodiversity is high enough, evolution creates an ecosystem. Ecosystems can be described as collaboration. A "circle of life" where many plants, herbivores, carnivores, and decomposers harvest resources together inside a food web. Plants turn light, water, nutrients, into biomass, eaten by the grazer, which feeds the predator. When everything dies, decomposers return everything to the soil, which fertilizes the plants to keep growing. Each lifeform checks another so no one hoards or freeloads. Few lifeforms could exist alone. Most need ecosystems to exist.

Evolution may not be the Force, but it's positively magical. In tune with Nature's own special rhyme and reason, evolution turned a lifeless planet into an oasis of many different ecosystems. The big drawback is time. Biological variations can take millions of years to respond to environmental changes. Think of the poor polar bears. They'll never understand why Arctic ice isn't reforming as massively each year. And even if they could, no lifeform can proactively change their biology.

In contrast, humanity can change—not our biology, but our "cyborgology," if you will (and hopefully in time to help the polar bears). We have the power to feel frontline pain, reflect on the problems causing it, and create a new tool to overcome the problem.

Techvolution is, therefore, intentional evolution. It's a more advanced and quicker form of evolution that isn't a magical mystery, as natural evolution is to polar bears, but is instead something we can understand. The question is, what drives us to evolve when Darth Blockbuster's Death Star often says it's wrong?

## The Majic of Techvolution - How human techvolution works

We call someone a _genius_ when he or she uses existing technology to make a new tool. Happily, these trailblazing protagonsts are self-motivated, and we already celebrate their intellect and innovations. But innovation isn't the only step toward Techvolution. We only truly evolve when regular people choose to use a new tool.

For example, think of computers. Before they could change the world, people needed to use them, which means learning to type. In fact, when stuffy Xerox execs (all males) saw the world's first personal computer in 1977—the Xerox Alto—they refused to use it. The photocopier was the future of office work they said, and besides "typing was women's work". Happily, many Alto engineers fled to Apple and helped make the first MacIntosh. The point is if everyone refused to learn to type, computers would be useless. Society only upgrades when individuals decide to learn how to use a tool and integrate it into their lifestyles.

So, what trick does Nature play on extras to reach for new tools when so often would be risking Darth Blockbuster's, or in this case, Darth Photocopier's, wrath? The answer is a force found within us all.

Unlike evolution, the trick is not actually akin to magic. We, humans, understand we're dropping one tool and familiarizing ourselves with another, like when swapping out the DVD player for Netflix. Yet there's still something wonderfully mystical about choosing to leave one's comfort zone to learn a new cyborgolgy. I call it majic; it's pronounced like magic, but spelled differently to note a critical difference: majic is the free choice of a regular person to proactively and intentionally evolve, even if they don't fully understand how they're upgrading civilization. Majic encompasses our yearning to explore, to learn, to grow, to live to our fullest potential.

Typically, we underappreciate how cool it is to learn new tools. But every time we try, we're like a drowning desert fox wearing fins and goggles, yelling out, "I'm getting better!" as he fulfills his dream of learning to swim. Pushing our boundaries is what life is all about. It's majic that keeps us jumping back into the water and out of our comfort zone.

Techvolution is the ruling philosophy that encourages extras to "majically" bond with any tool they want so they can solve frontline problems as player gods. Yet what do we do when the Death Star says it's wrong?

**Majic**: The natural inclination of a person to learn, use, and hold new tools to increase their natural abilities. Majic inspires people to become player gods who evolve humanity and solve frontline problems. A majician teaches themselves, or other people, new tools.

![old philosophy in a new world](/img\sketches\darwins-finches.jpg)
_Charles Darwin visited the Galapagos islands in 1835. Each island had a different environment. Darwin noticed the same bird was slightly different on each island. He then saw each birds beak was adapted to eat one type of food like bugs, seeds, or nuts. After years of study, Darwin explained the differences using his theory of evolution (1859). Humanity mimics evolution by inventing and using new tools. Since we can drop and pick up tools, we can evolve so much faster than other lifeforms. It's majic that keep us learning new tools._

- Note: Majić is my family name. I lucked out because it reads like "magic" in English. It may seem egotistical to coin "majic" as a term here, but I couldn't think of a better work (I swear). Primarily, the use of "majic" pays tribute to my parents. If you've liked this book so far, you'll know why.

- Sticking it to my personal Darth Blockbuster makes me smile too.

## Using Majic to Filter the Rules - How to tell the good from the bad rules

Despite our problems with our current philosophy, society always needs one philosophy that reigns above the rest. We use it to create the ground rules that glue us all together. Without a ruling philosophy, there would be no player god. The game of civilization would be a story of chaos.

Darth Blockbuster fights to control the ruling philosophy. When he succeeds, he writes rules to keep the tools he commands, and therefore himself, in power. Corporate manuals, university guidelines, social justice blogs are among the pages of his Death Star fighting off the Internet Age. These rules interfere with regular people's majically bonding with new tools. But how can you tell if a rule is good or bad? How can a regular person pinpoint a rulebook as a Death Star? Darth Blockbuster doesn't tell people he's Darth Blockbuster. Instead, he says he's the prince or the executive. Are these people genuine authority figures in society, or Darth Blockbusters protecting their paychecks?

It's essential to filter out the good from the bad rules throughout our everyday lives. It takes practice, and it demands cultivating our integrity and inner truths. Yet it's a struggle that's been taking place for centuries. As an example, you needn't look further than this story of a Maryland farm boy named Frederick, who was born approximately two centuries ago.

===

Our story is about a Maryland farm boy named Frederick using tools to overcome ignorance. His farm is one of those you might have seen on shows like _Little House on the Prairie_. Salt of the earth farmers raising crops and families in 19th century rural America. No internet, no school systems, no much to learn but how to survive with your hands and the fortune God gave you.

Frederick worked the fields with his mother. It was hard labor of course, there weren't many machines around, so he had to work hard, for himself and his mother.

In a few years, Frederick was sent to work with a relative in Baltimore. The house was large, and the young family could use help cleaning, shopping, doing chores. It made his mother happy he wouldn't sweat so much, yet Frederick was a farmer and unsure of the big city.

The patriarch of the house was named Hugh. He wasn't around much. His new wife Sophia was. She was a foreigner used to colder climates who didn't know many people yet, so she stayed in a lot. Sophia was nice and treated Frederick nicely too. Not as a farmer, but as an interesting person. She made Frederick feel at ease.

One day, Sophia handed Frederick a list of items to pick up from the store. Frederick's eyes looked down, his shoulders slouched, like a dog who disappointed its masters. Frederick mumbled, "I can't read."

"My God, well that won't do!" Sophia responded, then continued "Reading is good. How else can a person give and receive information from... from... the world! I'll teach you; we'll do it together." So, Sophia taught Frederick to read. Just a few weeks, and he got the basics. Sophia performed majic and was overjoyed.

Frederick even more so! Finally, all those markings in the store, on street corners, in books, in newspapers, in the Holy Bible, mean something, a new world! Go left, turn right, open, closed, discounted, welcome, and Salvation, all words that open a new world.

Now Frederick danced to the store, he whisked himself to do his chores, because he was learning to read a little more every day. He loved how the world kept getting bigger, and information kept pouring in.

One day Hugh came home early. He saw Sophia and Frederick reading at the dinner table. Hugh walked into the room. "Boy, get out, and wait in the hallway. Face the wall."

Frederick got out, went outside, and faced the wall. Seconds turned to minutes. Frederick rolled the newspaper in his hands tighter. He didn't want to go back to the farm. But even more, he didn't want his angel to get in trouble.

Inside the room, Sophia was curious, "What is it?." Hugh responded "This isn't Ohio... Darling you can't do that. We could get in a lot of trouble. You can't teach them to read."

Sophia responded "everyone learns to read in Ohio."

Hugh takes a seat. "This isn't a free State. He is a slave. What do you think happens when slaves read? Don't you think they'll start thinking?" Sophia's eyes went wide. Hugh continued "It's against the rules to teach a slave to read... now teach the boy."

As Frederick heard the hallway door open, he straightens up, and grips his newspaper.

Sophia says "Turn around."

Frederick does, and looks at his angel, the one who talked with him like he was a person. And she looked back and only saw _her boy_.

Sophia slapped the newspaper from her boy's hand. He didn't let go. She slapped again, and again and again. Each slap hurt more than a dozen whips on his scarred back.

She slapped, and slapped, and slapped, and slapped. Sophia was told her society's philosophy and it clicked for her. Now she knows what evil is and she will not do it. Sophia then and there became a demon protector of vile racism to justify human slavery.

Frederick's world shutdown again. The one white person ignorant enough to treat him like a person, was now an educated convert to the rules that put him into chains. Physical chains if needed, but evil prefers mental chains of ignorance; they stay on so much easier.

Weeks later Frederick was still in despair. His daily routine was the same. Yet, working under demonic masters is just different. He didn't dance to the store, he didn't whisk to do his chores, and he never saw Sophia smile again. Demons are never happy because they're always on guard.

One day while doing his chores, Frederick saw a newspaper, the avenue to knowledge whose path Frederick was once on. He looked at the markings, saw some words he knew, and one word he didn't. Yet he still stared at it. Why?

The answer slapped him harder than the demon ever did, he read the words "The Free States in the North." He heard the word freedom before, but he didn't know freedom was a real place.

A shockwave went through him when he realized if slavery was a place, then so must freedom be a place too. Frederick realized he could break chains! Because ignorance was always his demon, and knowledge was always his angel. And he fought ignorance, and received knowledge, whenever he read.

So, Frederick taught himself to read. He practiced with ignorant white kids on the streets. He practiced reading items at the grocery store. He practiced on every street sign. And he practiced every time he was at the Baltimore dock; the dock I said, you know the place, where ships will take you anywhere in the world. If you can read the schedule.

One day Sophia waited for her boy to return. But the boy died when the man Frederick Douglass walked onto the ship headed north to freedom. The man knew the exact time, place, and fare he needed to get on. He read it, himself, on the schedule. Reading opened the world to Frederick, and now the free world was opened to him.

The story gets better. Frederick Douglass becomes a brilliant orator and writer. In a world with no radio, video, or telephones, he travels the Northern States and Europe telling everyone the truth about slavery. When the American Civil War (1861-1865) broke out, his books helped Britain reject recognizing the South, and thus deprived it of much needed support. The irony of a slave educating people about slavery, and thereby helping to end slavery, is the cherry on top of this great story.

_This is a diagram of the story. A technology comes with a philosophy. And each philosophy has its protagonists. The people are in the middle. If they stay as extras, antagonists win. If we become player gods, protagonists win._

===

Frederick Douglass was a true Jedi Master. His exceptional bravery, persistence, and intelligence helped to showcase humanity's endless potential. He became a player god, who became a protagonist, who convinced extras to upgrade society's ruling philosophy against vile racism. The big lesson we learn Stargazer is how to use majic to tell the difference between good and evil rules.

Sophia taught Douglass to read. She wasn't told to. She did it because we love teaching our chosen tools, whether they're soccer balls, new apps, or how to tape drywall. It's as natural to spread our tools, as it is for a species to propagate.

When a magician makes a playing card disappear, we smile in awe and childish wonder. That's cool, but nothing new was created, so we soon lose our joy. However, when a majician connects someone with typing, programming, or drones, they've similarly performed something awesome. They've upgraded someone's cyborgology and effectively created a new and improved person. This makes us smile for a long time. Creation is an upgrade, upgrades are majic, and majic is Nature's long-lasting dopamine fix to motivate us to keep evolving.

Yet human-made rules _sometimes_ say upgrading to a new tool is wrong. Medieval parishioners couldn't read a science book, French peasant farmers couldn't have a musket, a 1990's kid couldn't download a digital song. Today millions of tired working moms can't telecommute.

Rather... the tired mothers can, they all have high-speed internet and home computers, but they don't. The question is: why not?

There is no easy answer. Remember in no story does anyone ever say they're evil. Society's rulebook will never call itself a Death Star. The lesson Stargazer is it'll never be easy to know the difference between good and bad rules. Anyone can proclaim rules. Even kids on the playground can say "only tall kids can play," and others, based on personality, will obey or rebel.

Majic is thus our best judge of the rules. Majic feels right. It naturally makes us smile. It improves us and our way of life. From teaching a kid to walk to teaching a grandmother to "Skype in" and watch her grandkid's first steps, teaching and learning new tools open our hearts because it turns us into player gods who improve ourselves and our civilization. It's why we build things in civilization computer games; no game is about holding back upgrades.

So, when you're teaching or learning a new tool and someone steps in your way with a rule, ask yourself if you feel wonderfully inspiring majic, and if you do, ask the rule maker why he doesn't. Perhaps there's a good reason. But keep Sophia in mind. Performing majic made her feel good, while following the rules only made her feel safe. The Death Star operates by fear; majic by joy.

Safety is fleeting Stargazer. Human rules are created by hierarchies, which topple with every new technological age. Thus all rulebooks eventually expire. Majic never will. It always was, and always will be, in our souls as we play the game of civilization. Majic is how we naturally test human rulebooks. Electricity, the microchip, the iPhone were all made by people who broke the rules. Yet we celebrate their innovators Nikola Tesla, Robert Noyce, Steve Jobs because they invented new tools that let us feel and spread majic today.

Ignore majic at your peril. Look at Sophia, she gave one of our greatest writers and orators his start. Yet she lived a miserable life watching him achieve greatness because she broke the rules. Unhappiness is the inevitable punishment to everyone who ignores the happy joy of learning or helping others learn new skills and tools.

It's a lesson for us to take in when we're stuck in traffic, getting the gears from eight different bosses, or doing whatever else is giving us such unhappy lives. We're not happy because we're not learning the new skills and tools of the Internet Age. We're not upgrading our civilization. This is why we need Techvolution. A modern philosophy that says holding back majic is wrong.

_The joy of majic. This YouTuber learns new skills then posts videos of his experience. Look how happy he is once he finally does it. We're unhappy today because our workplaces still treat employees like dones in Industrial Age's era of mass-production. In the Internet Age we all should be learning new tools to improve things on the frontline in an era of mass-collaboration. If someone holds back majic at work, it's a good sign they're the ones with the problem._

## Now We Know the Difference Between Good and Bad, It's Time to Use It

Stargazer, you're not Frederick Douglass. You're not enslaved. You're not beaten. You're not being chased. But that doesn't mean we should be happy with our lives any more than Douglass should have been content with his personal freedom. Our society needs player gods to solve today's problems. You have the same job Douglass did. That means you have to follow majic, become a player god, and evolve humanity past Darth Blockbuster and into the Internet Age.

One big problem arises. Sometimes we feel the wrong majic, and therefore don't see, nevermind fight, Darth Blockbuster and his Death Star. Both are concealed when our love of new and interesting technology is co-opted by a very unnnatural, and anti-evolutionary force. One I call dark majic.

## Dark Majic Masks

In Nature there are continual adaptations of existing lifeforms, and then sometimes entirely new lifeforms. In Techvolution, this is the difference between upgraded technology and an entirely new tool.

Upgrading a technology, such as going from sedans to SUVs, VHS to DVD's, tube TV's to LCD's, is a small change. Each product is different technologically, but they do the same job, so there users have the same powers, and are thus the same cyborgs. New technology doesn't start a political battle. The Death Star isn't fired up so to speak.

But when we've upgraded enough technologies, like microchips, touchscreens, batteries, and Wi-Fi, a protagonist can unlock a new tool; like smartphones. New tools solve problems in a new way. And this is a big deal.

![New Tool Creation](/img\diagrams\techvolution-new-tool-creation-pc-s.png)
_New technology is continually invented. When enough separate technology is invented, a new tools is created._

Because new tools prompt a question: who controls it? After all, whoever does is more powerful. While the game of civilization is the struggle to overcome problems by upgrading technology and inventing new tools, politics is about the battle to control them. The people with the old tool fight to retain their power. While the inventors,innovators, and majicians imagine a new society that shares it.

Darth Blockbuster is willing to use society's rulebook to suppress new tools. But lawsuits, firings, lobbying, and other techniques take time and money. It's better for the antagnoists if Main Street's love of majic is misdirected for a love of old technology the antagonists control. For example, muscle cars today trying to keep customers away from Tesla with techniques like mass advertising, fancy auto shows, and spectacular chromes plated V8 power! I call these anti-evolution techniques "dark majic."

In addition to the Death Star of corporate manuals, regulations, government red-tape that drive Main Street bonkers today. Darth Blockbuster also uses dark majic against us. Dark majic is the pomp, pagantry, and spectacle that surrounds today's Industrial Age tools, like insurance ads, car commercials, auto shows, and credit car rewards. This fake majic is a more insidious technique to prevent upgrades. It gives people the joy of learning about technology, but it doesn't upgrade their cyborogolgy, and thus stalls our society in the game of civilization.

**Dark majic**: Methods and techniques to keep a person using an old tool. Dark majic gives regular people a fake sense of joy and accomplisment, so they don't upgrade their cyborgology and become player gods. A dark majician tricks people into being extras.

## Dark Majic by Darth Blockbuster

I've processed about 10,000 car accident insurance claims. Drivers call a call center, adjusters (me) ask them questions to get them back on the road. Adjusters aren't nearly as cheap as most people assume—we usually overspent actually. The job is mostly asking questions nad filling out paperwork. One question showcased how deep our society likes dark majic.

When I'd ask customers their car's color, I'd often hear something like "it's midnight summer blue". I'd play around and ask "you sure it wasn't winter sunrise blue?" The customer would replay "No, it's the midnight summer."

A chuckle would turn into amazement when I'd ask what the other car. I'd almost always be told "I have no idea." It was a pain because my job was to get this information. But even though they'd were just in a car accident together, customers usually didn't remember a thing about the other car. I mean nothing. Not the make, model, color, not even if it was a sedan or SUV. When a driver hit a horse, they'd remember what they hit, but a car? Usually I'd have to input "unknown" and move on.

We think our vehicles are so unique and special. It's not a car, it's "The original Sports Activity Vehicle®: a fearless leader and stylish benchmark. A BMW x5Drive50i, with Phytonic Blue Metallic paint". I'm not kidding. People would talk like that. And not know a thing about the other car.

And that's dark majic. People a person living in 2020, is acting like it's 1969, when cars were new, interesting, and majical. When people cruised the roads, because traffic didn't exist, travelling anywhere on demand was a novelty, and road trips were still a treat. But it's not 1969, you're not in _Grease_, or _American Graffiti_, and you're not James Dean.

_Professional driver on a closed course. And still a gas car, with four wheels, probably stuck in traffic._

The truth is cars are all so similar today, few stand out. Because to civilization in 2020, what makes a car special is it's reliability, how well a mechanic maintains it, how good your dealer treated you. The frills are interesting, enjoyable, but in the end don't really matter. You're the same cyborg with almost any car. Driver's admitted as much, because after an accident, what they wanted most of all was a rental car. Fancy features and made up colors didn't matter; they just needed to get around and get on with their lives. Dark majic makes us think we're participating in the game of civlization as important player gods, but we're really just distracted extras living in the past.

Industrial Age industries use dark majic to keep their customers attached to an aging product. Hollywood is a great example. In the 1930s and 40s, master storytellers like Samual Goldwyn, David O. Selnick, and Irving Thalberg headed studios that used projector, sound, and film technology to make movies a worldwide sensation. Like Steve Jobs created the world of apps that has us fixated on our phones, early Hollywood's studio system created a world of stories that glued people to their theatre seats.

Over the next decades things changed. Television came in 1948, which hurt movie theatres. Worst, was the government (foolishly) made a rule banning studios from owning, or even collaborating with, movie theatres—which broke up the studio system that worked so well. By the 1970s the movie industry was hurting. It was good movies like The Godfather (1972), Jaws (1975), Star Wars (1977) that brought some people back to the theatre.

By this time the movies were no longer run by master storytellers but by businessman obsessed with mass-production. The industry lost it's ability to tell original stories. Instead, they made sequels, remakes, and franchises. Each new release had to use more rauchiness, special effects, and celebrities to attract attention. Movie attendence didn't rise in the 1980s and 90s—jacked up popcorn prices weren't enough to save many theatres chains from going bankrupt—but studios didn't care. They made money outside the theatre.

Because the public rushed to rent VHS tapes from Blockbuster. Even though they sued VCRs, studio's happily used theatres to hype up the growing rental business. When the DVD and flatscreen televisions came (1999), the industry was gleeful. As the public abandoned movie theatres and crazed over home theatres, they bought billions of DVDs and watched their favorite stories at home.

Fundamentally speaking, movie theatres and home theatres, were technologically the same. The customer still needs to drive to a physical product, be it a film reel or DVD. And here was the sweet spot of the Industrial Age powers. The industry could use digital technology to lower the costs of mass-production, while still charging premium prices. Why would movie studios or Blockbuster more convienent distribution, or tell better stories?

No reason except evolution. Because true to form, technology kept getting better, and hi-speed internet (2004) finally came to Main Street. Now the public didn't need to drive a physical product. Now the public could share in the benefits of the Internet Age because home internet streaming was possible. And predictably a new tool asked a huge political question, who controls it?

![Techvolution battle](/img\diagrams\techvolution-battle.png)

I was a theatre usher/projectionist back then and saw it all first hand. Most movies stunk: comedies, tradegies, dramas, suspense, usually fell flat. Theatres were over-priced and often empty. Customers were unhappy. The industry didn't care. They gave themselves lavish paychecks, banquets, and award shows. Any consideration of the upgrading their customers to the Internet Age was non-existant.

So no, the industry wouldn't throw away the DVD. Instead, they doubledowned on it. Twice! They made HD-DVD and Blu-Ray (2006). The increased the dark majic of marketing, DVD packaging, and celebrity featurettes. The heck with internet streaming!

In swoops today's internet Jedi on an ethernet chandlier. Unknown and unpaid technologists created BitTorrent sites, that although filled with computer viruses, bad picture quality, and poorly designed user interfaces, gave regular people movies on the internet. Here, the dark majic of DVDs, faced off against the majic of internet streaming.

A decade before the music industry was in the same spot. Record stores and CD sales died when customers got the internet and flocked to torrent sites like Napster. Music executives tried—and failed miserably—to make their own online music platform. When Steve Jobs made iTunes to help save the music industry, he said he'd "never spent so much of my time trying to convince people [music executives] to do the right thing for themselves". Eventually Jobs got them on board, and the iPod, iTunes, and AppleMusic is of course history.

| Best Picture Winners | Average Theatre Gross  |
|----------------------|------------------------|
| 1990s                | $ 188,752,801          |
| 2000s                | $ 142,705,937          |
| 2010s                | $ 64,035,754           |

_Average gross for each Best Picture winner. As the movies were dying, the industry fought back with excuses and lawsuits, instead of innovation and evolution. People didn't even bother watching Oscar movies on Netflix either. ALl numbers from boxofficemojo.com._

The movie industry rejected the lesson. When DVD dark majic lost out to the majic of streaming, the industry fired up the Death Star. The same public who bought billions of dollars on DVDs and merchanise. That created fan clubs and flocked to comic-cons, was declared evil. The movie industry put FBI warnings on their products, lobbyied government for harsh punishments, and demanded the public feel ashamed for not buying DVDs anymore. Customers were sued, threats of lawsutis were mailed out. The industry called their own customers disloyal thieves.

And here was born Darth Blockbuster. He was actively and knowingly trying to force humanity to keep using his old tools in our cyborgology. Rather than gluing us in our seats with good stories, Hollywood he was gluing DVDs is our hands with the Death Star, and preventing society upgrading to the Internet Age. But before we find if the villian could save the DVD (I know you know the answer, but indulge me), let's take a short break.

![Frontline movies full](/img\sketches\frontline-movies-full.jpg)

_Today, most movies stink, most theatres are dead, most people don't even stream or "steal" movies anymore. They're watching good stories on Netflix. That's you Stargazer, looking at the frontline after removing the dark majic mask that had you watching pompeous banquets giving out awards to movies you've likely not even seen._

# Intermission

Let's consider some things during our short rest.

## Polar Bears in the Amazon

We've been in the Internet Age since 1970. However, we're still using the philosophy of Left/Right politics, and era of mass-production economics, both hallmarks of the Industrial Age. The powers of the Industrial Age. like newspapers, television, call-centres, keep their tools as the levers of power by way of dark majic to distract Main Street, and when that fails, they pick a rule from the Death Star to prevent change.

The Death Star can be seen in the explosion of regulations since 1970. The huge increase in trademarks, copyrights, and patents. And think of this, lobbyists didn't exist in 1969—and now many people think a few thousand of them run our governments.

Antagonists hold back our evolution. The result is an unhappy life on Main Street. Since 1969, road traffic has gotten far worse. Plastic production and pollution is filling up the oceans. Climate change is roasting our planet. Consider that last point; the world's fucking climate is changing, because humanity is not allowed to evolve.

We're basically polar bears in the Amazon. Seriously—think of it, our environment is different, our societies are different, and our cyborgology is different. We are a different people being forced to live as if it were 1969. There's nothing wrong with polar bears, or the Amazon, but neither is adapted for each other. Same goes for a person in 2020, with a Intel i5 laptop, hi-speed internet, VR glasses, who is driving through two hours of traffic, to work at a call-centre.

The Woodstock and _Leave it to Beaver_ America of 1969, is gone. But Darth Blockbuster won't let go. Hopefully Main Street wakes up. Especially in time to save the actual polar bears.

PICTURE

Techvolution is the new philosophy that mimics evolution. It gives gives the right, and the duty, to the people feeling the pain of frontline life to evolve humanity with new and better tools. Crucially, it's the open-source community who lets the public build its own levers of power, so we don't have to wait for persmission to do what's right. Only by embracing Techvolution will our society foster the era of mass-collaboration and catapult us all into the Internet Age. Only a society of players gods can evolve humanity past our problems, and give Main Street a happy life.

_You're happiness is the statistic about our civlization's health. Here are some stats to show our struggle against stagnation._

## Old Philosophy vs. New Philosophy

Techvolution is a philosophy book. I use stories to note their ideas, but don't directly reference past philosophies. Like any topic it takes some practice to read. However, let's have a peek and appreciate the strong beliefs of past protagonists and antagonists.

Below are two snippets from two influential philosophers. The passages will help explain how an antagonist can think themselves so right, when history proves them so wrong. I won't comment much on either passage. Just know both of these writers motivated generations of followers to fight to the death.

===

  >SINCE the time that learning began to flourish there has been a common opinion maintained which affirms: "Mankind is naturally endowed and born with freedom, and at liberty to choose what form of government it please, and that the power which any one man has over others was at first bestowed according to the discretion of the people."

  But how this vulgar opinion has of late obtained a great reputation is unknown to me. It is not to be found in the ancient fathers and doctors of the true Church. It contradicts the doctrine and history of the Holy Scriptures, the practice of all ancient monarchies, and the very principles of the law of nature. It is hard to say whether it is more erroneous in divinity or dangerous in policy.

  This desperate assertion whereby kings are made subject to the judgements and deprivations of their subjects follows as a necessary consequence of foolhardy position of the supposed natural equality and freedom of mankind, and liberty to choose what form of government it please.

Patricia, Or the Natural Power of Kings
by Robert Filmer
1680
(I made some edits for readability's sake)
https://www.constitution.org/eng/patriarcha.htm

===

  >We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. —That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, —That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.

Declaration of Independence
by Thomas Jefferson
July 4, 1776

===

The belief in nobles divine rights wasn't simple selfishness. A lot of smart people wrote philosophy to justify one person having absolute power. The royal rulebook didn't have to call itself a Death Star; it was based on a respected philosophy.

Today, our Death Star rulebook aren't arbitrary rules. They come from Industrial Age philosophy and the era of mass-production. It's important to remember as we push for the Internet Age. The antagonists feel justified using their Death Star. And they'll keep winning, until we believe in a new philosophy.

## The Era of Mass-Collaboration Is Already Here

While the antagonists are fighting it, the Internet Age and its era of mass-collaboration is already here and growing. I included some examples of collaboration projects below. You can contribute to any of them. Not only should you take a minute to try, you should sit back and realize what you're doing. Because with no managers, consultants, and timesheets, you can work will others to advance humanity with nothing but a laptop, the internet, and you.

One day soon, your job will likewise require so little travel, stress, and time. And no, you won't lose your job. It's the head-office types, the HR reps, the eight different bosses, the people with no frontline skills, whose meetings, delays, and arrogance are unneeded in the era of mass-collaboration. That's why the fear the Internet Age so much.

Galaxy Zoo: https://www.zooniverse.org : Help astronomers classify stars and galaxies. You might even be the first to discover something new.

Common Voice: https://voice.mozilla.org/en : Help inventors give their apps voice commands, by donate your voice, anonymously of course. A free and independent voice database lets any company or person improve their software.

Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com : Every programmer, from beginner to expert, have questions only other programmers can answer. Stack Overflow lets them all ask questions, and rewards those who give the best answers. This mass-collaboration will soon connect you, with other people doing your frontline job.

Kickstarter: https://www.kickstarter.com/ : Kickstarter connects regular people trying to solve a problem, with regular people waiting for a solution. A few bucks could fund a product you could need. The software of this website, Ghost Foundation, was started on Kickstarter.

There are many more examples of digital products connecting people on the frontline. The era of mass-collaboration is here. We just aren't jumping into the Internet Age yet. You yourself don't have to solve every problem, but using tools like this, you can be part of the world that starts solving its problems.

Just to drive home the point, what levers of power does Right/Left politics put in your hand? The idea doesn't even exist, because they think its 1969, when the levers of power weren't for Main Street to hold. Neither side can understand the Internet Age and mass-collaboration is the best of both ideologies. Modern technology let's people help their civilization prosper and modern also better themselves, the former is Progressives dream, and the latter is what Conservatives demand. Mixing ideologies is how Techvolution builds on the past, and helps Main Street prosper once again. Now let's see what this means for regular person working on Main Street.

## The Era of Mass-Collaboration Is (Almost) Here in Your Everyday Life

Say you moved into a new townhouse. You and you're new neighbors all want to finish move in, renovate, and finish your backyard. Soon enough, everyone starts installing assembling lawn furniture, hiring contractors, putting in decks, pools, fences, sheds, and whatever else you dream up.

These decisions, are the ones that matter. So, the question is, do we realize that? Do we we consider the big picture, when deciding what to do in the backyard?

If we choose new and better products, we're attracted to the majic of new tools, and become player gods. If we care about trendy looks, brand names, and pretending to live inside Martha Stewart Living, then we're being an extra, attracted by dark majic. Watch this clip of a user building a backyard in the city-builder _Cities: Skylines_.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/ClassicSecretKarakul' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

For us today—doing all this work in the real-world—do the rules encourage us to be player gods? Or is the rulebook so big and confusing, that regular people are encourage to go with the flow, and stay extras of the Industrial Age?

Evolution needs us to buy solar-power roofs, start a 3D printing business in the garage, install a Hydroloop water resuser. These are the tiny levers of power, everyone on Main Street can start to control. But do you now if your home insurance policy covers hail damage to newly installed solar panels? Do you even know where to find out if it does? Do you know what your local business by-laws, construction codes, tax laws are?

Our society's rulebook is so large and dense, we all live under the threat of making a mistake, and being hit by a code violation, claim denial, lawsuit, or audit. Being an extra is easy today; being a player god is risky.

Technologically speaking, there's no reason for this. Regular people can work as easily as the _Cities: Skylines_ clip above. Open-source software, GPS, smartphones, high-speed internet, AES security protocols, cloud computing, YouTube videos. Today we can make the Internet Age rulebook seemless. We can have the levers of power in our hands! But this will only be a happy reality once Main Streets embrace the era of mass-collaboration using Techvolution as their shield and motivation.

_Here's Louis Rossmann again. He's building a new store for his repair company. A complete internet stranger did a better design job than a professional architectural company. Much like Uber, GitHub, and Figma, digital tools like email, YouTube, and Autodesk, make this worker-to-customer, and worker-to-worker collaboration, much easier. Companies wont disappear in the future—we'll always need big organizations. They'll just be checked and balanced by individuals and small companies connected in mass-collaboration. We'll make the Internet Age rulebook a little later, in Techvolution II: Building the Life Star._

## Click

What makes something click in a person's mind? If only we knew. Sadly, we can't decide to cry, scream, or love. We must wait for a connection in a story, or in everyday life. Here's some stand-up that'll probably make you laugh, I'll make a point afterwards.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOiPQ8nqB1s&feature=youtu.be&t=19

Note, followers of the Industrial Age complain because their time period is over, so they can't contribute to society anymore and instead live unfulfilled, unhappy lives, as mere extras.

Here's my point, nobody knows how or why something clicks. However, we do understand when it does—when we can't go back. And could you ever drop Netflix and do back to Blockbuster? What about flipping through encyclopedia books? Or calling a taxi-cab? Of course not, and that's a good sign you're a believer in the Internet Age. So, lets return to the book and our mission, that's about you dropping the addiction to mass-production and phantom chasing of Left/Right politics for Techvolution, a new philosophy that gives Main Street the right and duty to upgrade our civilization to the Internet Age because you, are the true, and rightful, player god. The antagonists are just pretenders.

# Mid Point

## A Techvolution Battle Scene. Wikipedia vs. Books. Internet Age vs. Industrial Age

Before we return to the battle with Darth Blockbuster, let's talk about another battle in support of the Internet Age. The fight against Darth Enclyclopedia.

As people encounter problems, we of course ask questions. Today those might be, why are the movies so expensive, are candy applies real apples, or, more importantly, what are proven techniques to stop malaria infections. Humanity records and find answers by creating a reference tool.

Our first reference tool was the wisdom of our elders. The first technological upgrades were papyrus scrolls and ink (around 2300 BC) and books (about 300 BC), which turned some elders into experts like Hippocrates and Aristotle. When wood-pulp paper (1200) and the printing press (1456) were invented, humanity unleashed mass-produced books. Now experts could share knowledge between themselves and educate the masses. We called the reference books encyclopedias. As Douglass already showed us, knowledge is the greatest lever of power.

That's why encyclopedias were a massive hit; up until a generation ago, many households proudly included a physical encyclopedia collection in their library. _The Encyclopedia Britannica_ (1878) was the standard. In 1933 it started to be re-published every year to keep people updated to the latest facts. When the Internet Age hit in the 1970s, home computers, digital printers, and telecommunications meant encyclopedias were written and stored digitally. But they remained a set of printed books and CD's controlled by experts.

Then came the world wide web (1991), a new technology that brought the internet, and the Internet Age, directly to Main Street. The internet unlocked many new tools like websites, forums, blogs, and something called "wikis." Wiki software lets anyone write or edit a webpage by pressing "edit now." All changes are saved, so anyone can erase errors or vandalism by pressing "undo now." For years programmers used wikis to write technical manuals collaboratively.

As web boomed in the late '90s, protagonist Jimmy Wales wondered if the web could upgrade encyclopedias. Today, most of us curious about things like the movies or malaria know this story ends with a free online encyclopedia anyone can edit called Wikipedia. It became the poster child for the era of mass-collaboration. But it didn't start out that way.

Wikipedia started as Nupedia (2000), a free online copycat of Encyclopedia Britannica. Nupedia followed the Industrial Age rationale of making gates. It said only "expert" professors were qualified to write articles. Wikipedia (2001) was a side project. Only the programmers, designers, innovators of the Internet Age knew mass-collaboration was the way of the future.

Everyone else didn't realize that with a new technological age, comes a modern philosophy as well. The first sign of a problem with Nupedia was that the professors didn't like to share their knowledge. In its first year, Nupedia had 12 articles. Wikipedia had 40,000.

Here rose Wikipedia's antagonists. Professors loved to belittle the public's articles as rubbish. They even used the Death Star and disallowed students from referencing Wikipedia's materials in their school work. Yet professors refused to improve, or to assign students to improve, Wikipedia. The professors also performed dark majic. Despite good referencing abilities, and wide-spread adoption, they still try to convince people to not use Wikipedia.

The second sign of a problem with Nupedia was that it turned out "expert" answers, and "regular" answers are the same. The movies are expensive because of a 1948 "Paramount Decrees" banning studios working with theatres. Candy apples are real apples. And mosquito nets are a simple and effective tool against malaria.

We can all look up these facts because Wikipedia turned so many people into player gods! A massive community voluntarily shared their knowledge one "edit now" at a time and fiercely protected their common knowledge with "undo now." Nobody told them, paid them, or made a rule to force it. Because writing or reading a Wikipedia article, is Nature's majical dopamine rush. Every click being lever of power in Main Street's hands.

Wikipedia now serves billions of searches everyday, while Nupedia and Encyclopedia Britannica are long gone. Even though antagonists tried to stop it, notice how easily digital tools win when the people are free to choose what tools best solve their problem.

That's the story of Wikipedia. Invented by protagonists, established as the standard reference tool by player gods. Few believed it was possible because even professors don't understand new tools always unpower the few, to empower the rest. Interestingly, after I finally conceded temporary defeat to my personal Darth Blockbuster, I uploaded a few pages to Wikipedia instead. Not as helpful as my app, but it took just a few weeks of work, and one "edit now" button, to make it real. It felt majical to bypass the rules of the Death Star. It also put a big smile on my face.

## Death Star Goes Ka Boom

Main Street feels the pain life of real-life. Think about how important pain is in Nature. Does a penquin in a zoo evolve to Antartica's ever changing environment? Of course not, it's up to the lifeforms on the frontline to adapt, and keep the species alive.

The middle-class flocked to Wikipedia and made it a worldwide force. Then we gave internet streaming to our society. We didn't need marches or protests. We only needed to reached for new tools, hold the levers of power, and thereby evolve humanity. We destroy the Death Star when we do what's best for us. And we're right to be so selfish, because we're the ones feeling frontline pain.

Of course, the antagonists will disagree. But that's why they're Sith Lords. The formal education industry has given American students 1.5 trillion in student debt. Hollywood is given billions in subsidies despite having empty theatres, bad movies, off-shored production, and many self-congratulatory and splend banquets and balls; not to mention a culture of tax-cheats and sexual predators.

The middle-class doesn't have ulterior motives. We are rational beings because we feel the pain of everyday life. We rightfully rejected the dark majic of Blu-ray and HD-DVD, and endured the Death Star attacks when using BitTorrent, and worked to evolve humanity. And if you still doubt Main Street being inherently just, once Jedi Reed Hastings gave the public internet streaming at a fair price with Netflix (2008) the middle-class proved the frontline's superior ethics and morality.

Look at the graph below. You'll see the Industrial Age evolving into the Internet Age because Main Street acted on its best interests. This is the power of an empowered middle-class practicing good politics. Evolution is always right in Nature, and Techvolution is always right in the game of civilization.

    </script>

Main Street flocked to Netflix because it was a fair deal and a much better product.

During this transformation, I was one of the smucks working at the movie theate and buying DVDs when I could afford them. Like most of Main Street, I got dozens collecting dust somewhere. Darth Blockbuster was telling us all DVDs were better and moral. I wonder, do you think the Sith Lord will buy them all back? I'll talk half-price.

Notice BitTorents aren't dead. While most people don't bother with torrent sites anymore—because Netflix is so much easier and better—civilization holds torrents in reserve. Torrents check and balance the economy in the Internet Age, to be sure Main Street isn't taken advantage of again. Fairness is the motivation for this insightful GIF.

![Battle Scene](/img\diagrams\checks-and-balances-storytelling.jpg)

If you're wondering, streaming companies are returning the studio system to Hollywood, except the home theatre is replacing the movie theatre. The problem is storytelling is getting segmented, making it harder for our society to have impactful trends like _Uncle Tom's Cabin_, or _Forgotten Spring_. The Studio System should never have been outlawed in the first place. But that's a topic for a different book.

Wikipedia and Netflix show how the middle-class can ignore dark majic, defeat Darth Blockbuster, and destroy his Death Star. We ignored bad rules, and instead used the better tool—which soon became the new standard. While we don't have all the levers of power, we have a lot more then we did just a few years ago. But these are small victories. To bring on the era of mass-collaboration in the Internet Age, we need to transform our society's entire rulebook. And that takes a bit more work.

## We've Blown Up One Death Star, Now Here's How We Win the War

So Stargazer, that's how we won a few battles in the fight for the Internet Age. It's a battle that made me, and everyone else who write and read Wikipedia and watch Netflix, happy. Because evolving humanity puts smiles on our faces.

Imagine how happy Main Street will be when we use digital tools and mass-collaboration to solve our agonizing commutes, confusing insurance contracts, and rising global temperatures. That's the war you must jump into with lightsabers a-blazin', dicing up old evil tools, to supercharge humanity into the Internet Age.

Note, our lives cut across thousands to millions of problems. Thus, our villains are not in a massive group like "the rich" or the "the unions" as old philosophies label. Our villains reveal themselves inside thousands of companies, institutions, and organizations of the Industrial Age who fight to keep their version of the Encyclopedia Britannica or DVD alive.

This is the entire class of middle-men, consultants, managers, and executives who don't know the skills of their industry like nursing, teaching, and (definitely not) cleaning. Their power comes from managing the gates of an Industrial Age technology, and to keep us competing inside their corporate or bureaucratic heirarchy.

Together, protagonists and extras can overcome these antagonists to bring on the Internet Age. I know this is possible because history has proven it. Our struggle to upgrade civilization was fought generations ago with Darth Blockbuster's master: Darth King.

Darth King ruled atop a huge hierarchy. He lived inside gates palaces, using society's money to host splendid banquets and balls. His absolute power was hidden inside the Medieval Age's ruling philosophy of the "noble's divine right to rule." The noble Death Star was so powerful, it had the power of life and death over Main Street, and all the levers of power in one man's hands.

Slowly, as protagonists invented scientific instruments, books, and guns, the Age of Enlightenment was born. With it came values of science, equality, and democracy that turned the people into player gods in the American and French Revolutions. These revolutionaries were inspired by the new philosophy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

## Freeing Cinderella

"Player gods are born free, and everywhere they are tricked into being extras." Rousseau said that in 1762. Actually, he didn't. He said "people are born free and everywhere they are in chains." But the idea is the same. Rousseau was the son of a Swiss watchmaker who grew up to be an eccentric writer. Despite being famous (or infamous), he often had to copy sheets of music to make his rent. More than 300 years later, he is recognized as being a great philosopher, a political visionary, and a protagonist who helped free the world with his new philosophy.

Rousseau lived when kings and queens, dukes and duchesses ruled civilization. A time when Mozart played inside exquisite palaces during the nobility's many banquets and balls. This was the opulence Cinderella dreamed about about while cleaning a chateau. Sadly, unlike the fairy tale, the people didn't have a Fairy Godmother to make their dreams come true. Instead, the commoners cleaned the nobles' vast libraries, used guns while dying in their wars, and were told to ignore what scientific instruments revealed. As extras in the story of civilization, they were distracted from the power of new tools by dark majic—the people believed their beloved Holy Bible said only Darth King had the right to rule.

Rousseau called bullshit. In truth, Jesus was a carpenter, a commoner just like any other person. So, why can't everyone live up to their potential and become player gods? Rousseau made people understand that books, guns, and scientific instruments should liberate the extras who were only in chains for the happiness of con artists. The self-proclaimed "divine nobility" didn't like hearing that. They declared Rousseau a banquet-pooper, a rule breaker, and chased him out of Switzerland, France, and England. Maybe that's why Rousseau rented instead of owned.

It didn't matter. The nobility was in the dying days of their Medieval Age ruling philosophy. Starting in 1776, within Rousseau's lifetime, Darth King started to face the music when the American people started a revolution. One year after Rousseau died, the French had their own revolution in 1789. And on it went from country to country because Rousseau, and others like him, made extras realize they should become player gods in a country "of the people, for the people, by the people." Cinderella soon forgot about the fancy ball, and instead sung the music of freedom in a choir of equals, that sounded something like this:

_Extras singing about becoming player gods. Notice them holding that lever of power called a musket._

Revolutionary songs like this spread the people's liberty, equality, and fraternity throughout the world. In a few years, the Medieval Age was finally gone. The royal Death Star was destroyed. Church and state were separate. Government had checks and balances. Civilization embraced a new ruling philosophy of Democracy. Main Street put presidents and senators, judges, and sheriffs in power, who ruled at the request of the people. The people formed rotary clubs, quilting societies, and other civil organizations that let them run society as player gods.

Rousseau died never having found a home. After they won their revolutions, the people put him to rest inside the glorious Panthéon. He was heralded as a renowned breaker of chains, destroyer of corrupted rulebooks, with his new philosophy that said any guy can be the prince, and any girl can be Cinderella.

The question for us is, how did Rousseau help an entire people embrace a new age, become player gods, and change their ruling philosophy? I'd especially like to know how we do it better because I'd really like to skip horrible wars and revolutions as we venture into the Internet Age.

## Society’s Three Stories Tell Us If We're Watching the Story of Civilization, or Playing the Game of Civilization

Entering a new age doesn't require war. Unfortunately, conflict usually tears down the old age and rings in the new. To avoid it while entering the Internet Age, we have to see our society better than Rousseau did. We can do that because we can learn from him.

Rousseau's words echo this sentiment: let society enter into the Age of Enlightenment. Let the people prosper as player gods who use modern tools to improve their work and home lives. Let the nobility return to natural equality. Let anyone lead society—if they can solve problems and thereby earn the public's approval and consent. Rousseau never said there shouldn't be leaders. He said leaders should deserve their spot in charge of the player gods general will.

He didn't phrase it like this, of course, but that's what Rousseau basically said. He understaood every new age needs a new philosophy that unites the people into thinking of the big picture and making a new player god. Rousseau used stories to show us how humanity transitions from being antagonists and extras of an old age, into being protagonists and player gods of a new one. It shouldn't come as a big surprise that the troublemaking philosopher was also a novelist.

Thus, Rousseau understood stories—fictional and real-world ones—best explained the fabrication and inner workings of any society. He understood, too, that there are good and bad stories. And that each stems from a storyteller who has a very particular purpose.

So let's explain stories. Every story contains a plot: a sequence of events where a protagonist fights an antagonist to overcome a problem. The fight to change reality happens in three parts. The first is the introduction of the problem and the characters. The second is the protagonist and antagonist thinking up plans, and attacking each other. The third part is the conclusion, where we find out which side wins. Although it's easier to see in some more than in others, all stories have this structure.

The difference between good and bad stories is how much it mixes things up to keep you guessing what's going to happen next. While some bad stories are non-stop action scenes or non-stop talking scenes, good stories mix the two up to tell a coherent and surprising story. Here are the three different kinds of stories. Note, I'm using movies because they're more popular then novels or plays.

===

**Classic movies**: are good stories about real-life problems. A protagonist leaves their typical day, builds up courage, and rises to the occasion to overcome a newfound problem on behalf of humanity. Antagonists, of course, fight to keep the status quo the same.

In a classic story, the protagonist and antagonist repeatedly think of new ideas and act on them. Usually, both characters fight to create or control powerful tools like magic books or big bombs.

Mixing logical problem solving, with new ideas, gives classic stories plot twists that keep audiences glued to their seats. Since no one knows if the good or bad guys will win, good stories have a thick plot; people happily watch classic stories precisely _because_ they don't know what's going to happen next.

There's no way to know which stories will resonate with audiences. Still, only classic stories can resonate with audiences and become archetypes like _Cinderella_, _Romeo and Juliette_, _The Matrix_, and _Star Wars_. Real-life people find it easy to relate to these stories because they're very human tales of "Rags to Riches" or "Forbidden Love". That's why archetypal stories exist in all cultures and religions.

![Classic story](/img\diagrams\romeo-juliet.jpg)
_Good stories will always be told._

**Art films**: are not about any specific problem. The main character doesn't challenge themselves or rise to the occasion. They think they have all the answers and don't need to test them out. The art story is about not overcoming obstacles of being lonely, or hating one's job. The main character is thus selfish, self-important; a con-artist. Not because they do not take on a problem, but because they want to be the protagonist even though they aren't leading the way for others to follow.

The result is stories with no storyline and no antagonist. Instead, art stories showcase the main characters' idiosyncratic behavior. Art stories are surprising to the point of being weird, with a conclusion that doesn't improve reality because the main character didn't even try to.

Without logical surprises, art films need to get weirder and more self-obessesd to maintain interest. To insulate themselves from criticism, art filmmakers usually give themselves awards, grandeur, and titles. They dream of being like their main characters—on stages talking about themselves in a bout of self-gratification. Film festivals like Cannes, Sundance, Toronto mainly show art films.

_Watch the entire thing if you can. Ricky Gervais is yelling at a heirarchy, who are so distanced from the frontline, they've lost touch. They virtue signal, as Christian nobility once did, to make themselves feel better._

**Spectacle movies**:- is about an obvious problem, i.e., Godzilla is here, so run like hell and keep running until the movie is over. Spectacle movies are straightforward because the problem is straightforward; survive or die. However, since the action is so instinctual, there's no time for the protagonist to think of new ideas. The result is logical but unsurprising stories.

Spectacle movies reuse old stories and characters. They usually start off as good stories, but as they ramp up special effects, gore, and raunchiness to try and keep their audiences interested, they lose quality. So spectacle producers look for new customers with hype-filled, dark majic using, mass marketing campaigns. Most franchise movies, sequels, and remakes are spectacle movies.

===

These are the three-story categories. In a nutshell, classic stories tackle real-life problems. Art stories are self-obsessed. Spectacle stories are a distraction. This is why art/spectacle stories don't have "spoilers", while we want to "go in fresh" for classic stories.

Society transitions from classic, to art/spectacle inside ages. You can see the transition most easily in your favorite sitcom, such as _The Office, Seinfeld, Friends, HIMYM, The Big Bang Theory_. They start off as classic stories, with characters who deal with relatable problems like not liking their jobs or being tired of dating. We see ourselves in these characters, so we cry, laugh, and all that because we know it could also happen to us too—we're living the same life on Main Street.

However, in later seasons, to keep their now popular characters alive, the sitcom characters stop evolving. Kramer can never get a job, Raj can't get a girl, Dwight can't get self-aware. Here sitcoms become art and spectacle stories. Art, because the main characters don't overcome problems anymore. And, spectacle, because we the audience keep watching our favorite actors, characters, sets, catch-phrases, instead of wanting a new story. The turning point between classic story and art/spectacle story is often called "jumping the shark".

Rousseau explained how society has these classic, art, and spectacle stories, and that our communities travel through them as we develop through technological ages. When we start a new age, it's like watching the first years of the sitcom; everyone is solving everyday problems, and the main characters have earned their spot. At the end of the age, the leaders are self-important, and the people are loyal out of habit. In short, Rousseau noticed how one story works to advance and help society, and the other two work to enrich the artists and distract the masses. And that's where we are today. At that's the problem Techvolution is going to solve.

## Leaving the Spectacle of the Industrial Age Story

We're already technically in the Internet Age. A quite glance at your smartphone shows that. Our society is in trouble because we're stuck inside the outdated Right/Left, mass-production, philosophy of the Industrial Age. Antagonists don't care, because they're happy inside their stories of self-importance. Main Street doesn't notice because they live inside a story full of spectacle and habit.

Spectacle runs on dark majic. It's really hard to see through. Is the Super Bowl really a national holiday? Are luxurious cars worthy of praise? Is have a Bachelors of Arts worth tens of thousands of dollars and four years of life? By questioning our society, our entire way of life is questioned. The best example of how to do this, is the movie The Matrix.

The Matrix shows a dystopian future in which most of humanity is unknowingly trapped inside a simulated 1990's reality called the Matrix. The dream world is created by machines to distract humans while using their bodies as an energy source. The story's hero is Neo. A regular person who asks "what is the Matrix?". His willingness to question reality, eventually gets him recruited by the few untapped humans rebel against the machines.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(41.60% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/ImpossibleOpenHoverfly' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://gfycat.com/discover/matrix-gifs">from Matrix GIFs</a> 

The rebel Morpheus teachs Neo what the Matrix is. A world of dark majic, to distract the masses from their slavery. Neo at first freaks out. How can the entire world be fake? Soon, Neo realizes the truth, and wants the masses to realize it as well. He believes when they do, they can remove the plug, and re-learn the joy of being player gods in control of their own lives. The machines antagonist, Agent Smith, chases Neo. This Sith Lord wants to keep people extras, who keep watching the Matrix and feeding it with power.

Agent Smith can control much of the Matrix, but not all of it. Enforcing the rules of the ruling philosophy of slavery, makes "the agents" bound to its rules too. Neo has a new ruling philosophy of freedom. Thus, he isn't bound by the Matrix's rulebook, a freedom he uses to liberate his oppressed humans.

Neo is a lesson in majic. Because he's not tricked by the Matrix, he can learn any skill he wants. Neo majically jumps higher, fights better, shoots straighter, and soon dodges bullets. The machines, unable to match his skills, fight back with more dark majic.

They get one of the freed humans to turn on Neo and his supporters. Not with the allure of power, but with the lure of going back into the comfortable fake world. The familiar spectacle of Rolling Stone concerts, television sitcoms, and V8 engines is all this modern Judas wants. The traitor knows its fake, but will accept it because "ignorance is bliss."

The traitor losses. Neo is too powerful. In the final battle with Agent Smith, Neo can not only dodge bullets but he can stop them in mid-air. Even better, Neo can see the Matrix's computer code, it's rulebook, and can thus rewrite the rules as he wants. Neo soon kills Agent Smith. At the end of the story, Neo calls the machines leaders, and tells the antagonists:

  >I know you're out there. I can feel you now. I know you're afraid. You're afraid of us. You're afraid of change. I don't know the future. I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how this is going to begin. I'm going to hang up this phone. And then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world without you. A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries A world where anything is possible. Where we go from there, is a choice I leave to you.

Neo shows the people the Matrix is a lie. A dark majic show to distract the people from the true political power, which is to be player gods weldingh the tools of protagonists, to live happier lives on the frontline. The Matrix is a lesson in liberation. Just as Rousseau was.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(41.67% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/OblongGrimyHalibut' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://gfycat.com/discover/fight-gifs">from Fight GIFs</a> <a href="https://gfycat.com/oblonggrimyhalibut-the-Matrix">via Gfycat</a></p>

_Neo learned so much, he sees through the rulebook, and so can easily defeat Agent Smith._

## Lessons From The Matrix

The Matrix is a classic story. Among its lessons is showcasing how good leaders come and go. Neo was the hero chosen from the masses. Once Neo freed the people, he and his friends return to being equal members of the community. Neo's hierarchy of support was temporary, being based on solving a frontline problem. Perhaps he'll be the hero of the next story, but maybe not. It depends on the problem and who the people decide their hero should be.

Neither art or spectacle stories solve frontline problems. Thus, their hierarchies can go on for as long as their storytellers can convince people to watch them, or live inside them. These storytellers, who are the leaders, are self-important. The masses are just like the people stuck inside the Matrix. Distracted from the truth with a dark majic show.

The longer the spectacle lasts, the longer the self-important artists, like Darth King, and Darth Blockbuster, can go on living inside self-obsessed stories. They're happy with the way things are. They want to be heroes atop the hierarchy forever. The longer the story goes, the more pretentious they get.

But like an aging sitcom, it never lasts. Eventually, the people's problems pile up, and they soon need a true hero again. That means a hero who can see through the spectacle of the ruling philosophy, and lead the people to become player gods in a new society ruled by a new philosophy that helps Main Street live happy lives.

The lesson is Stargazer your happiness is the best indicator of which story you're currently in. That's why how much money you have, your job title, the university you graduated from, all this is not the definition of happiness. Happiness only happens when a ruling philosophy helps people contribute to a classic story that helps humanity evolve life on Earth.

So to defeat Darth Blockuser, we can use our understanding of classic and spectacle/art stories to judge our society. Only when a new philosophy clicks, will we disregard his dark majic and fight off his Death Star; and thereby usher in the Internet Age. But hold off, it's better to judge our society after reading about its history. Frederick Douglass broke from the Matrix, Mister Auld was its Agent, while Sophia Auld choose the wrong side.

**Good ruling philosophy**: Embraces the modern technological age. Empowers the people with advanced tools so they can be player gods who solve problems on the frontline. Civilization is lead by individuals who rise to the occasion to become protagonists. Once their specific problem is over, leaders willfully return to being an equal member of the community.

**Bad ruling philosophy**: Meant to stop humanity progressing to a new age. Led by leaders who don't want to empower the people with modern tools or ever return to equality. Instead, the leaders distract the masses from their self-serving leadership, with spectacle.

## Protagonist Kings

Not all kings are con artists. There's a good reason we tell ourselves stories of gallant knights and dreamy princesses. At first, the Medieval Age was led by heroes of a classic tale. These kings and their nobles defeated monsters to create a peaceful country for the people to live in.

In Rousseau's time, noble families ruled every European country. They were in power because of their ancestors. After western Rome fell in 476, western Europe entered the Early Medieval Ages (500-1000). Often called the Dark Ages because there few books, ink, or even literate people to write anything down. In fact, maintaining the existing infrastructure like sanitation, roads, and farmswas hard enough. Advanced civilization was gone. Anarchy ruled.

People like Clovis I, Charles Martel, and Alfred the Great took charge. They were master warriors who used swords, bows, armor, and cavalry to expand their kingdoms, keep away vandals, and fight off invadering Vikings. Even better, they headed large families who kept some peace. The best thing they did was to build castles to protect the newly remade cities, markets, and hospitals.

The Early Medieval Ages was a classic story because heroes saw real-life problems. They rose to the occasion, rallied supporters, and fought the evil villains with swords, lances, and castle walls. Fittingly, a hierarchy formed around these tools. We call it feudalism. You've probably seen it in shows like Robin Hood, Vikings, or Game of Thrones. Feudalism was a rigid hierarchy of kings, bishops, dukes, sheriffs, knights, priests, tradesman, and peasants. In return for loyalty, the people at the bottom got what was called the "King's Peace." Peace started to return civilization, which made new and better shovels, oxen, thatched houses, buckets, sickles, and other tools for the people to expand their cyborgolgy.

The people happily declared the leaders holy because the country's stability was vested into the heroes' own person. The first kings were basically like mafia bosses. These kings didn't rule inside an official parliament or bureaucracy. Like an Odysseus, Robin Hood, or Neo, they themselves were society's protagonists, making them Protagonist Kings. This was the start of the "noble divine right to rule."

To have political power, the kings needed to create it. Since society had no political institutions like dependable judicial systems, standing police force, or governmental departments, the increasing personal rule of the nobility was holy. If they disappeared, so did the re-growing civilization keeping millions of peasants safe. And while it will be hard for us to appreciate, going to church, and believing the holiness of kings, made hard-working peasants player gods thinking of the big-picture. Their subservience rebuilt society with every new thatched home, cabage patch, and newly dug well. And the kings weren't bad guys. They had many battle scars to prove it.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/WarmJubilantIrrawaddydolphin' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

_You'd believe in holy kings too, if barbarians, Vandals, or Vikings were at your doorstep._

Under the rule of Protagonist Kings, Western Civilization rebuilt political institutions like court systems, town councils, sanitation departments. But it was slow going. By the time Western Europe had a fully functioning civilization again at the Renaissance (1400-1600), nobody could remember why the story of divine nobility had started. Who could blame them, the story was already a 1000 years old. Do you remember what happened 1000 years ago?

As Europe went through the Renaissance, the Age of Science, the Age of Enlightenment, the invaders were increasingly gone, fresh water was available, the roads were clean, the markets were busy. The once Protagoinst Kings, were now merely executives of extensive and bureaucratic governments. The only thing that didn't change was the culture of royalty. The leaders had the title of king but were no longer protagonists. They became villains protecting their privilege, who refused to let society grow out of the "nobles divine right to rule", and thus became Antagonist Kings.

## Antagonist Kings

When Western Rome fell, the story of civilization went back to near zero. Picture Syria today, and you'll get an idea of the mayhem. Protagonist Kings had a job—grow a new country as fast as possible. Viking raids, Arab invasions, civil wars, famines, the Black Death were all huge setbacks. But over the next 1000 years, Protagonist Kings and the feudal system they headed, rebuilt civilization.

By the time Europe entered the Renaissance, the system had done its job. The nobles were no longer protagonists, but merely average people who happened to be born with "noble blood." For the most part, they only waged war against each other, and usually only for personal glory. Otherwise, they sat atop a hierarchy who paid no taxes, did not work, and answered to no one. These antagonist nobles used relative peace and prosperity to replace armor with dresses, churches with cathedrals, castles with palaces, and battlefields with banquets and balls.

Loving life, and without opposition, these nobles conned the people, and themselves, with art and spectacle. They lived inside a self-important art culture, where increasing weird behavior, childish gossip, and useless titles, was the norm. And they distracted the people with spectacle. Brilliant cathedrals, royal palaces, and meaningless wars against other kingdoms kept the masses occupied. Like franchise movies, all these spectacles got more intense to keep the story interesting.

Visit European castles and extravagant palaces, modest churches, and brilliant cathedrals, and you'll see the transformation civilization had from classic stories to spectacle in Europe's buildings. Compare the clothes of armored clad Charles Martel, and the dress-wearing Louis XIV, and you'll see the transformation from heroic protagonist to self-important Antagonist Kings. They took credit for the accomplishments of civilization, as though they, themselves, were the player god responsible for it all.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/LavishIncomparableBumblebee' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

_Louis XIV (1643-1715) spent an estimated 50% of France's annual Gross National Product to build and maintain his Palace at Versailles, he didn't even pay taxes. He was a self-described god on earth. The people could even buy tickets to tour the palace. It wasn't long before the country "heard the people sing" as the people became player gods._

During this transformation, frontline problems piled up for the people. Their situation barely changed, and arguably got worse from 1000 to 1778. Their houses were still thatched. They did manual labor all day. They still paid almost all the taxes but were banned from advancing in official society. Feudalism became a caste system controlled by con artists. They fought against distributing the benefits of an advancing civilization to the people doing the work on the frontline. We rightfully call Antagonist Kings Darth King.

When the people were under the Protagonist Kings they tended the fields, make the barrels, and fought the barbarians, they were being player gods. They were helping their civilization prosper. With each new era, came more powerful tools. Along the way of progress, society's ruling philosophy of "nobles divine right to rule" flipped from being a classic story to an art and spectacle one. The practical reason for noble divinity, fighting off anarchy, was ignored. The nobles lost the plot of their own stories. They turned their people from player gods into extras. It sent Darth King's civilizations into revolutions, and cost him his head.

## Repeat Story

I'm not sure if you know this Stargazer, but the Devil was once an angel. I'm serious. The angel Lucifer was his name. He lived with God up in the clouds with the rest of the heavenly beings. All these angles communicated God's will to his people below; teaching them the virtue, morality, and ethics they'd need to become protagonists and player gods.

But Lucifer rejected God's teachings. He grew vain, greedy, and deceptive. Soon he even challenged God's supremacy. God threw Lucifer down from Heaven to be the Dark Lord of hell.

Free from the restrictions of justice, fairness, and good, Lucifer grew his evil powers. Soon he was the Devil, who taught humanity vanity, greed, hubris, selfishness they'd need to become antagonists and extras. But Lucifer kept is angelic form. The Devil can thus be anyone, at any time. Humanity is a mixture of angels and demons. All humanity is has the grace of God, and the greed to think we can be divine.

The trick for humanity is to resist our demons and embrace our angels. To not make "deals with the Devil" so to speak. That's how we can be player gods who do what's best for ourselves, and help society prosper.

Angels and demons is the Christian tale of good and evil. I'm sure many religions share a similar story. The story of Lucifer echoes throughout literature. Harry Potter's Lord Voldermort, The Lord of the Rings Lord Sauron, and Star War's Lord Vader were all once heroes. Each grew evil because they were unwilling to give up their power. They were corrupted by ambitions of lifelong supremacy. It's probably so prevalent in our religions and literature because it's so common in humanity; power often corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.

Likewise, Darth King wasn't an evil person. The transition from Protagonist to Antagonist Kings took hundreds of years. It's easy now to look back and see it all. But one person, like Louis XIV, didn't have the benefit of hindsight. Louis didn't grow up on a farm, and in his 20's convince people he was their king. From childhood he was treated, told, and expected to be God on Earth. So he went with it.

Darth King actually thought he was an angel. During the Age of Enlightenment, philosophers like Voltaire, Hume, and Rousseau were writing about improving humanity with ideals of freedom and compassion. The nobility read these ideals and liked them. After all, these leaders believed they were protectors of their flock. Absolute monarchs with the power of life and death over their subjects, such as Frederick I, Emperor Joseph II, and Catherine II, called themselves "enlighten monarchs." Their mentality was, "Everything for the people, nothing by the people."

We can see how self-serving this mentality is. Why couldn't the nobles pay taxes? Why couldn't the people have a fair judicial system? Enlightened monarchs preached one thing, and did another. The point is Darth King wasn't evil for being born into nobility. He is evil for holding his people back. He wanted them to be extras watching the story of civilization, and not player gods playing the game of civilization. The nobles thus became fallen heroes. And sadly, this story of fallen kings is repeating itself in our modern times as well. Our antagonists are also fallen heroes.

It's important to note, while Rousseau's followers in so many revolutions may have been political free, they were economically desperate. Hunger, disease, unemployment, illiteracy, were all rampant. Rousseau's time was basically one of "economic anarchy." This is when red/blue philosophies, bent on political liberation from kings, and economic growth to conquer poverty, were born.

_Here's a tidbit of an Industrial Revolution business magnate George Westinghouse. Among his inventions was the air brake, fridge, and electric generator. Westinghouse's massive company helped conquer economic anarchy._

Society loved the original kings for winning the "King's Peace". Likewise, the initial economic kings were heroes of the era of mass production who won the "Executive's Prosperity." These heroes said follow me, recognize my property rights, work for my company. The people did. Society got new tools like lightbulbs, stoves, and telephones.

The original leaders of the Industrial Age told a good story, and thus the people were again player gods. Protagonists like Andrew Carnegie, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Louis B. Mayer, are basically the economical versions of original warrior kings like Clovis I, Charles Martel, and Charlemagne.

>When we hit the Internet Age, Protagonist Executives, become antagonist Darth Blockbusters. Another story of a fallen angel.

That should both worry you and make you happy, Stargazer. First the worrying part; Darth Blockbuster defends the Industrial Age because he makes him powerful. He surrounds himself with a story of self-importance and distracts the people with the dark majic of spectacle. Actor John Wayne noticed this started, not surprisingly, in the 1970s for movies:

>Now the goddamned stock manipulators have taken over. They don't know a goddamned thing about making movies. They make something dirty, and it makes money, and they say, 'Jesus, let's make one a little dirtier, maybe it'll make more money.' And now even the bankers are getting their noses into it.

Since, entering the Internet Age, dark majic has skyrocketed. The once humble American Dream to own a home and make a honest living, became a lifestyle of spectacle. Small homes became McMansions with luxury baths and kitches. Cars got bigger, with more chrome, more horsepower. Televisions increased in size to ludicrious proportions. Food got supersized. Sugar was added to everything we eat. Instead of using digital technology to improve life on Earth, technology was used to make a matrix of dark majic that survived by increasing diabetes, laziness, and greed. All because Darth Oil, Telephone, Suburbs, Sugar needed to distract the people from making a new player god to upgrade, and enjoy the freedom, self-sufficiency, and collaboration of the Internet Age.

The good news is, where not at a "let's burn down society" point yet. We can transition to the Internet Age ourselves before the frontline gets so bad and so ununhappy we stat a revolution. We can usher in the era of mass-collaboration ourselves.

_This is a clip from The Big Short. About the Financial Crisis in 2008. This guy is our modern day Antagonist Executive. You're not supposed to understand the economic rationale of CDOs that makes him super wealthy, because there is none. Like the divine rights of nobility, it's just the justification of a self-important hero. By the way, it's not a coincidence Louis palace, and our houses, caused so much economic problems at the end of an age. The 2008 economic risis was always going to happen. A world of dark majic spectacle, like McMansions, only lasts so long. 2008 was nothing. Life on Main Street will only get worse, until we upgrade to the Internet Age via Techvolution._

# ACT THREE

## Evolution Doesn't Happen Without Fighting - Main street Has to Act

Do you believe in Techvolution? Do you think red/blue philosophy old and played out? Do you want to hold levers of power in our society. Do you think we can live happy lives inside the era of mass-collaboration if we leap into the Internet Age? Do you see through the endless rules of the Industrial Age as being bullshit. Like Neo in the Matrix, do you see that these rules are designed to keep the past alive for the benefit of a few antagonists?

You are the hero of civilization Stargazer. These are the questions history is asking you. To help you answer them, here are two stories—one about an antagonist, the other a protagonist. The first is about King Charles I, who ruled England from 1625-1649. Remember the Thirty Years War, when Main Street was tearing itself apart in the name of Protestant and Catholic kings; adding to that anarchy was King Charles. He led England into a civil war to defend his self-image of being god on Earth. His story teaches us about ours, and should help you answer the questions history is asking you to decide.

## Darth King Charles

Charles was a Protestant King. His father King James is famous for commissioning the "King James Version" The Holy Bible. Charles ruled England using the same "nobles right to rule" ruling philosophy as other monarchs of his day. England had a Parliament, but it was only supposed to advise the king and not tell him what to do. However, after some revolts in the Middle Ages, the English parliament uniquely did have the power to approve new taxes.

England was broke in 1610. Like most kings, Charles and his father spent quite lavishly. Now Charles needed to raise taxes. The people and their parliament refused to say yes until they got more political powers. Charles refused to talk to them. Instead, he sent parliament home and ruled by himself for 10 years. The king got his money by using ancient feudal rules. One example, he fined men who didn't come to his coronation years before.

Parliament eventually got sick of this subversion, raised an army, and fought the English Civil War (1642–1646). The parliamentary army was local men devoted to democracy; and on their way to becoming player gods, who chose their officers by merit. Charles's men were mostly nobles who hired mercenaries to fight for them. The war between Parliamentarians and Loyalists gave both sides a life that was "nasty, brutish, and short" as one observer said.

After four years of battles and bloodshed, Charles lost. He was held under arrest, while rules for a less powerful "constitutional monarchy" were being made by the Parliamentarians. Charles then escaped, hired a new army, and fought the Second English Civil War (1648–1649).

Charles lost again. The victorious Parliamentarians were now enraged. They forgot about making constitutional monarchy, and instead charged Charles for crimes against the English people. The new player gods were very pissed off. Charles didn't budge. The Bible said he was God's representative on Earth. He was the natural leader the same way a father is the leader of his children. Charles refused to speak the court; a father doesn't answer to his children.

But then Darth King Charles did speak, and that fact should turn you into a player god today.

## Charles Speaks - The Proof is in the Words

Charles had a speech impediment. Often called a stammer or stutter. No one then, or even now, understands what causes it. For a stutterer, talking is like playing guitar with music notes written by a gremlin. Some words are easy to say, some are ~~difficult~~ hard, and some decide which at the last mili-mili-mili-second.

But a stutter isn't just about pauses, repetitions, or missing words in a sentence. Stuttering is like having a mini-seizure. Your body flexes. Your neck tenses. You stop breathing. It's horrible. I should know because I suffer from the same affliction as Charles did.

The physical pain isn't even the worst. Getting _that_ look from people is. The "what the fuck is wrong with you?" look.

_"Hello, my ~~name~~ I'm Charles. I wa-want can want to ~~help~~ discuss, the situation with the, ~~Parliament~~ House of Parliament or Commons..."_

The prospect of talking, except to yourself and a dog—which Charles had two of—causes huge anxiety. Living a life wondering about all the words you ~~didn't~~ couldn't say, causes loneliness and depression. The movie The King's Speech showed it well. Stuttering usually forces a person to be shy, passive, eager to please, and come up with weird reasons for their erratic speaking like hand gestures, random silence, binge drinking, and swear words (which, like talking to yourself, speaking in an accent, or dogs, for some reason never cause a stutter). It's entirely possible Charles' relationship with Parliament was so bad because he simply didn't want to talk with them. Not that he would ever admit he had an impediment. After all, he was a king!

My speech impediment was the reason I got a job in a car insurance claim department. After a vice president at an old company secretly told my supervisor I wasn't allowed to talk to customers—for fear of embarrassing the company—I was like shit I guess I don't have this damn gremlin under control. I wasn't even that mad about it (although I was that it was an open secret for over a year). I never told anyone I had the impediment, so, despite therapy as a kid, it was obviously still a problem.

So, fuck it. I decided to jump into the ocean and sink or swim. A car insurance claim call-center for a stutterer was scary. A daily workout of all-day phone calls, angry drivers, customer service expectations, no "outs" like swear words, drinking games, or wonky behavior to hide behind. I was like that desert fox learning to swim, telling himself, "I'm getting better!."

And it was far worse than I thought. The insurance company wanted adjusters to answer ever more phone calls. To incentive us, they'd ring a monotone "bell" because… I don't know.  They never said why (probably because they're stuck in the Industrial Age) we employees learned questioning "the bell" was a bad idea. Management used it as punishment; "answer more phone calls or we'll make the bell faster and louder!"

I'm being serious by the way. We were often more stressed then the person who just had a car crash. Whatever the reason, DING-DING-DING-DING almost all day, which gave people who weren't stutterers tremendous anxiety, breakdowns, and stress leaves.

Super-shock speech therapy! After about a year, I didn't have to massage my jaws at night to release it from all the teeth shattering jaw-clenches I did to divert vocal stuttering. I was cured!

The point is this. That's what it took for me to improve my fluency greatly. It's like night and day. The anxiety washed away. A hidden outgoing personality was brought out and frankly is fun, although still surreal, to be. I often feel out of place and of two minds—like a desert fox joining a scuba diving club.

Charles never had this lesson. Despite being adamant he was God's chosen leader, he was famously shy and quiet his whole life because that's how the gremlin likes it. Even when fighting for 16 years defending his ruling philosophy, Charles still probably had to massage his strained jaws every night. I can sympathize. The gremlin is an asshole.

Charles was accused of being "a Tyrant, A Traitor, Murderer, and a public enemy to the Commonwealth of England." This was a watershed moment in modern human history. For the first time the people weren't replacing one king for another. They were killing the king, and replacing him with themselves. The people would be their own player god.

And at this historic moment, Charles wasn't pretending or bluffing to not understand his supposed charges of tyranny. He wasn't proud or stubborn. Like Hugh Auld, or Agent Smith, he was a honest defender of the Matrix. A believer the rulebook was just, and not a Death Star that holds back progress. Charles was the hero of a dying philosophy. Thus, Charles could not psychologically understand being wrong. In his mind Antagonist Kings were impossible. So at his trial he—apparently on purpose—said nothing.

The judges convicted Charles anyway. He was sentenced to death by removing the head from the body. The convicted king was astounded. His next chance to speak would be at his own chopping block.

![New Tool Creation](/img\diagrams\techvolution-whitehall-charles.jpg)
_This is Whitehall. A palace built by Henry VIII. Charles waited here for his death; was executed on a scaffold outside this room. On the ceiling is a painting commissioned by his father which shows James I being taken to heaven by angels. Charles was raised his entire life to be a divine king. Could you see outside the divine rights of nobles if you were him?_

## Charles Speaks

Fuck the ringing bell of a claims department, imagine the stress of a stutterer minutes from execution, having to say something to defend 16 years of civil war, his throne, and his family's place in history. I can't explain how anxious he would have been. I'm sure he feared the pain of not saying anything more than getting his head chopped off.

And on the scaffold, at his own chopping block, he had his last chance to say thing. And… And... no stutter. Not once!

Charles didn't just speak, he spoke so eloquently many people, even those who hated him, were impressed. I must say I'm happy for him. I can say beyond any doubt he was in that gorgeous room, looking up at his father's painting, praying to say the thoughts in his mind. And when Charles spoke clearly, it for sure felt like the angels on his fathers shoulders, killed the gremlin for the holy king. In Charles' mind, not stuttering felt like divine intervention. What vindication! Indeed, Charles's last words were a clearly spoken:

> Truly I desire their (the people's) liberty and freedom as much as anybody whomsoever; but I must tell you their liberty and freedom consist in having of government, those laws by which their life and their goods may be most their own. It is not for having a share in government, Sir, that is nothing pertaining to them. A subject and a ruler are clear different things... therefore I tell you that I am the Martyr of the people. I die a Christian according to the profession of the Church of England, as I found it left me by my father... I have a good Cause and I have a gracious God. I will say no more.

Clearly spoken words because Charles was positive he was correct. In the end, his surety killed the gremlin. But he was totally behind the time. He gave England 16 of civil war because he thought he was a living god. The truth was the Vikings and anarchy were gone. Civilization had returned. Europe was safe and prosperous. Kings were no longer needed. The people could rule themselves as player gods. Charles should have been happy his children grew up. He could have helped them grow up by conceding powers to Parliament and avoiding 16 years of war. Instead, he lived in splendor, hide behind spectacle, and used the people's money to hire foreigners to kill them.

Later kings still didn't learn. Even more distanced from the frontline inside their palaces, banquets and balls. Many more Darth Kings faced the chopping block with the voice of God calling them martyrs. The irony was, their stubbornness caused real protagonists like Rousseau, Washington, and Jefferson to rise up. These protagonists used new tools and a new philosophy to empower the people to become player gods and share in the responsibility of government.

Remember this story. Darth Blockbuster won't "see the light".  You have to become a player god and take responsibility for the politics of your community by reaching for new digital tools regardless of any rules telling you not to. And you already are. It was when the people felt the majic of the printing press, scientific instruments, and gun, they became player gods. And that's why you are by default a believer in Techvolution. Because you're using computers and the internet. The tools of the Internet Age that empower you to become today's new player god.

## The Majic of the Internet - If We Use the Internet, We Automatically Fight For the Internet Age

The Internet Age has many protagonists. Paul Baran (1926-2011) is one of the big ones. Because of him, just by using the internet, you become a player god. No kidding around. Personal freedom, responsibility, and collaboration are built into the DNA of the internet we all use everyday.

On the face of it, the internet is a boring data network. There are many ways of making a data network. The simplest is how phone systems do it with a direct circuit link between two phones. With this kind of network, all connections go through a central hub. Each connection is a direct link between two people that stops the moment the connection drops.

Alexander Graham Bell invented these "direct circuit links" in 1876. He put it into action when he co-founded the American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T) in 1885. For generations, direct links were how all telecommunications worked. But when the Soviets tested a hydrogen bomb in 1955, Baran took it upon himself to make a new network. He wanted to prevent a nuclear holocaust; quite the protagonist I must say.

Baran realized to prevent nuclear war, the world needed a communications network that would survive an atomic attack. Only robust and reliable communications would ease American and Soviet trigger fingers during tense times.

For years, after his day job, Baran worked all alone. By 1960 he came up with the two ideas he needed. The first was that his network should have no central hubs (like telephones have) to control the flow of information. Central hubs make systems vulnerable to attack or failure. Instead data flow should be distributed so every node can send and receive information equally. Baran's nodes network looks like a fishnet. Because its distributed, it can survive any attack.

Next, Baran had to figure out how to send information across the network. This led to his second idea, which was to break up the data into standard-size little packets. Each message would be broken into many packets, each of which would scurry along different paths through the network's nodes and be reassembled when they got to their destination. If one packet didn't get there in time, it was quickly resent. This way, there'd be no "dropped calls" and communication would always stay open. Baran published his ideas into very detailed technical specs and made sure everyone, especially the Soviets, could copy his work. These specs created the internet. But only in theory.

When Baran tried to give his specs away, he walked into a nest of antagonists. When Baran's employer RAND recommended his "node-packet data network" idea to the Air Force (in control of America's nuclear missiles), they wanted to build it. But when the Department of Defense got itself and the Defense Communications Agency involved Baran soon found out working with so many bureaucrats was hopeless.

So Baran tried to convince AT&T, in control of America's telephone network, to supplement their system with his node-packet data network. "They fought it tooth and nail," he recalled. "They tried all sorts of things to stop it." They would not even let RAND use the maps of its circuits, so Baran had to use a pirated set. Baran made several trips to AT&T headquarters in lower Manhattan. On one of them, a senior executive—who was an old engineer—looked stunned when Baran explained that his system would mean that data could go back and forth without a dedicated link remaining open. "He looked at his colleagues in the room while his eyeballs rolled up, sending a signal of his utter disbelief," according to Baran. After a pause, the executive said, "Son, here's how a telephone works," and explained a patronizing and simplistic description.

Good thing Jedi's don't give up. Baran continued to push. AT&T finally had him and other outsiders to a series of seminars explaining how its telephone system worked. "It took ninety-four separate speakers to describe the entire system," Baran marveled. When it was over, the AT&T executives asked Baran, "Now do you see why packet switching wouldn't work?" To their great disappointment, Baran simply replied, "No."

To heck with Darth Telephone!

Years later, Baran's network was built when the US government's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) saw the wisdom in a node-packet distributed communications network. In 1969 ARPA used Baran's technical specs to build ARPAnet, the first version of the internet. Although it's grown bigger and faster, the internet is still technically unchanged from its 1969 version. That's why within the DNA of the internet we use everyday, is an information netwowrk no one can control.

But the internet wasn't built by lone geniuses. It was a culture of collaboration that kickstarted the Internet Act. At places like Bell Labs, IBM, Fairchild Semiconductor, Intel, and Apple, millions of technicians, welders, engineers, electrical workers, tool makers, physicists, chemists, designers, marketers, machinists. The Internet Age was born, when Main Street collaborated to invent the future. Just a taste for what greatness the era of mass-collaboration will do for our unhappy civilization.

The majic of the internet attracts us all. We use laptops, smartphones, iMessage, Facetime, Reddit, and so many other internet services. We evolve our cyborgology everytime we use a new online tool. Yet, we also don't appreciate how much our tools change our mentality. Free speech, the right to vote, love of scientific truth, all came once we held their corresponding tools. The majic of learning new tools also gives us a new philosophy. We don't realize it until a Douglas, Rousseau or Neo explain the new philosophy to us.

The internet was created to survive a nuclear bomb. Think of how powerful it must be. No one can control it. No professor, executive, president, or king can shut it down. An individual has the exact same access as any corporation or government. The internet lets individuals communicate, work, and collaborate together with no middlemen. That's why the internet is majical. Whoever uses it, is automatically evolved. You already believe in Techvolution. You're already empowered to live inside the Internet Age's era of mass-collaboration. But only when you realize it.

_Paul Baran's story was adapted from Walter Isaacson's awesome book_ The Innovators: Chapter 7.

## Time to Act Stargazer

So you're a believer in Techvolution. I know what because you're using a computer and the internet to read this now. Majic got you to learn both. Majic made you upgrade your cyborgology and thereby evolve life on Earth. With that evolution, whether you realize it or not, comes a belief in the right and duty to evolve humanity into the Internet Age.

Darth Blockbuster stands in Techvolution's way. He uses dark majic to keep you using Industrial Age tools. When the spectacle wears off, he uses his Death Star to make the Internet Age tools and mentalities against the rules.

We're in a dilemma, much like Darth King, Darth Blockbuster doesn't hate us. He's stuck in the Matrix. Or better put, he's stuck inside the old red/blue philosophy of the Industrial Age. Darth Blockbuster is an unknowing antagonist of the future. It's kind of tragic if you think about it. He'll never see his error. It's almost like Nature made him so blind, so the people on the frontline have to look for a new and better way to live.

That's why I'm not writing to "The Executive." I'm writing to you Stargazer. All you have to do, is see the Matrix that makes you an extra of the Industrial Age. If you use, promote, and fight for Techvolution, an unhappy life inside the heavy management and competition of the era of mass production will end. You'll finally enjoy all the benefits of the Internet Age and its facilitation of mass-collaboration.

ILLUSTRATION

That's you in the illustration. Your job is to do what's best for yourself, and help society prosper. You're looking up for guidance and see two options. Open-source heroes of the Internet Age who've never stopped innovating and thinking ahead. And the self-importance and short-sightedness of Darth Blockbuster, the fallen and stubborn hero of the Industrial Age.

The only question is, what philosophy do you believe in? The one that clicks creates your ruling philosophy. The ruling philosophy is the mythical "player god" in the sky; who you control, if you want to. Deciding the ruling philosophy is the power of an empowered Main Street—empowered now with the tools to see the difference between Protagonist vs. Antagonist. Inventor vs. Noble. Jedi vs. Sith.

The fate of civilization is then, rather simple. Who is your hero Stargazer? Will you be a player god or an extra? We all await your choice. The conclusion of Techvolution: A New Philosophy is thus a simple discussion inside your head. Which might look something like this.

## Extra vs Player God

Our story takes us to Anytown in Western Civilization. From Austrailia's high heat, to England's rainy shores, to coast to coast in the United States of America. Our story plays out in Western Civilization. Where today's wealthy capitalist democracies who use red/blue philosophy, obesses about mass production, and tell their members to compete to rise inside a bureaucratic or corporate heirarchy. All relics from the Industrial Age culture, that peaked in 1969.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/WarmNippyCockatiel' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

_Watch the entire thing if you can. Ricky Gervais is yelling at a heirarchy, who are so distanced from the frontline, they've lost touch. They virtue signal, as Christian nobility once did, to make themselves feel better._

## The End

If someone were to tell you how to vote, while looking over your shoulder, you'd be weirded out and call the police. Society would rush to defend you, because we all agree nobody should tell you, nor force you, how to vote. You yourself haven't done anything to earn that right. It's something our Rousseau inspired, player god, ancestors earned for us.

Now it's our turn. The solution to our political and economic problems is upgrading to the Internet Age and embracing the era of mass-collaboration. To do that, we need Techvolution, a new philosophy that gives the right, and duty, to frontline people to use digital tools to solve their real-life problems. Letting antagonists decide is stupid. Believing in Left/Right philosophies is a recipe for living in the past.

Donald Trump is thus, really the savior of Western Civilization. This time that statement isn't rhetorical. Trump is our saviour; not because of his policies, but because he's such a departure from the Right/Left mold, he makes us think, "what politics do I want?". And asking that question is the first step. No president, if you cheer or fear, is ever the hero. You are. If you take the job of a player god. Donald Trump is the hero, only because he let us ask, "do I want to be the hero of Western Civilization?"

We can all enjoy the era of mass-collaboration now, if you stop watching the story of civlization as an extra. We don't need revolutions or wars. Not even marches or protests. Whereever you are, look around, and see old drafty windows, gas engine car, cable news, mass-producted toys, eight different bosses, car traffic, endless red-tape...

Do you see the Industrial Age? Are you willing to drop the tools of 1969 cyborg, and ask yourself, what cyborg do I need to be, to solve frontline problems, and evolve my civilization to the era of mass-collaboration in the Internet Age? Do you understand that if you control your part of society, that makes you politically powerful. Simply reaching for the Internet Age tool, destroyed Darth Blockbuster. Do you want to keep doing it?

Or do you want to return to the comfort and safety of being a 1969 cyborg, bragging about gas cars, and granite countertops, while following the antagonists rules, and chasing the phantoms of Conservative/Progressive politics. Did Techvolution click? The fate of your life, and of your society, rests on the simple question—will you step up and become a player god in the game of civlization?

If you do, we win. If you don't, we lose.

# EPILOGUE

## Frontline Pain Kickstarts Evolution

I had a heck of a time writing this book. It really does condense so much political theory. I was pretty tired, and kind of bitter to be honest. Then I watched an episode of Netflix’s _Black Mirror_ and went back to work.

This episode was the tale of a crazed man, who wants to talk with the powerful CEO of an Instagram-like app called Smithereens. He holds a company intern hostage, awaiting the CEO’s call. Police surround him, corporate lackies try to deflect him, bullets are fired at him, but he still wants his phone call. Nobody knows why.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/TheseColossalHousefly' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

New technology is either our salvation. Or our distraction. These are the poor souls car insurance adjusters speak to. While most aren't so devastated, far too many are. Crashes, deaths, hijackings, murders, drive-bys, car fires, everyone calls into insurance eventually. And all the while BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP.

Car crashes kill tens of thousands of people each year. Hundreds of thousands more are injured. And million of lives are changed. We spend about 200 billion every year on car accident insurance claims. That's about ten times NASA's budget.

At it's heart, Smithereens is a story about an extra. The tortured man assumes Smithereens will care. Extras assume "they" have the people's best interest at heart. "They" in government bureaucracy. "They" in corporations. "They" someone else. "They" only have your interest at heart if you bring power to the table, that forces them to make a deal with you. And to have power you must control a tool that makes you powerful.

When I watched Smithereens I actually wept. I knew what the plot twist was—that someone died in a car crash—because I'd spoken with this person too many times. It was actually the reason I made my app. I wanted to showcase how the future of technology will help us solve things like horrible, useless, and preventable car crashes with something called the Life Star. What I ended up learning, is before we get to the Internet Age and mass-collaboration, we'll need player gods using Techvolution to make it happen.

## My App - A Taste of the Life Star

I never intended to write this book. I wrote a similar one, "Why the 2008 Economic Crisis Was Only the Beginning" years ago (although I never showed anyone). All the points from here are there—although it's not written quite as well.

I wanted (and am), writing "Building the Life Star" and "Starting Starfleet." Which in summary say, digital tools will start giving us objective facts about whose civilization and whose individual lives are more efficient, which will let us start saving oddles of money, and thus empower us to have much more efficient civilizations. With all the savings, we'll start the Space Exploration Age.

So I made my app to demonstrate those two facts. Using modern web development, it took just a few months of work. Take some free code from GitHub, an inexpensive cloud computing account, and the design skills of a novice. It was simple. Might not even get me a job in "tech."

The tool wasn’t polished because new tools never are. But it was, and would have been, so effective because it came directly from the frontline. The place where evolution happens, but a place far away from today’s gatekeepers. And while I always knew those inside head offices were hostile to Internet Age upgrades—I didn't realize they actually feared evolution.

Here’s how my app worked. Today’s car insurance claim system depends on drivers exchanging information after a car accident. Drivers are frazzled so they usually don’t. A simple mistake that causes a big problem; because we adjusters had to search for each other. Literally calling around or hoping someone calls you. Delays piled up like crazy. Which was the biggest reason for all the maddening DING DING DING DING DING DING.

My app combined several existing technologies, email, internet, GPS, google maps, and web apps, to make a new tool. It let insurance adjusters post an accident on a google map. Since every accident shares the GPS coordinates, all adjusters, regardless of what drivers do, can find each other. It’s minimal operating cost was paid for by rental car companies and repair shops, who loved the ability to email invoices directly to adjusters without having to call first.

![New Tool Creation](/img\diagrams\techvolution-civilization-is-here.jpg)
_Look familiar? I told you computers games teach us about the Internet Age. A sneak peek at the Lifestar._

A simple new tool that only someone on the frontline would ever feel the pain to make. A bit of human technological evolution. With no exaggeration, society would have saved hundreds of millions in insurance claim operating costs. That’s cool. Adjusters, service reps, and drivers would save hours of their day. That’s cool too; all ways to make middle-class life happier and showcase how great the era of mass-collaboration is.

Mass-collaboration is the basis of the Life Star. And this is the reason it's worth fighting for. With my small little app, for the first time, we’d have a database of the exact location and causes of car accidents. Thereafter we could cross reference with weather, traffic, demographics, and many other databases. We’d finally learn why car accidents happen, and start to fight back.

_Ontario police use Twitter to tell the public car crashes. People in this feed, are going through what the Netflix clip above showcases. And the today's Death Star said it was moral and just to stop it._

A database of accident locations and causes doesn’t exist today. Government regulators don't care about it. Insurance company managers don't care about it. Extras tell themselves "they" are doing it all. So, when tree branches grow over stop signs, tires are faulty, intersections jam up too much, pot holes get too big, or anything else repeatedly causes accidents, we don’t even know. With a database, machine learning and artificial intelligence, we’d find trends to the millions of accidents, and tens of thousands of deaths that happen every year.

Right and Left governments have been voted in to lower accidents, road traffic, and insurance rates throughout North America. Each has only gotten worse because none of these problems are a regulatory problem. Government can't do much, if anything, about them.

Crashes are a technological problem. Our cars don't have sensors or cameras. Our claims are processed over telephone calls and paperwork. With a modern claim system we'd process claims far faster, and start to prevent accidents. We'd save tons of money, time, grief, road traffic, and many lives. But none of this will happen unless Main Street steps up. Without Techvolution, the powers of the Industrial Age will keep the future back for as long as possible.

These powers don’t feel frontline pain. In my case executives, lawyers, brokers, marketers, and consultants. All they had was reasons and excuses. They didn’t care about the future of technology, and didn't know one thing about their own industry. Not one. Car accidents are as mysterious to them as how to take out the trash. Their self-entitlement, blank faces, clueless looks, arrogant smirks, angered me so much it merged years of political theory in my mind, and let me see a new ruling philosophy called Techvolution in my head. And that's why I wrote this book. It's a blueprint for the world under the Life Star.

I did my best as a protagonist. I was not good enough to prevent anyone’s Smithereens, but I did my best. The point isn’t that I wallowed in self-pity or guilt. The point is that neither needs to exist in the Internet Age. Because the Life Star will make frontline pain the only judge of right and wrong. Antagonists will be accountable for their positions, jobs, and actions. The people's anguish, like in the Smithereens clips, won't have to beg to see the gatekeeper. The Life Star will bring the pain of life, and the decision to evolve life, so close together, no antagonist will fall down from heaven again.

Because soon Evolution will be our rulebook. No middleman. No phantom chasing. No dark majic. No Death Star. No Darth Blockbuster. Would you be a player god, if the only person judging you, was the same person that judges oak trees, cheetahs, and polar bears? You would be, or Evolution will get rid of you. That's the Life Star. The technological re-creation of Naure and Evolution; a rulebook to enforce Techvolution. While it's better if Techvolution clicks now, if it didn't, I guarantee you, this new ruling philosophy will click in the future. You'll read all about it in the next book.

# THE APPENDICES

## The End of One Game, and the Beginning of a New One

This section is my personal opinion, so take it for what it's worth to you.

The Western World is a made up term. Don't get me wrong, it's a good way to describe the shared culture of France, Britain, Holland, America, Austrialia and the other members of the political unit we call "The West". But if you look down at the globe, these landmasses wouldn't look united. The West is a human creation. There was no "Western Europe" in Roman times. The entire Mediterranean Sea and surrouning land was unified under the Roman Empire.

It wasn't until western Rome fell in 476, and North Africa was conquered in the 700s, that what we call Western Europe became isolated, and hence got its own identity. It was these once barbarian germanic tribes, newly converted to Christianity and loyal to the idea of Rome, who laid the seeds for Western Civilization. The first kings of Western Europe survived the Dark Ages. They slowly returned civilization in the Medieval Ages. By the time the Renaissance Age came, Western Europe was doing quite well. But it was in the Science Age and the Industrial Age, that the West saw their power grow world wide.

If the world had ended in 1900, The West would have won the game of civilization. Western Europe didn't have a head start. They didn't have any sort of advantage. If it's geography, resources, genes, or whatever were the reason for the West's rise to power, why did western Rome fall?

Western Europe simply used modern technology better than any other civilization. That's because philosophy is a gift. It lets humanity invent and use new and better tools. Ancient Greece got it first, then it went to Rome, then to Middle East in the Islamic Golden Age, back to Italy in the Renaissance, where it spread to Western Civilization during the Science and Industrial Age, and thereafter to the world via colonialization.

Updating, or "clicking", a new philosophy is pivotal when civilization games for a good reason. Society has to keep doing it. Because the game of civilization never ends. Famines, wars, prosperity, climate change; clicking new philosophies is the only way to keeping inventing new tools, harvesting more resources, and surviving the game. There are antagonists inside every society. That's no excuse to stop playing. The rest of society either defeats them, or their civilization is replaced by another player and the idle extras still lose; their DNA is out of the gene pool either way.

Playing Civilzation, Anno 1800, or any other game is a better education than the best schooling today. These games mimick real-life, and thus integrate so many lessons. It's actually hard to appreciate. But it's invaluable, especially to our society which is so obessed with itself, inside our spectacle and art stories.

Our culture is very entrenched in the Industrial Age. So many people live to take credit for titles, instead of accomplisments. Professors, managers, executives, union leaders, all cherish the title of Industrial Age heirarchies. These well-intentioned people, don't want to return back to equality that happens at the start of every new age. They refuse to upgrade our philosophy. Or they want someone else to. The result is, the West is in the process of losing the game.

We are in an entirely new age. The Internet Age is just as historical and powerful as the Science Age. And nobody has earned victory over it yet. Africa, South America, East Asia, Middle East, India, Eastern Europe, any civilization in the world is no better off then the West. Actually, I'd say, the West is far behind in the race to win the Internet Age

In all my schooling, reading, discussing, working, in all my life, the ancestors of the barbarian kings, the ones whose grand parents worked 365 days a year in horrible English factories, who suffered famines in Ireland, draughts in France, and wars throughout Europe, the ones who did work in the labs in New York, who worked the mines of Pennsylvania, the lines of Michigan, who solve millionsd of different problems during the Science and Industrial Ages as player gods; their grandkids today simple don't want to feel frontline pain. As one sharp observer noted to me "it's like they've folded their cards."

It's why so many of todays Western protagonists and player gods are foreigners. Also why so many tortured souls are born with irrationality (mental illness) in western society. Society is using their curse, to be irrational against the corrupt rulebook, and start involuntarily discovering the just rulebook of the next Age. Irrational people are the most likely to see through the Matrix and start the rebellion. The curse is to live the rebellion of the mind history demands somebody makes. That's the rationality of irrationality. The longer we hold off upgrading, the most cursed minds our player god is forced to make to starting winning the game again.

Fighting to delay the upgrade, is also why so many antagonists import extras (illegal immigration, migrant crisis, legal immigration) into the West, because they know desperate people are inherent extras, and only a society of extras, keeps antagonists of the Internet Age in power in the 21st Century.

_This the Antagonist Executive at work. No jokes, too many know how real this is. Darth Blockbuster's delusion of being the leader, despite personal incompetence, lasts until player gods rise up. I feel like I'm watching Charles trying to make battle plans. I can't help but see "the decline and fall" in this sketch._

Modern technology is so powerful, it overcomes any natural drawback like language, geography, or history some places in the world have. That means the winner of the Internet Age is up for grabs. I don't know who will win. I do suspect though, the people of the West are dead-set on celebrating away their ancestors glory, quite literally living off their inheritance, and happily going down with the ship that was Western Civilization. One thing I do know, that whichever society throws away the memories, excuses, and philosphies of the past, and embraces Techvolution and the era of mass-collaboration, will be the winner of the Internet Age. And it's this player god that will happily reign supreme for many years in the never ending game of civilization. I smile, thinking of all those bakers, tailors, designers, roofers, engineers, cleaners, repairmen, and maybe even a few majicians, smiling on a new and empowered Main Street.

Hopefully they'll colonize the West, and so, bring on the Internet Age to the world. At least with this book, those people in what remains of the West, can read what their grandparents could have done as they regret the choices of player gods who lost because they refused to play the game.

## Stuff I Couldn't Fit In

I tried to make Techvolution very readable. It needed to be. Almost all the topics and subjects are metaphors for the lessons Europe learned going from the Dark Ages, through the Medieval Ages, to the Science Age, Enlightenment Age, and finally the Industrial Age. So there was a lot of stuff to fit it. If you're a history or philosophy nerd, I hope you realize why I synthesized things the way I did. The benefit was, by keeping things simple, I was forced to better understand the content.

Without changing our path (which I mentioned above, I don't see coming) The West really is headed towards societal failure, a new version of the Thirty Years War. That's not supposed to sound alarmist. It's a diagnosis using our history. Every new age needs a new philosophy that unites the people into thinking of the big picture and making a new player god. Unless we create a player god in an era of mass-collaborationone soon, we wont stay ahead of our problems and people will fight for a better life using the philosophy of the past; just like our ancestors fought against Catholicism and Protestantism when the real enemy was nobility.

If I could travel back to 1618 to those very unhappy Europeans on Main Street, I'd say the same thing to them I told you. But they wouldn't believe it because I'd be talking about the future. With you it's been the past. There's a better chance it'll all click.

By clcking of course I mean upgrading our philosophy. While there are always lots of lessons in all philosophy books, in the game of civilization, certain cards or philosophical upgrades are much more important than others. For reference, here's some of the lessons our ancestors taught us in blood, sweat, and tears, and I used in this book.

===

**Modernity**: Inspired by the Renaissance, and started during the Age of Enlightenment. Modernity makes the point when we got modern technology and made modern philosophies. The printing-press, telescope, microscope, and so forth, let humanity develop better philosophies to explain Nature. If I were to have written this book another way, I'd have said modernity is hitting the social sciences, as it did years ago to the physical sciences. Postmodernism and its friends in Left and Right, are phantom chasing geocentrics trying to validate their bygone belief system against the rising tide of evidence a new philosophy is needed.

The point it, we can take all the lessons of the first wave of modernity, and apply it to the second, which is what I did here by referencing the works from Machiavelli to Hegel, but excluded anyone after, because none of them integrated the technological possibilities of the Internet Age. They are like the geocentrics who tried to keep everyone believing the Earth stood still, even after a new and better philosophy was being discovered.

That's why science fiction writers are much better to study then any post modern (supposed) thinker.

**Phantom Communists and Fascists**: The Renaissance, and Scienge Age, was kicked started by Nicolo Machiavelli, who was among the first to implore humanity study cause and effect, to improve our lives on Earth. He asked his contempories to ignore the  "Imagined Principalities" of religious people, who had the people ignoring their real-life pain, because of a belief they'll be rewarded in the afterlife. Any philosophy based on the way things ought to be, had people complain about the real-world, instead of accepting the facts of life, and trying to improve them. Machiavelli called heaven "Imagined Principalities".

Christian belief about an afterlife helped Medieval peasants stay loyal as their community was slowly rebuilding civlization. But by the Renaissance and afterward, only thikning of the afterlife was a needless distraction. Civilization had upgraded, and needed Main Street to start being selfish and take the lead as scientists, doctors, writers and so forth.

I'm making the same point here. That Main Street is distracted from modern philosophy, by holdovers. Just as geocentrics stayed alive by telling the population about "heretic Galileo!", so does our old philosophies stay alive by cries of "they're evil". Instead of "Imagined Principalities" we have "Phantom Communists and Fascists".

**Frontline**: is Machiavelli's "effectual truth." Machiavelli came from a relatively poor family. But he was well educated, and his father gave him many books from the recent printing press. Machiavelli was the first philosoper to get to read lots of different philosophy and history books, and he noticed trends. He told superstitious Europeans, they didn't need to put their faith in God, because we can keep looking for trends, master them, and start to overcome problems like hunger, disease, and all that.

Soon later Galileo, Francis Bacon, and lots of other people, read this insight, and invented the Scientific Method, which systemized looking for "effectual truth" by simply testing Nature with instruments, and discovering the truth, not inventing it with beliefs or reason. Hence, true truth is the "point of contact" between a tool and it's use. That's true in a scientific experiment that upgraded the physical sciences. And now, it's true in the second wave of modernity that will upgraded the social sciences. And for that, the frontline of everyday life is where we'll find the true answers; not the rules of the social or noble heirarchy.

**Player god**: Is my way of saying political community, what Plato called "politia". My version comes from Thomas Hobbes. He lived during the English Civil War, when people were again sick of the king but didn't yet have a different ruling philosophy to replace him with. Hobbes invented human equality by saying in Nature (he called it the State of Nature), all lifeforms live freely, thus why shouldn't humans. Hobbes said people should still be loyal to a king, but not because the king is divine, but because one person having absolute power is in everyone's best interest to have a stable and firm government. When that goes away—as Hobbes was personally seeing—people turn horrible.

And this is what I mean by each philosophy contributed partial upgrades. Because while we don't have kings anymore, yet we use much of Hobbes reasoning. John Locke came after Hobbes and agreed with his State of Nature, but said the people didn't need to put all their trust into a person as leader, but instead put their trust in the institution as leader. Meaning, the people should follow a president, not a king. Moreever, government should be split into different responsibilities for executive, legislature, and judicial. This way, each will "check and balance" each other, and thus government will still function, but won't be easily corrupted and become worse than the anarchy it's supposed to solve.

Rousseau later came and said a true democracy is made up of the people. Unlike Hobbes/Locke, who said humanity was not born from a chaotic Nature, but a kind one. In fact, it's society that corrupts people into being evil. Thus, it's up the way society is structured to ensure the best of humanity is brought up, instead of repressed. Rousseau made the connection that individuals make up their society, so if each individual reformed themselves, they'd all make a better society.

While Rousseau's visions lead to a lot of social engineering disasters. Modern technology and especially open-source, is so liberating, and so individually empowering, we can make a good and just player god. We can have the best of both worlds, a stable government and society, that doesn't need to, and in fact can't, oppress the people.

**The Game of Civilization vs. The Story of Civilization**: Machiavelli's "wised up". Meaning when a civilization is self-aware it takes its survival seriously and not for granted, and thus plays the game, instead of passively watching the events as if it can't determine it's own outcome.

**Your Happiness**: The best gauge on how healthy the player god is.

**Heirarchy**:: is from the friction of distance. The farther people are from the pain, the more likely they're disregard it. So for all her faults, Sofia Auld did teach an enslaved person to read. That's only because she spent time with him everyday. Natural humanity comes out with empathy. And empathy needs to be seen, heard, and felt to exist. That sad truth was, the further away a slave owner was, the more terrible their treatments of slaves. I hate talking like this, and so did Douglass, but a house slave was treated better than a farm slave, who was better off than a plantation slave, who was better off than a colonial slave whose (asshole) "owners" were in a different country. Proximity brings more humanity.

Feeling the pain is the best way to respond to it. The further one is from the frontline, the less natural morality and ethics will prompt a humane response. We use products made by slave labour because we don't feel or see it. Civlizations need heirachries, but with better technology, we don't as much. Thus as civilization needs better technology, that inevitable means dismantling heirarchies is progress.

**The Power of Stories**: Aristotle's Poetics, and especially David Mamet's On Directing Film. Learning storytelling so darn well, it's layers and components, characters and motivations, is what I used to intepret Hegelian dialectics. I'm writing "How to See the Matrix" using these tools. It's much more detailed analysis of all this stuff.

**Ruling philosophy**: comes from Aristotle's regmine. Regime is the form of government or the set of rules, cultural or social norms, etc. that regulate the operation of a government or institution and its interactions with society. Aristotle noted  the forms of government are democracy, oligarchy, aristocracy, monarchy. The supreme right to judge and decide is with with either a part or the whole of one or other of these governing powers; which together make up a socieyt's regmine or ruling philosophy.

A Democracy is a form of government under which the citizens distribute the offices of state among themselves, whereas under oligarchy there is a property qualification, under aristocracy one of education. By education I mean that education which is laid down by the law; for it is those who have been loyal to the national institutions that hold office under an aristocracy. These are bound to be looked upon as 'the best men', and it is from this fact that this form of government has derived its name ('the rule of the best'). Monarchy, as the word implies, is a rule which one man has authority over all. There are two forms of monarchy: kingship, which is limited by prescribed conditions, and 'tyranny', which is not limited by anything.

We must also notice the ends which the various forms of government pursue. The end of democracy is freedom; of oligarchy, wealth; of aristocracy, the maintenance of power, education, and national institutions; of tyranny, the protection of the tyrant.

**Protagonist and antagonist**: is Hegel's Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis dialectics. After centuries of histories, looked back at the trends, and said there was a ruling philosophy, whose problems manifested into a competitor, the two would eventually fight it out, and make a new ruling philosphy that merged the two together. He also said master–slave is a relationship that recurs throughout humanity, and is the reason we looked at Frederick Douglas and Neo, who while was the physical slave, his captors were the mental ones, bound to a horrible social system as much as Frederick was. Frederick's process of self-discovery, was how slaves realize their status and break free.

**Cyborgology, majic, frontline**: are Darwinism. The evolution of lifeforms based on their tools to collect resources. Life started out as simple organisms, and as these primitive lifeforms struggled to survive, they adapted better —biological—tools to do so. Eventually the benefits of biology maxed out with us, and so we have to continue evolution with tools. We similarly started to evolve (techvolve) with primitive tools, which slowly got better and better.

**Death Star**: working insurance.

**Freedom to use any tool**: Comes from freedom of religion and speech. John Locke and his A Letter Concerning Toleration, gets the nod here.

**Dark majic**: come from modern psychology. All of this is hard to understand. It seems simple because it's your life, and you think your opinions matter. But there's a reason we go to the doctor when we're feeling sick. They know the human antonmy, and we don't, even though we own one.

**Techvolution**: Comes from me. It synthesizes all that we've learned, into a new philosophy for a modern age. I attributed much of it to playing computer games, reading and watching science fiction, and working lots of frontline jobs. Playing, reading, and living in the future made the old philosophies of 20th Century politics so old fashioned. Putting it all together into a book took lots of reading, thinking, and working. Some intelligence helped, but it was the stubborness to keep going, and the belief in a higher power, that deserves the most credit. I hope it was worth it.

===

So, that's where it all came from. Machiavelli taught regular people to stop hoping for a better life, and start making one. Hobbes/Locke taught us our government can be instruments for liberty. Rousseau said we, the people, could make up government if we empowered our better natures. Hegel taught us the difference between Protagonsits and Antagonists, Player Gods, and Extras. Galileo taught us to use tools to see the Truth. Darwin taught us life is nothing but the evolution of new tools. And Majic, he taught us that technology is an extension of life, that player gods can use to improve this world, once we believe in ourselves. Or he wasted far too much time writing to himself. Either way, it's confusing and fitting Faith made him keep going.
