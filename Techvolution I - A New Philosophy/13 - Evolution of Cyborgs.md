# The Magic of Evolution

Well, Skywalker, before you go off and face Darth Blockbuster, you have to learn some things. The most important being the all powerful energy field inside every lifeform. No not the Force. I mean evolution.

Evolution empowers life. It gives every new lifeform a slightly different variation. This is how life tests for environmental changes like water levels, temperature, food supply. The variations who can't cut it slowly die, while the fittest survive and make more variations. That's how evolution naturally selects which lifeforms best represent life on Earth.

Life loves biodiversity. More lifeforms means life can better probe and therefore better adapt to environmental changes. When temperatures increase or rain patterns change, the sooner any lifeform feels the pain of change, the sooner life can adapt.

Evolution may not be the Force, but it's certainly magical. Without any lifeform being aware of its tricks, evolution turned a lifeless planet into its oasis. The big drawback is time. Biological variations take millions of years to respond to environmental changes. Think of the poor polar bears. They'll never understand why the ice isn't coming. Even if they could, no lifeform proactively change their biology.

In contrast, humanity can (hopefully in time to help the polar bears). Not our biology. But our "cyborgology" if you will. And while evolution maybe magical, creating new tools isn't. It's intentional. We reflect on our problems and create a new tool to overcome it.

This is how Techvolution works. It's intentionally evolvution. A better form of evolution that isn't a magical mystery, like evolution is to polar bears, but something we can understand. Question is, what drives us to evolve, when the rules often say it's wrong?

## The Majic of Techvolution

Creating new tools is called innovation. We already understand and celebrate innovation. Even Darth Blockbuster often loves new tools. Innovating new tools isn't our problem however. We need people to actually use them. Yet it's often against the rules.

What trick does nature play on us to evolve. Because the extras, the ones suffering the pain of the frontline and probing for solutions, need to upgrade themselves. Techvolution is a new ruling philosophy to empower extras to naturally select their own tools. But why do they, and how can we encourage more of it.

First off, the process by which extras decide to drop one tool, and pick up another, needs a term. It's not the magic of evolution, because extras understand they're swopping out the DVD player for Netlix. Yet, it's still quite wonderfully mystical choosing to leave ones's comfort zone, throw away an old tool, and learn a one. It's like an desert fox deciding she's leaving for jungle.

It's so wonderfully brave, mysterious, and rare, I call it majic. Pronounced like magic, but different so we know it's the free choice of a regular person to use a new tool, solve a problem, and continue humanity's evolution on, and beyond, Earth.

The question still remains however. How we do encourage majic when the rules say it's wrong?

* Note: MajiÄ‡ is my family name. It's egotistical to use it here I know, but I couldn't think of a better word. I'm especially using it for my parents. They've been overworked all their life yet still always cleaned and built stuff for other people with care. I wanted to retire them. Instead, I can name the act by which a regular person improves humanity in their name.

* Sticking it to my personal Darth Blockbuster also makes me smile too.
