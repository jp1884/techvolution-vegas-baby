# The Magic of Evolution

Well, Skywalker, before you go off and face Darth Blockbuster, you have to learn some things. The most important being the all powerful energy field inside every lifeform. No not the Force, but evolution.

Evolution gives every new lifeform a slightly different variation. Variations empower life to test for environmental changes like water levels, temperature, food supply. The variation who can't cut it, slowly die, whole the fittest survive and make more variations. Evolution naturally selects which lifeforms best represent life on Earth.

With evolution, life went from a single-cell organism to millions of species. Because each harnesses resources differently, higher biodiversity means life can better probe and therefore better adapt to environmental changes. If temperatures increase, or rain patterns change, the sooner a lifeform feels the pain of change, the sooner natural selection will adapt to it. Quick adaptions makes like more anti-fragile to disasters.

However, to avoid overconsumption or stupid adaptions, lifeforms needs a caretaker. Thus, nature locked lifeforms inside a system of checks and balances called ecosystems. This way, for example, if the zebra population surges and starts to over graze, the lions check that with more kills. If lions kill zebras for thrills, their wasted calories is balanced out with their disadvantage against other predators. Ecosystems checks and balances is how life protects biodiversity.

Evolution may not be the force, but it's certainly magical. Without any lifeform being aware of its tricks, evolution turned a lifeless planet into life's oasis. The big drawback is time. Biological variations take millions of years to respond to environmental changes. Think of the poor polar bears. They'll never understand why the ice isn't coming. Sadly, evolution doesn't empower them to proactively change their biology.

In contrast, humanity can change (hopefully in time to help the polar bears). Not our biology. But our "cyborgology" if you will. And while evolution maybe magical, creating new tools isn't. It's intentional. We reflect on our problems, create a new tool to overcome our problem.

This way humanity can intentionally evolve. A better form of evolution that isn't a magical mystery, like evolution is to polar bears, but something we can understand. We need a term for intentional evolution with technology. I call it majic.

## The Majic of Techvolution

When a person has a leaky roof, or is sick of scratched DVD's, they're a lifeform struggling to harness resources. When that person doesn't suffer fate, but asseses the problem and creates a new tool to solve it, like metal roofs or internet streaming, they become a protagonist.

Creating new tools is called innovation. We already understand and celebrate innovation. Even Darth Blockbuster can love new tools. Innovating new tools isn't our problem. We need people to actually use them.

That means the extras, the ones suffering the pain of the frontline and probing for solutions, upgrading themselves. Techvolution is a new ruling philosophy to empower extras to naturally select their own tools.

However, the process by which extras decide to drop one tool, and pick up another, needs a term. It's not magic, because extras understand they're swopping out the DVD player for Netlix. Yet it's still quite mystical because no person can be conscious of their connections with all their tools.

So I call it majic. Protagonists innovate, antagonists obstruct, Techvolution allows the unhindered distribution of innovations to the extras, but it's majical when the extras decide if the innovation is better, and intentional evolve humanity. While Darth Blockbuster can claim to be a innovator, he can't claim to be a majician. Majic requries the freedom to chose which tools best solves your problems.

So Skywalker, we can sketch these new rules into our rule book. Humans evolve with tools. We need an ecosystem to keep us in check. The more innovation we have, the more options cyborgs have, the more antifragile humanity can be. Techvolution liberates the extras from old rules, so they can freely decide their tools. But it's the majicical connection between extra and new tool to solve a problem, that continues humanity's evolution on, and beyond, Earth.

* Note: MajiÄ‡ is my family name. It's egotistical to use it here I know, but I couldn't think of a better word. I'm especially using it for my parents. They've been overworked all their life yet still always cleaned and built stuff for other people with care. I wanted to help them retire. Instead, I can name the act by which a regular person improves humanity in their name.

* Sticking it to my personal Darth Blockbuster also makes me smile too.
