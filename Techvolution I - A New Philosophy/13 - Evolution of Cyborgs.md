# The Magic of Evolution

Well young Skywalker, before you go off and face Darth Blockbuster, you have to learn some things. The most important being the all powerful energy field inside every lifeform. No not the Force. I mean evolution.

Evolution empowers life by giving every new lifeform a slightly different variation. This way life can constantly test for environmental changes in things like water levels, temperature, and food supply. The variations unfit for the frontline die off, while the fittest survive. This natural selection is how evolution finds which lifeforms best represent life on Earth.

Evolutions works so well because it creates biodiversity. The more lifeforms there are, the more life can probe and therefore better adapt to environmental changes. When temperatures increase or rain patterns change, high biodiversity means more lifeform feel frontline pain, respond faster, and thereby keep life's evolution going.

If the environment is stable however lifeforms need a caretaker. Someone to keep them in shape, ready to act for when the environment does change. That's why nature put in a system of checks and balances called ecosystems. Inside ecosystems is where lifeforms make communities and cooperate to mimick environmental changes by keeping each other on their toes.

Ecosystems are a food chain of many different plants, herbivores, carinvores, and decomposers. Each lifeforms checks the other's excesses, make sure everyone reciprocates to keep nutrients flowing. Checks and reciprocation is how ecosystems make sure life keeps evolving in good times.

Evolution may not be the Force, but it's certainly magical. Without any lifeform being aware of its tricks, evolution turned a lifeless planet into an oasis. The big drawback is time. Biological variations take millions of years to respond to environmental changes. Think of the poor polar bears. They'll never understand why the ice isn't coming. And even if they could, no lifeform can proactively change their biology.

In contrast, humanity can change (hopefully in time to help the polar bears). Not our biology. But our "cyborgology" if you will, because we feel frontline pain, reflect on the problems causing them, and create a new tool to overcome.

Techvolution is therefore intentional evolution. A better form of evolution that isn't a magical mystery, like evolution is to polar bears, but something we can understand. Question is, what drives us to evolve, when the rules often say it's wrong?

## The Majic of Techvolution

We call it genius when someone uses existing technology to make a new tool. Happily these trailblazers are self-motivated, and we already celebrate their genius and innovations. Heck, even Darth Blockbuster often loves their work. But innovation isn't the only step to Techvolution. Only when the extras use a tool do we evolve.

So what trick does nature play on the extras to use new tools and risk Darth Blockbuster's wrath. Like evolution, the trick lives within all our souls.

Unlike evolution, the trick is not magic, because extras understand they're dropping one tool and attaching another; like swopping out the DVD player for Netlix. Yet, there's still something wonderfully mystical about choosing to leave ones's comfort zone and learn a new cyborgolgy. It's like a desert fox putting on a swimsuit, flippers, goggles, and dive into the ocean yelling "I can do this!".

Changing our tools is so wonderfully brave, mysterious, and difficult, I call it majic. Pronounced like magic, but different so we know it's the free choice of a regular person to upgrade to a new tool and continue humanity's evolution.

Think of majic like a bonding agent. Carbon atoms are sticky and thereby bond other atoms to form the Universe's many molecules. Genius in the protagonists minds bonds existing ideas into an original ones. Good storytelling bonds audiences with different worlds and characters. And majic bonds extras with a new tool. Notably, once Techvolution frees people to choose their own tools, it's the majic of millions of people, that builds our Life Star.

Keep in mind, innovation is not our goal. Spreading new tools to the masses is. Techvolution is the ruling philosophy letting them decide for themselves what tools they need. The question for us young Skywalker, is how we do encourage the extras majical connection with new tools, when today's rules say it's wrong?

* Note: MajiÄ‡ is my family name. It's egotistical to use it here I know, but I couldn't think of a better word. I'm especially using it for my parents. They've been overworked all their life yet still always cleaned and built stuff for other people with care. I wanted to retire them. Instead, I can name the act by which a regular person improves humanity in their name.

* Sticking it to my personal Darth Blockbuster makes me smile too.
