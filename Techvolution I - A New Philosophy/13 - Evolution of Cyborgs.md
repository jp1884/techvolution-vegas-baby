# Evolution of Cyborgs

Well, Skywalker, you need to master the all powerful energy field inside every lifeform. _Star Wars_ calls it the Force. You probably recognize it by its other name, evolution.

Evolution gives every new lifeforms a slightly different variation. This empowers life to test for environmental changes, and since only the fittest survive, evolution empowers life's adaption to new environments. With evolution life reacts to change, but can't anticipate it. Sadly, polar bears can't see the trend of meling ice and start to plan ahead.

Evolution divides life into domains, kingdoms, classes, orders, families, genuses, and species. All lifeforms share a common ancestor, but are related to each differently. With so many lifeforms, life can work together to keep probing, and therefore adapting, to the environment. Lifeforms work together to keep making new lifeforms, by being very effificent with resources. In fact, lifeforms work together in a system of checks and balances inside ecosystems to be sure no lifeforms turn selfish and overconsumes resources and limits life's evolution.

Evolution works like magic. It brought life from a single-cell organism, to a world with billions of lifeforms and millions of species. The only drawback is time. Biological variations take many generations. Polar bears evolved over 11 million years.

Because humanity is aware of time, we want to speed it up. Would you wait for a biological solution to a famine or plague? Me neither. We imagine a better world and thus create our own adaptions (called tools) with technology.

While evolution maybe magical, creating new tools, and teaching people to use them isn't. It's intentional. It means we're experiencing a problem, and solving it ourselves. I call this majic, because we solve problem with our willpower.

Techvolution is empowering human technological evolution by ridding Darth Blockbuster of his power, by empowering extras to decide when society should upgrade our tools. That means Skywalker we must promote the majical creation of new tools.

The more the better, because like biodiversity, the more tools on the frontline, means the more problems we're solving.

In summary Skywalker, humans are cyborgs. The more cyborgs there are, the more anti-fragile life is. Thus our job is to create new tools, and get them into the hands of those who need them.

- lifeform teamwork, checks and balances inside ecosytem
- life needs variations, duplications die.
