# Evolution of Cyborgs

Well, Skywalker here's the first thing to know. The Force exists. It's a real thing you'll learn to harness for the forces of good. No kidding. You probably recognize it by its other name, evolution.

Thing of it. The Force is an all power energy field inside every living thing. Those who harness it increase their powers. Evolution is the same. It's inside every new lifeform, giving us all a unqiue variation. The variations that best harness change, increase their powers.

Of course biological lifeforms themselves don't have a choice. Some camels get slightly bigger humps, some smaller. Each new camel is an unwilling minor variation, and only the fittest survive the environment. But with enough time, evolution divides life into domains, kingdoms, classes, orders, families, genuses, and species. The more lifeforms the better. It means life is solving more problem, and is therefore more anti-fragile to changing environments.

Evolution brought life from a single-cell organism, to us walking on the Moon. The only drawback is time. See biological variations take many generations. Camels alone evolved over 11 million years.

Because humanity is aware of time, we want to speed it up. Would you prefer waiting for a biological solution to a famine or plague? Me neither. We imagine a better world and thus create our own adaptions (called tools) with technology.

While evolution maybe magical, creating new tools, and teaching people to use them isn't. It's intentional. It means we're experiencing a problem, and solving it ourselves. I call this majic, because we solve problem with our willpower.

Techvolution is empowering human technological evolution by ridding Darth Blockbuster of his power, by empowering extras to decide when society should upgrade our tools. That means Skywalker we must promote the majical creation of new tools.

The more the better, because like biodiversity, the more tools on the frontline, means the more problems we're solving.

In summary Skywalker, humans are cyborgs. The more cyborgs there are, the more anti-fragile life is. Thus our job is to create new tools, and get them into the hands of those who need them.
