# The Magic of Evolution

Well young Skywalker, the first step is to defeat Darth Blockbuster. But before you go off and face him, you have to learn some things. The most important being the all powerful energy field inside every lifeform. No not the Force. I mean evolution.

Evolution empowers life by giving every new lifeform a slightly different variation. This way life can constantly test for environmental changes in things like water levels, temperature, and food supply. The variations who can't cut it die off, while the fittest survive. This natural selection is how evolution finds which lifeforms best represent life on Earth.

Evolutions works so well because it creates biodiversity. With more lifeforms life can better probe and therefore better adapt to environmental changes. When temperatures increase or rain patterns change, high biodiversity means more lifeform feel the pain, respond faster, and thereby keep life's evolution going.

If the environment is stable however, lifeforms need a caretaker. Someone to keep them in shape, ready to act for when the environment does change. That's why nature put in a system of checks and balances called ecosystems. Ecosystems are a closed off food chain of plants, herbivores, carinvores, and decomposers. Each checks the othoer's excesses, to keep the flow or nutrients flowing. Because each lifeform is accountable for their actions, while having to reciprocate to earn their calories, inside ecosystems is where lifeform cooperate. Only together can they use resources efficiently, making sure life evolves even in good times.

Evolution may not be the Force, but it's certainly magical. Without any lifeform being aware of its tricks, evolution turned a lifeless planet into an oasis. The big drawback is time. Biological variations take millions of years to respond to environmental changes. Think of the poor polar bears. They'll never understand why the ice isn't coming. And even if they could, no lifeform can proactively change their biology.

In contrast, humanity can change (hopefully in time to help the polar bears). Not our biology. But our "cyborgology" if you will, because we reflect on our problems and create a new tool to overcome it.

Techvolution is therefore intentional evolution. A better form of evolution that isn't a magical mystery, like evolution is to polar bears, but something we can understand. Question is, what drives us to evolve, when the rules often say it's wrong?

## The Majic of Techvolution

We call it genius when someone assembles existing technology to make a new tool. Happily these trailblazers are self-motivated, and we already celebrate their genius and innovations. Heck, even Darth Blockbuster often loves new tools. But innovation isn't the only step to Techvolution. Only when the extras use a tool do we evolve.

So what trick does nature play on the extras to use new tools and risk Darth Blockbuster's wrath. Like evolution, the trick lives within all our souls. Only human actions holds it back.

Unlike evolution, the trick is not magic, because extras understand they're dropping one tool and putting in another; like swopping out the DVD player for Netlix. Yet, there's still something wonderfully mystical about choosing to leave ones's comfort zone and learn to be a new cyborg. It's like a desert fox putting on a swimsuit and flippers, jump into the ocean, while saying "I can do this!".

Changing our tools is so wonderfully brave, mysterious, and difficult, I call it majic. Pronounced like magic, but different so we know it's the free choice of a regular person to use a new tool and continue humanity's evolution.

Think of it like different bonding agents. Carbon atoms bond other atoms to form molecules. Genius in the protagonists minds bonds existing ideas into a new tool. And its majic when extras bond with a new tool. It's unobstructed, free, majic that will build our Lifestar.

Keep in mind, innovation is not our goal. Spreading new tools to the masses it. Techvolution is the ruling philosophy letting them decide for themselves what tools they need. The question for us young Skywalker, is how we do encourage the extras majical connection with new tools, when today's rules say it's wrong?

* Note: MajiÄ‡ is my family name. It's egotistical to use it here I know, but I couldn't think of a better word. I'm especially sticking with it for my parents. They've been overworked all their life yet still always cleaned and built stuff for other people with care. I wanted to retire them. Instead, I can name the act by which a regular person improves humanity in their name.

* Sticking it to my personal Darth Blockbuster makes me smile too.
