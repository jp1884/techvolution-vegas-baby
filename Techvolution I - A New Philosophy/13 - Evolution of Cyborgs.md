# The Magic of Evolution

Well young Skywalker, before you go off and face Darth Blockbuster, you have to learn some things first. The most important being the all powerful energy field inside every lifeform. No not the Force. I mean evolution.

Evolution empowers life by giving every new lifeform a slightly different variation. This way life can constantly tests for environmental changes in water levels, temperature, food supply, etc. The variations who can't cut it slowly die, while the fittest survive. That's how evolution naturally selects which lifeforms best represent life on Earth.

Evolutions works so well because it creates biodiversity. More lifeforms means life can better probe and therefore better adapt to environmental changes. When temperatures increase or rain patterns change, high biodiversity means more lifeform feel the pain, start life's evolution.

Evolution may not be the Force, but it's certainly magical. Without any lifeform being aware of its tricks, evolution turned a lifeless planet into its oasis. The big drawback is time. Biological variations take millions of years to respond to environmental changes. Think of the poor polar bears. They'll never understand why the ice isn't coming. And even if they could, no lifeform can proactively change their biology.

In contrast, humanity can change (hopefully in time to help the polar bears). Not our biology. But our "cyborgology" if you will, because we reflect on our problems and create a new tool to overcome it.

Techvolution is therefore intentional evolution. A better form of evolution that isn't a magical mystery, like evolution is to polar bears, but something we can understand. Question is, what drives us to evolve, when the rules often say it's wrong?

## The Majic of Techvolution

Creating new tools is called innovation. Happily trailblazers are self-motivated, and we already celebrate their innovations. Heck, even Darth Blockbuster often loves new tools. But innovation isn't the only step to Techvolution. Only when the extras use a tool, do we evolve.

So what trick does nature play on the extras to make them use new tools.

First off, the process by which extras decide to drop one tool, and pick up another, needs a term. It's not the magic of evolution, because extras understand they're swopping out the DVD player for Netlix. Yet, there's still something wonderfully mystical about choosing to leave ones's comfort zone, throw away an old tool, and learn a one. It's like a hungry desert fox leaving for the jungle and saying "I'll figure it all out when I get there".

It's so wonderfully brave, mysterious, and difficult, I call it majic. Pronounced like magic, but different so we know it's the free choice of a regular person to use a new tool and continue humanity's evolution.

The question for us young Skywalker, is how we do encourage majic when the rules say it's wrong?

* Note: MajiÄ‡ is my family name. It's egotistical to use it here I know, but I couldn't think of a better word. I'm especially using it for my parents. They've been overworked all their life yet still always cleaned and built stuff for other people with care. I wanted to retire them. Instead, I can name the act by which a regular person improves humanity in their name.

* Sticking it to my personal Darth Blockbuster makes me smile too.
