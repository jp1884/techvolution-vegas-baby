# The Magic of Evolution

Well, Skywalker, you need to step up. But before you go off and face Darth Blockbuster, you have to learn the  force. The all powerful energy field inside every lifeform. You probably know it by it's other name, evolution.

Evolution gives every new lifeform a slightly different variation. Variations empower life to test for environmental changes by only letting the fittest survive. Evolution is how life naturally selects which lifeforms best represent life on Earth.

With evolution, life went from a single-cell organism to millions of species. Because each harnesses resources differently, higher biodiversity means life can better probe and therefore better adapt to changing environments, and become more anti-fragile to disasters.

However, to avoid overconsumption or stupid adaptions, lifeforms needs a caretaker. Thus, nature locked lifeforms inside system of checks and balances called ecosystems. This way, for example, if the zebra population surges and starts to over graze, the lions check that with more kills. If lions kill zebras for jokes, their waste is balanced out with wasted calories and the jokesters die off. Ecosystems are how life protects biodiversity.

Evolution may not be the force, but it's certainly magical. Without any lifeform being aware of its tricks, evolution turns a rock into an life's oasis. The big drawback is time. Biological variations take millions of years to respond to environmental changes. Think of the poor polar bears. They'll never understand why the ice isn't coming. Sadly, evolution doesn't empower them to proactively change their biology.

In contrast, humanity can change. Not our biology. But our "cyborgology" if you will. And while evolution maybe magical, creating new tools isn't. It's intentional. We reflect on our problems, and adapt our cyborgology to solve them.

Humanity can intentionally evolve. I better form of evolution that isn't a magical mystery, like evolution is to polar bears, but something we can master. We need a term for intentional evolution with technology. I call it majic.

## The Majic of Techvolution

When a person has a leaky roof, or is sick of scratched DVD's, they're a lifeform struggling to harness resources. When that person doesn't suffer fate, but asseses the problem and creates a new tool, like metal roofs or internet streaming, to solve it, they become a protagonist.

Creating new tools is called innovation. We already understand and celebrate innovation. Even Darth Blockbuster calls himself an innovator. But innovating a new tool isn't our goal. We need people to use them.

Neither protagonists or Darth Blockbuster should decide which innovations society adopts. Only the extras should. Only they feel the pain of the frontlin, and can unbiasly decide which tools best solves it. Techvolution is a new ruling philosophy to empowers them to naturally select their own tools.

Extras deciding to drop one tool, and pick up another, needs a term. It needs to be mystical. Because like lifeforms, extras don't really understand their own pain. But its not magic, because extras still understand they're discarding a DVD player and attaching ourselves to Netflix.

I called extras deciding to change their cyborgology majic. Pronounced the same, it's the intentional process by which extras decide what tools they should hold to complete their cyborg selves. Majic completes innovation.

As I said before. This book isn't about helping protagonists innovate. It's about getting innovations into the real world. Now we have a term for that, majic. Majic is what Darth Blockbuster hates. But while he can hide behind rules, and even claim to be an innovator, will Darth Blockbuster ever call himself a majician? He can't. Majic is the freedom to chose one's own tools. It's a term made to defeat Darth Blockbuster.

So Skywalker, we can sketch these new rules into our rule book. Humans evolve with tools. We need an ecosystem to keep us in check. The more innovation we have, the more options cyborgs have, the more antifragile humanity can be. Techvolution liberates the extras from old rules, so they can freely decide their tools. But it's the majicical connection between extra and new tool to solve a problem, that continues humanity's evolution on, and beyond, Earth.

* Note: MajiÄ‡ is my family name. It's kinda egotistical to use it here I know, but I couldn't think of a better word. I'm especially using it for my parents. They've been overworked all their life yet still always cleaned and built stuff with care, even though Darth Blockbuster usually micro managed and underpaid them. I wanted to help them retire. Instead, I can name the act by which an extra purposefully evolves humanity in their name.

* Sticking it to my personal Darth Blockbuster also makes me smile too.
