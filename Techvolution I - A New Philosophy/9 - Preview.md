## Mixed Ideological Politics

>I thought you guys would like to hear this story. I know my fellow wrestlers know exactly what I'm talking about. A martial art is either real or it's not. Very early on in the sport of mixed-martial arts, when the logical assumption from the marketing team is that you're going to get every taekwondo student, every karate student, every judo practitioner, and every aikido and they're just going to absolutely love mixed-martial arts.

>It ended up being the absolute opposite.

>All of those arts that I just named that, turned out to not be real, or at least real in terms of their effectiveness in actual combat, steered as far away from mixed-martial arts as they could. They begged their students not to watch. Found a number of different reasons why mixed-martial arts is too violent or too, whatever their excuse was.

>Because the practioners of old martial arts didn't like what they were finding out. They had bought into it. They had spent their life. They had mastered some of these old martial arts movements. To only find out that it was a waste of time.

Are you sick of today's politics? The ranting and raving. The endless half-truths and memes that only serve to entrench already held beliefs. This books feels your pain. It's geared to the moderate middle who want politics to be about rational problem-solving instead of entertaining mudslinging.

Solving pain is what this book is all about.

To fight pain we humans develop things. We change government policies to direct our resources in better ways. We invent tools to solve our problems with lasting solutions. And, we learn new ideas to expand our minds.

Whatever we develop, we do it to solve our pain.

Martial arts is a great example of this quest. Karate, kickboxing, taekwondo, wrestling, aikido, jiu-jitsu, judo, and boxing are our most popular self-defense disciplines. Each of them teach a set of techniques to subdue an opponent. When fighting each discipline creates rules that say only their techniques are allowed; there's no kicking in a boxing match for example.

The world's martial arts co-existed for many years. Inside the disciplines, teachers happily taught their chosen techniques to the next generation. Practioners would train almost everyday. The best students would compete in tournaments, get scholarships, and strive to become world champions. And, believers of a martial art would congregate around experts, tournaments, and the latest news.

But never would these martial arts fight across disciplines.

However, in the late 1980s, as home televisions spread information across the world, once isolated fighting cultures started to open up. People got curious. Fighters started to ask themselves, "which martial art is best?"

Would a boxer beat a kickboxer? What would happen if a wrestler fought a karate guy? Many people starting ask what if martial artists threw away the rule books and fought a real fight.

In the early 1990s, the questions stopped, and the fighting started. At first called Vale Tudo, then Ultimate Fighting, martial artists from every discipline fought in fights with no rules. Finally, the world's fighting masters could prove their martial art was the best on Earth!

And the winner of the best martial art was...

All of them are.

And none of them. 

This revelation surprised everyone. The martial arts community assumed one discipline would reign supreme. But that wasn't the case because each discipline had a limited toolbox of techniques. Sometimes those techniques were very effective in a real fight; like some Brazilian jit jitsu's submissions, or wrestling's dominate control. But many techniques like karate's katas, taekwondo's flashy high-kicks, boxing's obesssion with standing toe-to-toe and swinging for a knockout were easily countered and therefore not effective.

After several years of fighting no rules martial arts tournaments it became clear that some martial art disciplines were more effective than others, but each had drawbacks and none was complete. As Ultimate Fighting kept on growing in popularity during the 1990s and 2000s, it forced the martial art communities to reflect on their techniques and beliefs.

As said in the opening quote, many practioners, referees, coaches, and pundits (especially from the least effective disciplines) choose to retreat back into their sub-cultures because they, "didn't like what they were finding out."

Fortunately, many fighters embraced the effectual truth revealed by Ultimate Fighting. And so, the world of martial arts started to get all mixed up.

Some kickboxers started to train submissions. Wrestlers learned some punching. Masters in one discipline started as eager newbies in another. Eventually, after several years of watching, learning, and participating in the cross-pollination of techniques, these fighters evolved skills far beyond their old martial arts teachers and disciplines.

Listening to their physical pain of failure with a newly open mind, martial artists adopted evolution's philosophy of "adapt or die." Human self-defense finally learned what every lifeform on Earth knows; there is no rulebook.

No deer in the world depends on a judge to save it when fighting off a bear, as no bear depends on a pundit declaring it the winner to get its next meal.

Just like in Nature, the best martial art technique is entirely dependant on ones's opponent and surroundings while measuring the risks and rewards of the fight. Whatever techniques are most efficient to win the fight are the best.

Before Ultimate Fighting, all fighters were puting the horse before the cart, so to speak. They had the answers before knowing the problem. Martial arts students were tricked into thinking fights are won or lost according to man-made rules governeed by teachers, pundits, and judges instead of real-world results. 

Despite sometimes getting beaten black and blue, martial artists were never stupid. Their fault is quite human; they fell prey to good storytelling. 

Quality storytelling is why so many devoted boxers, judokas, and other practioners were so easily misled by their respective discipline. Filled with history, culture, traditions isolated martial art disciplines acted like echo chambers with a reality so complete, it tricked people into believing it was the single source of truth.

Once martial artists opened their minds, they started fighting for themselves. Fighters quickly realized the rules of boxing, kickboxing, wrestling, etc., were excellent for honing their chosen techniques but were also artificial and must be forgotten when preparing for an actual fight.

Thereafter evolution became martial artists instructor and the community entered a brave new world. 

A world of remarkable progress. With an open mind and access to the world's information on the internet, fighters improved themselves by leaps and bounds every year. Kickboxers became wrestlers, Jiu-jitsu black belts learned high-kicks. The individual disciplines brought their techniques to an open marketplace of ideas.

With evolution as their teacher, these new martial artists started to listen to their bodies instead of other peoples stories. The speed of victories, and the less pain suffered in winning them, was the best judge, teacher, and pundit of what's the best fighting philosophy. The top martial arts trainers were the ones who helped their students adapt faster.

This new evolutionary fighting philosophy was so successful it created a new way for humans to think of self-defense called mixed-martial arts.

In mixed-martial arts, fighters don't limit themselves within the confines of an artificial rulebook. Everyone should learn a little from every discipline. The best technique is the one that brings results. So devoted to evolution, mixed-martial artists want everyone to improve because, "iron sharpens iron".

Mixing the human body's adaptability with a free mind created a new, self-correcting, and sustainable martial art. Today, even a moderately skilled mixed-martial artist is an overwhelming favorite against a champion of any single fighting discipline. Just as important, since mixed-martial arts includes all techniques, any person, whether short or tall, heavy or thin, aggressive or meek, can find their niche and learn to win a fight. 

And finding a niche is what evolution is all about. By empowering anyone and everyone, mixed-martial arts is the ultimate fighting philosophy.

On our journey to improve our politics, here's the lessons we should take from the story of mixed-martial arts.

Today, in the early 21st century, the middle-class has many systematic problems. Taxes get more confusing. School prepares students less for the job market. Insurance gets more expensive. And there are many more topics trending badly.

We all want better for ourselves and our kids. So we turn to politics to make it happen. The worst things get, the more political people become. Politics to us means a single ideology of "red", "blue", "green" and so on. We back one of these by donating time and money, buying books, following pundits, giving our loyalty, and...

We keep getting our asses kicked in our real lives.

Like old martial artists who believed their chosen discipline was the single source of truth, the middle-class keeps losing because we believe in _one_ ideology and wrongfully think our lives are governed by its rulebook.

And now our politics is trending badly. Because as our economy keeps getting worse, the more people buy into one ideology's storytelling. We're stuck in a self-reinforcing spiral. It's easy to because many teachers, pundits, commentators are selling us their books, lectures, podcasts and creating a neatly packed reality. But it's an artificial reality, because each ideology is like old martial arts masters telling us stories how their techniques give automatic success before assessing our specific situations.

And when we continue to feel the pain of real life problems, we're told the other disciplines are not options because they break the ideological rulebook. Or even worse, we're told we must attack other ideologies because the failing economy is _their_ fault.

The truth is, all political ideologies and their economic plans are incomplete.

That's why I wrote _Techvolution_. It helps break any steadfast loyalty you have one ideology and encourages you to realize you're a lifeform in Nature, and thus the only rules and techniques that matter are those that help you reliably solve your specific and unique everyday problems.

Nature is a street fight, and evolution is the only teacher you need. Whatever solves your pain is the single source of truth.

With this freedom of mind to mix and match ideologies you'll overcome any political or economic problem. Be it a dreadful morning commute, rising climate change, or debilitating government bureaucracy. This new philosophy might be called mixed-ideological politics.

Seeing through today's onslaught of Twitter feeds, cable news, dinner table arguments will be hard. Like old martial arts, there are lots of ideologues weaving tales of their techniques infallibility. To see above today's political noise and salesmanship requires a solid understanding of storytelling. One you got that, you'll avoid being sucked into the false security of ideological echo chambers.

Once you're protected from ideological stortelling, you can adopt mixed-ideological politics. After reading this book, you'll be as powerful in your politics as a mixed-martial artist is in a fight.

## Echo Chambers Are Needed, Until They're Not

- Remember we're not erasing ideologies.

It would be nice if humanity created mixed-martial arts first. Spending hundreds of years developing many martial arts techniques where most ultimately proved ineffective seems like a waste. But starting off with mixed-martial arts wasn't possible.

We had to invent lots of options in order to select the best. Only ignorant people think great results don't require lots of wasted effort. Every hit product starts off with a poor first try. Every great book has hundreds of erased pages.

By the same token, to invent martial art techniques needed lots of wasted effort. So while boxing alone isn't too effective againt a trained mixed-martial artist, for humanity to learn excellent punching techniques required we create boxing. Same applies to judo and its bodythrows, jiu-jitsu and its submissions, and so on for every discipline. Being stuck inside an echo chamber enforced by a strict rulebook allowed the practioners inside a martial art to iterate and perfect their selected techniques.

The obstacle mixed-martial arts had to overcome wasn't the rulebooks of martial arts disciplines, but their proclamations about being the single source of truth.

By thinking they had the monopoly on truth, old martial arts had the solution before hearing the problem. Such ignorance is sadly the drawback of having to grow disciplines inside of echo chambers. When those disciplines are exposed to competition, it's natural for those inside to advocate for their skillset. It's also natural to resist realizing those skills are outdated; starting all over is a hard reality for anyone to accept.

The achievement of mixed-martial arts is banishing ignorance from martial arts and replacing it with enlightenment. Anyone who chooses mixed-martial arts knows there are no easy answers because real fights have endless possibilities.

Thus, it's vital to remember there is nothing wrong with all but the extremist of today's ideologies. This book is not trying to erase your preferred ideology anymore than a mixed-martial artist wants to erase boxing. Every sub-culture has something to offer. But none can consider their techniques the single source of truth. Each ideology must be mixed and matched as needed by the problem being solved.

Some may be doubting our politics can follow martial arts and embrace mixed-ideological politics, here's another example of a field adopting a similarly enlighted philosophy.

Modern medicine has many disciplines and specialists. Some are based on cutting edge research, others on old school remedies. In the past, when isolated by geography and culture, people would be bound to do what the local healer or doctor prescribed. But today, you would never go to one medical professional, expecting them to be a master of every possible health problem.

There's simply too many human health problems for any one medical discipline to master.

That's why all medical professionals today, from hemopathic healers to neural surgeons, are recognized as sub-disciplines. Each has their own techniques, cultures, and rulebooks, and none say they are the single source of truth. The skill in modern medicine is mixing disciplines to solve a patients pain. While modern medicine certainly isn't perfect (especially its administration), compared to the past medicine filled with leeches, witchcraft, and one-size fits all solutions, its nearly magical. Modern medicine and mixed-martial arts are enlightened because they free their practioners minds to assess the problem before deciding on the best technique.

That book does the same for ideology.

If a person can train using different fighting techniques from many multiple martial arts disciplines, and doctors can refer their patients to specialists from other disciplines, why can't we also be self-aware enough, and respectful enough, to mix and match ideologies according to their strengths and weaknesses in solving a specific problem?

To enlighten our politics in such a way, we only have to accept no ideology is complete. Like in medicine or Ultimate Fighting, any ideological technique must be evaluated based on evidence of their real-world results and not ideological purity.

Ideological pundits, teachers, and commentators don't want the open competition of evolution. Like the stubborn martial artists who convined their students to never watch mixed-martial arts, ideologues today want to defend there skillsets from natural selection by keeping their echo chambers engaged with great (ideological) storytelling.

To escape their spell, we must understand the magic of storytelling.

## Cinderella

- how to see through echo chambers so we can mix and match them.

The classic fairytale _Cinderella_ a great example of how to hook an audience.

The movie Cinderella tells the story of a beautiful, diligent, and kind-hearted country girl who lives with her cruel step family. She is forced to do all the chores and serve her wicked stepmother and her two spoiled stepsisters. She's made friends with the local animals, but dreams of a better life and a chance to find happiness.

She’s ecstatic when she learns that the King is holding a grand celebration to find a bride for his charming son. Cinderella sews her own dress while anticipating the most wonderful night of her life. But her evil family forbids her and tears her dress to shreds.

The young country girl is on the verge of tears. But just as despair is about to set in, her fairy godmother appears. With a flick of her wand, she transforms Cinderella’s ragged clothes into a dazzling gown and a pair of sparkling glass slippers. She also magically creates a carriage and a team of horses so that her goddaughter will have a night she’ll never forget.

At the party, Cinderella captivates everyone with her beauty and grace, especially the Prince. They glide across the floor and whisper sweet nothings in each other’s ears. Sadly, the spell that gave Cinderella her magical night soon ends, forcing the shy country girl to flee from the ballroom, leaving the Prince with nothing but a glass slipper to remember her by.

The heartbroken Prince is determined to find his true love and orders his men to search the entire kingdom for the girl who can wear the slipper.

They eventually get to Cinderella’s house. Sadly, the wicked stepmother has gotten wise that her stepdaughter is the Prince’s heartthrob, and so locks her in the attic. The attack doesn't go unnoticed, because Cinderella's animal friends come to the rescue and steal the key. They get the attic door open in time for Cinderella to ask the Prince’s men if she can try on the glass slipper. Then, just as she’s about to, the evil stepmother smashes the precious mememto.

To which Cinderella responds by revealing she has the other slipper.

And the rest is history.

The movie _Cinderella_ was very popular when it was released. It's popular today. And it'll be popular hundreds of years from now when humanity is (hopefully) travelling the stars. People will always like it because everyone can sympathzie with a well meaning person overcoming obstacles and bullies, to improve their lives.

People love stories. We can't get enough of them. A good story lets us experience the trials, lessons, and drama of another person. From horrible brushes with death, to whimsical romances, stories let us experience many lives within our own time on Earth.

Stories are so powerful because they create a virtual reality. This starts with the props that fill the storyworld with items, from beds to cups, we expect to see. There is music to relay the emotions of characters in the story. The dialogue of the story communicates what each character wants in a easy to understand way. Then there's the villain who earns their name because he likesthe  world the way it is and defends it against change. Next comes the philosophy of the story world. The philosophy dictates the rules everyone in the story is supposed to live by, for example Cinderella is supposed to obey her stepmother; of course she does not. By disrearding the ruling philosphy and envisioning a better world, Cinderella defines what a hero is. And at the top of this story pyramid is the tools; a catchall term for the real objects and levers of power that determine who controls what happens in the story world.

The magic of good storytelling is mixing these incredients together. When done properly, the resulting cake will transfix audiences and have them absorb the story like it really happened to them. A good stories are revealed by how much the make their audience jump, scream, cry while watching what is in reality, make believe.

---

And that brings us back to echo chambers and our desire need to escape ideological ones.

Dismantling echo chambers starts by realizing the story of _Cinderella_ isn't about a girl controlled by her evil step-family. The classic fairytale is also not about a girl overcoming her evil step-family to marry her prince charming.

The story of _Cinderella_ is about a girl overcoming her step-family using levers of powers, i.e. tools.

If Cinderella doesn't get the horses, carriage, and evening dress from her fairy godmother, she'll never get into the ball. If the Prince didn't find her lost slipper, she'd never see him again. If the imprisoned country girl's allies didn't steal the key to the attic, she'd never get out in time. And if Cinderella didn't have the second glass slipper, her name would be famous as a tragedy instead of a fairytale.

Cinderella had a problem, and it wasn't that her step-family were terrible people, it was that her terrible step-family controlled important tools and Cinderella didn't.

The drama of the story is the battle over tools. From the tickets to the royal ball, to the famous glass slipper, _Cinderella_ is a battle over real objects because only real objects can forcibly change the world. It's often assumed heroes are made by speaking up against an injustice. However, taking a stance against evil is how heroes start. But it's with tools that heroes change the world.

Cinderella becomes a hero when she decides to disregard the rules of her stepfamily. She defeats her enemies and changes her fortunes because she wont the battle over tools.

Tools are the lever of power in every story. From _Star Wars_ to _The Matrix_, the villians control the tools and uss the ruling philosophy to justify their control. The hero suffers an injustice that lets them see a problem with the ruling philosophy. The drama of the story ensues as heroe and villains battle to control the tools. The winners implement their own philsophy, and can change the world in their image. 

If you were to draw our Cinderlla, this is what it looks like.

- Starting Reality - Cinderella is an orphane living with a hateful stepfamily.
- Hero insight - Cinderella decides to disobey her cruel stepmother and attend the ball.
- Back and forth drama - Stepmother and Cinderella and their respective friends, battle to control evening ware, invitations, attic keys and glass slippers.
- New reality - The winner, Cinderella, marries her prince charming and becomes a princess.

The important thing to remember is that in every story, philosophies are representations of tools. Tools themselves are soulless of course. But how they are applied is not. The second most important thing to learn is that once a story ends, the hero is no longer the main character.

And these are the truths those who sell their philosophy as being the eternal single source of truth don't like.

## Each Tool Has Its Own Philosophy

- echo chambers change with tools, so we automatically mix and match them when we change tools.

Story's power comes from the fact they represent reality so seemlessly. With all the incredients properly portioned, fiction can thus stir our emotions. However, but the same token everything in a story has representation in reality. And we can thus learn from stories how our reality works.

We're already discussed how each martial art has specific techniques. Boxing has punching, wrestling man-control, jiu-jitsu has submissions, and so on. Each of these techniques adapt the human body to perform a task. And in that way martial arts turn the human body into a different tool.

As we just learned, each tool has a philosophy behind it.

Boxing is about aggresive hitting, punching combinations, and footwork. Jiu-jitsu is about patience, durability, and seizing openings. Wrestling is hard training with endless reptitions. These are the philsophies needed to hardness the respective techniques of each sport.

- Yoga has a different philosophy than weight training. Ballet different than long distance running.

The tools we use determine the philosophy we believe in. This is why old martial arts were so scared of mixed-martial arts. By allowing any technique, mixed-martial arts disabled any possibilility of having an eternal philosophy. And if you sell philosophy instead of real-world results, that's going to hurt your sales numbers.

Like mixed-martial arts and modern medicine, good stories also freely to mix and match tools.

For example, think of Cinderella locked inside that attic. The prince's men are so close, and if she can just get outside and try on the glass slipper her horrible life will change forever; if her friends can get the key.

Whatif they'd failed getting the key, and instead brough back a match?

Now the oppressed girl has some soul searching to do. The philsophy behind buring the house down, even to earn her freedom, is a different philosophy then getting some friends to steal a key.

The beauty of mixed-martial arts, modern medicine, and any field that selects its techniques, tools, applications based on the problem, is they are like a hero in a good story. Always free to use any tool to solve the problem at hand.

To recognize an ideologue and echo chamber, simply to ask their storytellers to change the tool. They won't be able to do it. They sell and earn their money, prestiage, on knowing a limited set of techniques and tools; be it government run social programs or corporate welfare. To let the problem determine the best solution is to threaten their self-image of being leaders.

Regardless. You can leave an echo chamber, by simply being a hero of your own story.

Be like Cinderella, decide to fight back agaisnt an injustice and find allies to help you seize the tools you need to change the world. 

## Evolution

- changing techniques/tools is evolution. changing tools is technological evolution.

So, this introduction was a lot longer than I wanted it to be. Hopefully its been worth it to get to this point.

I only needed to write so much because of one hard truth we don't yet know.

Mixed-martial arts is training to adapt the human body to perform different fighting techniques. Modern medicine is using technology to educate people to use tools uncover the causes of pain and rememdy it using the tools of a variety of different disciplines.

These human endeavors are enlightened because they disregarded human rules when they get in the way of solving problems. And in the real world and the story world, we solve problems with tools/techniques and other adaptions that can physical alter the world.

And this is how evolution works too. Life continuosly makes new species, it's the most practical ones that survive. Human evolution mimicks natural evolution. Except we do not evolve biologically as animals do. A blue whale will never fly and a monkey will never swin. Humans adapt using tools. The idiots who think humans have enough genetic diversity to explain our differences are all dead or dying. They all fell in the face of technological progress because evolution wait for no one.

Thus,... Human beings must go from creation. To selection. The first step is where echo chambers form. The second step is when we praise

But unlike Nature, we can select our own options. Once we have an enlightenment philosophy to transition people from being loyal members of a discipline, to selecting from these options based on their effectiveness in solving a problem.
