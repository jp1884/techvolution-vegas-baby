_Here is where political philosophy enters. Most people don't reason well, but they do reason—and political philosophy starts from that fact. In America today, Progressives argue that wealth is unjustly distributed, for example, but they overlook the need to generate wealth. Conservatives do the reverse; preoccupied with wealth generation, they pay little attention to how it should be distributed._

_A partisan difference like this one is not a clash of “values,” with each side blind to the other and with no way to decide between them. A competent judge could ask both sides why they omit what they do, and he could supply reasons even if the parties could not. Such a judge is on the way toward political philosophy._

Harvey C. Mansfield, _A Student's Guide to Political Philosophy_

The following chapter explains the principles behind the book _Techvolution_. It summarizies the more detailed work in [_Story Cut Tools_](https://storycuttools.netlify.app/). That's a good read, but this summary has enough meat to guide those who want to jump into the unknown of a new political philosophy.

Technically speaking, this summary uses Aristotle's _Poetics_ to better understand Hegelian dialectics to showcase how humanity continues Life's Darwinian evolution via technological innovation. But that's a mouthful, so it's easier to say this chapter teaches storytelling to explain that your society, workplace, and everyday events are best understood as among the many tales in the long and ongoing evolution of Life.

With the power of storytelling in hand, you'll appreciate why we need a new philosophy in the world. There's no way to fix the social, environmental, and economic problems causing so much hate between Conservatives and Progressives without a new perspective.

Only a new philosophy wipes away the old stories that ideologies fight over today and reminds people that we are creatures in Nature. Like it does for all species, Life demands we evolve to overcome our current problems using new adaptations. We can either evolve proactively under the direction of a new way of thinking, or after many depressions, wars, revolutions, and other disasters gradually teach us the lessons reason wasn't able to.

## Inner Flap

As you read this, a Jaguar is stalking a cayman, an ant colony is raiding its neighbor, an albatross is diving into the Antarctic Ocean, and trillions more lifeforms are battling for survival.

Living in the wild is tough, but many creatures struggle extra hard today. The environment is changing very fast. Among other things, forests, greenfields, and ice caps are disappearing. That means lifeforms such as the polar bear have increasingly unhelpful adaptations. They still have Life's burning desire to survive and procreate, but their form of white coat, colossal bulk, and love of flesh is losing its once mighty advantage to kill seals in the pack ice.

What would you tell a polar bear today if you could communicate with her?

Wouldn't it be nice to explain evolution and describe how our characteristics are the expressions of genes, which are passed on from parent to offspring during reproduction. Thus, Life on Earth is like a race. The organisms that harvest the most calories the fastest, while suffering the least pain, pass on their genes. Over time this turnover of genes slowly evolves the forms of Life to better use the environment's resources.

If the hungry polar bear understood evolution, she would understand her place in the ongoing story of Life. She could assess what characteristics polar bears need to survive in the Artic's new environment. Perhaps male polar bears should help raise and protect their cubs. Or females should hibernate longer. What if polar bears hunted in packs to kill reindeer in the summer months? Whatever new form evolution will eventually find, if polar bears knew about evolution, they could work towards it instead of being molded by it.

At least by understanding how evolution works, polar bears wouldn't feel so frustrated as they walk or swim in circles, struggling to find food.

We know so much about polar bears because palenotoligists, biologists, zoologies, and other specialists have mapped millions of species habits, linages, and physiologies. This knowledge lets them inform humanity about the history, status, and future of many creatures including the majestic bears of the north.

Here's a question, do we know our fate like we know the polar bears? 

Given how much anger, angst, and confusion we have in our politics, the answer is we don't.

This book will teach you about our evolution. The answer is the same for us as for all creatures. The environment is constantly changing. Thus, your form is almost always behind the times, and Life is looking for someone with updated adaptations to better harvest resources and procreate.

We think we understand that, but all the marches, protests, and other outbursts of frustration shows we don't. This book will teach you about human evolution. Because animals (sadly) can't change their genes, they must endure the pain evolution needs to find the species best suited to the environment.

We can change our fate; if we update our characteristics by harnessing modern technology. If you keep reading, you will learn how to evolve humanity and upgrade Life on Earth.

## Mixed-Ideological Politics

>I thought you guys would like to hear this story. I know my fellow wrestlers know exactly what I'm talking about. A martial art is either real or it's not. Very early on in the sport of mixed-martial arts, when the logical assumption from the marketing team is that you're going to get every taekwondo student, every karate student, every judo practitioner, and every aikido and they're just going to absolutely love mixed-martial arts.

>It ended up being the absolute opposite.

>All of those arts that I just named that, turned out to not be real, or at least real in terms of their effectiveness in actual combat, steered as far away from mixed-martial arts as they could. They begged their students not to watch. Found a number of different reasons why mixed-martial arts is too violent or too, whatever their excuse was.

>Because the practioners of old martial arts didn't like what they were finding out. They had bought into it. They had spent their life. They had mastered some of these old martial arts movements. To only find out that it was a waste of time.

Do you think today's politics is healthy? In its highest form, politics is a discussion abour what's the best direction our society should take. Individuals give their opinions, offer their perspective, and exchange ideas. Should our society invest in a new dock or a new road? Should we go to war with an enemy or compromise and make peace? Should we welcome newcomers or shoo them away? Politics is like a nervous system directing resources to cure the pain society feels. 

But, politics isn't always so rational.

Cells in the human body are constantly fighting over resources and we, the people who make up the "body politic" of society, are quite similar. If you only think of politics as the daily experience of ranting, half-truths, and memes, it's because we are arguing for resources, and people don't want to be left out.

The purpose of a political philosophy is to create a shared vision among society. Only when the body politics works together can we create a healthy ecosystem where anyone can better themselves. The lesson of this new political philosophy is we think ideological arguments determine what's good or bad politics, but in fact its evolution that decides.

So, while the the polar bear is doomed to suffer pain for many more years, this book is about solving your pain to ease humanity's evolution.

To fight pain we humans develop things. We try to change our "genes" so to speak. We change government policies to direct our resources in better ways. We invent tools to solve our problems with lasting solutions. And, we learn new ideas to expand our minds. Whatever we develop, we do it to solve our pain.

Martial arts is a great example.

Karate, kickboxing, taekwondo, wrestling, aikido, jiu-jitsu, judo, and boxing are our most popular self-defense disciplines. To subdue an opponent each of them teach a set of techniques. During training and matches each discpline creates rules that say only their techniques are allowed; there's no kicking in a boxing match for example.

The world's martial arts co-existed for many years. Inside the disciplines, teachers happily taught their techniques to the next generation. Practioners would train almost everyday. The best students would compete in tournaments, get scholarships, and strive to become world champions. And, believers of a martial art would congregate around experts, tournaments, and the latest news.

But never would these martial arts fight across disciplines.

However, in the late 1980s, as home televisions spread information across the world, once isolated fighting cultures started to open up. People got curious. Fighters started to ask themselves, "which martial art is best?"

Would a boxer beat a kickboxer? What would happen if a wrestler fought a karate guy? Many people wanted to know what if martial artists threw away the rule books and fought a real fight.

In the early 1990s, the questions stopped, and the fighting started. At first called Vale Tudo, then Ultimate Fighting, martial artists from every discipline fought in fights that excluded no techniques. Finally, the world's fighting masters could prove their martial art was the best on Earth!

And the winner of the best martial art was...

All of them are.

And none of them. 

This revelation surprised everyone. The martial arts community assumed one discipline would reign supreme. But that wasn't the case because each discipline had a limited toolbox of techniques. Sometimes those techniques were very effective in a real fight; like Brazilian jit jitsu's submissions, or wrestling's dominate control. But many techniques like karate's katas, taekwondo's flashy high-kicks, boxing's obesssion with standing toe-to-toe and swinging for a knockout were easily countered and therefore not effective.

After several more years of fighting in "no rules" martial arts tournaments it became clear that some martial art disciplines were more effective than others, but each had drawbacks and none was complete. As Ultimate Fighting grew in popularity during the 1990s and 2000s, it forced all martial art communities to reflect on their techniques and beliefs.

As said in the opening quote, many practioners, referees, coaches, and pundits (especially from the least effective disciplines) choose to retreat back into their sub-cultures because they, "didn't like what they were finding out".

However, many fighters embraced the effectual truth revealed by Ultimate Fighting. As a result the world of martial arts started to get all mixed up.

Some kickboxers started to train submissions. Wrestlers learned some punching. Masters in one discipline started as eager newbies in another. Eventually, after several years of watching, learning, and participating in the cross-pollination of techniques, these fighters evolved skills far beyond their old martial arts teachers and disciplines.

By opening their mind, martial artists discarded loyalty to a single martial art and adopted evolution's philosophy of "adapt or die." A fighters physical pain became the barometer of whether a technique was good or bad. Finally, human self-defense learned what every lifeform on Earth knows; there is no rulebook.

No deer in the world depends on a judge to save it when fighting off a bear, as no bear depends on a pundit declaring it the winner to get its next meal.

Just like in Nature, the best martial art technique is entirely dependant on ones's opponent and surroundings while measuring the risks and rewards of the fight. Whatever techniques are most efficient to win the fight are the best.

Before Ultimate Fighting, all fighters were puting the horse before the cart, so to speak. They had the answers before knowing the problem because as students they were tricked into thinking fights are won or lost according to man-made rules governeed by teachers, pundits, and judges. 

Despite being misled, martial artists were never stupid. Their fault is quite human; they fell prey to good storytelling. 

Quality storytelling is why so many devoted boxers, judokas, and other practioners were so easily deceived by their respective discipline. Filled with history, culture, and traditions isolated martial art disciplines acted like echo chambers with a reality so complete, it tricked people into believing it was the single source of truth.

Once martial artists opened their minds, they started fighting for themselves. During the growth of Ultimate Fighting, fighters quickly realized the rules of boxing, kickboxing, wrestling, etc., were excellent for honing their chosen techniques but were also artificial and must be forgotten when preparing for an actual fight.

When fighters customized their techniques to the problems faced in a specific fight, evolution became their instructor and the community entered a brave new world. 

A world of remarkable progress. With an open mind and access to the world's information on the internet, fighters improved themselves by leaps and bounds every year. Kickboxers became wrestlers, Jiu-jitsu black belts learned high-kicks. The individual disciplines brought their techniques to an open marketplace of ideas.

With evolution as their teacher, these new martial artists started to listen to their bodies instead of other peoples stories. The speed of victories, and the less pain suffered in winning them, was the best judge, teacher, and pundit of what's the best fighting philosophy. The top martial arts trainers were the ones who helped their students adapt faster.

Fighters were always controlled by evolution, when the finally embrace it, they created new way for humans to think of self-defense called mixed-martial arts.

In mixed-martial arts, fighters don't limit themselves within the confines of an artificial rulebook. Instead, it's taught that everyone should learn a little from every discipline, and the best technique is the one that brings results. So devoted to this constant evolution, mixed-martial artists want everyone to improve because, "iron sharpens iron".

Mixing the human body's adaptability to learn many techniques, with a free mind willing to learn, created a new, self-correcting, and sustainable martial art. Today, even a moderately skilled mixed-martial artist is an overwhelming favorite against a champion of any single fighting discipline. Just as important, since mixed-martial arts includes all techniques, any person, whether short or tall, heavy or thin, aggressive or meek, can find their niche and learn to win a fight. 

And finding a niche is what evolution is all about. By empowering anyone and everyone, mixed-martial arts is the ultimate fighting philosophy.

On our journey to improve our politics, here's the lessons we should take from the story of mixed-martial arts.

Today, in the early 21st century, the middle-class has many systemic problems. Taxes get more confusing. School prepares students less for the job market. Insurance gets more expensive. And there are many more topics trending badly.

We all want better for ourselves and our kids, so we look around for ways to help.

Many people are sellling ideological politics. They each ideologue claim they can improve the economy. As the economy gets more uncertain, the more sales these ideologues close. As a result, many people today think being "political" means supporting a single ideology of "red", "blue", "green" and so on. These newly political people back one ideology by donating time and money, buying books, following pundits, going to rallies, and...

Regular people keep getting our asses kicked in our real lives.

Like old martial artists who believed their chosen discipline was the single source of truth, the middle-class keeps losing because we believe in _one_ ideology and wrongfully think our jobs, paychecks, and happiness are governed by its rulebook.

![Ant Death Spiral](/assets/problem-solving-philosophy.png)
_Ant Death Spiral. Image Needed._

Today's political ideologies are in a death spiral. Whether "red", "blue", "orange" or "green", they are going in circles trying to make their limited techniques improve the economy. Ideologies are lead by teachers, pundits, commentators who sell their books, lectures, podcasts the worst things get. This echo chamber is hard to break out of because each ideology is keep telling people that its chosen techniques of tax cuts, universal health-care, highway expansion, etc. give automatic success. And when we continue to feel the pain of real life problems, we're told other ideologies are not options because they break the ideological rulebook. Even worse, we're told we must attack other ideologies because the failing economy is _their_ fault.

The truth is, all political ideologies and their economic techniques are incomplete.

That's why I wrote _Techvolution_. It helps break any steadfast loyalty to one ideology and encourages you to realize you're a lifeform in Nature, and thus the only rules and techniques that matter are those that help you solve your specific and unique real life problems.

Nature is a street fight for the polar bear, martial artis, and you. For every one on Earth, evolution is the only teacher you need.

If we could teach evolution to polar bears, they'd have an easier time adapting to the times. When fighters did embrace evolution, they had a much easier time getting improved. When we all embrace evolution in our politics, we'll have the freedom of mind to mix and match ideologies to overcome any economic problem. Be it a dreadful morning commute, rising climate change, or debilitating government bureaucracy. This new philosophy might be called mixed-ideological politics.

Seeing through the death spiral of today's ideological echo chambers isn't easy. The constant storytelling of Twitter feeds, cable news, dinner table arguments is persuasive and hard to get away from. To see above today's political noise and salesmanship requires a solid understanding of storytelling. Once you got that, you'll avoid being sucked into the false security of ideological echo chambers.

Once you're protected from ideological stortelling, you can adopt mixed-ideological politics. After reading this book, you'll be as powerful in your politics as a mixed-martial artist is in a fight.

Maybe then, we'll fix our problems fast enough, so the polar bears won't need to learn evolution to cure their pain.

## Echo Chambers Are Needed, Until They're Not

- Remember we're not erasing ideologies.

Before we learn to protect ourselves from the echo chambers, it's important to always keep in mind, we're not erasing ideologies. We're only empowering ourselves to be like mixed-martial artists and mix and match ideologies to better solve our problems.

Some may be doubting our society can follow martial arts and embrace mixed-ideological politics. We can, hHere's another a field which has adopt a similarly enlightened philosophy.

Modern medicine has many disciplines and specialists. Some are based on cutting edge research, others on old school remedies. In the past, when isolated by geography and culture, people would be bound to do what the local healer or doctor prescribed. But today, you would never go to one medical professional, expecting them to be a master of every possible health problem.

There's simply too many human health problems for any one medical discipline to master.

That's why all medical professionals today, from hemopathic healers to neural surgeons, are recognized as sub-disciplines with their own techniques, cultures, and rulebooks. Every medical professional is allowed to say its strengths and weaknesses and admit its a niche and not the single source of truth. The skill in healthcare today is mixing disciplines to solve a patients pain as quickly as possible. While modern medicine certainly isn't perfect (especially its administration), it's nearly magical when compared the times when surgeons didn't santize their tools and doctors used one-size fits all solutions like leeches.

Modern medicine and mixed-martial arts improved so quickly because they are enlightened. The both recognize solving a fighter's, or patient's, pain is the ultimate sign of success.

So, if a person can train using different fighting techniques from many multiple martial arts disciplines, and doctors can refer their patients to specialists from other disciplines, why can't we also be self-aware enough, and respectful enough, to mix and match ideologies according to their strengths and weaknesses in solving your specific problems?

To enlighten our politics in such a way, we only have to accept no ideology is complete. Like in medicine or Ultimate Fighting, any ideological technique must be evaluated based on evidence of their real-world results and not ideological purity.

The biggest obstacle to mixed-ideological politics is the same as it was for mixed-martial arts. Ideological pundits, teachers, and commentators see their beliefs and techniques as the single source of truth. They can never embrace being another niche like doctors or mixed-martial arts embrace.

To achieve mixed-ideological politics, we must escape the spell of ideological echo chambers by training ourselves to understand why great stories are so magical.

## Cinderella

- how to see through echo chambers so we can mix and match them.

The classic fairytale _Cinderella_ is a great example of how to hook an audience.

The movie tells the story of a beautiful, diligent, and kind-hearted country girl named Cinderella. An unloved orphan, she lives her wicked stepmother and her two spoiled stepsisters. Forced to do all the chores without any help or appreciation. Cinderella's made friends with the local animals, but dreams of a better life and a chance to find happiness.

She’s ecstatic when she learns that the royal court is hosting an extravagent ball. The King wants to find a bride for his charming son. Cinderella's friends help her sew a dress for what's sure to be the most wonderful night of her life. But her evil family forbids her, mocks her uppitiness, and tears her dress to shreds.

The young girl is on the verge of tears. But, just as despair is about to set in, her Fairy Godmother appears. With a flick of her wand, the godmother transforms Cinderella’s ragged clothes into a dazzling gown and a pair of sparkling glass slippers. The fairy's magic also creates a carriage and a team of horses so that her mistreated goddaughter will finally have a night she’ll never forget.

At the party, Cinderella captivates everyone with her beauty and grace, especially the Prince. The two glide across the floor and whisper sweet nothings in each other’s ears. It looks like Cinderella's life is changed. Sadly though, the spell that gave Cinderella her magical night ends, forcing the shy orphan to flee from the ballroom, leaving the Prince with nothing but a glass slipper to remember her by.

The heartbroken Prince is determined to find his true love and orders his men to search the entire kingdom for the girl who fits the slipper.

They eventually get to Cinderella’s house. The wicked stepmother has gotten wise that her stepdaughter is the Prince’s heartthrob, and so locks her in the attic. Cinderella's friends come to her rescue, steal the key, and open the attic door just in time. Cinderella can now ask the Prince’s men if she can try on the glass slipper. Then, just as she’s about to, the evil stepmother smashes the precious mememto.

To which Cinderella responds by revealing she has the other slipper.

And the rest is history.

The movie _Cinderella_ was very popular when it was released. It's popular today. And it'll be popular hundreds of years from now when humanity is (hopefully) travelling the stars. People will always like it because everyone can sympathize with a warm hearted person overcoming bullies to improve her life

People love stories. We can't get enough of them. A good story lets us experience the drama, trials, and experiences of another person. From horrible brushes with death, to whimsical romances, stories teach us the lessons of many lives.

Stories pass-on so much information because they create a complete reality. This starts with the props that fill the storyworld with items, from cups to homes, we expect to see in any world. Next, there is music to relay the emotions of characters in the story. The dialogue of the story communicates what each character wants in an easy to understand way. Then there's the villain who earns their title because he likes the world the way it is and defends it against change. Next comes the philosophy of the story-world that dictates the rules everyone in the story is presumed to live by, for example Cinderella is supposed to obey her stepmother. Cinderella is a hero beausse she disreards the ruling philosphy and envisions a better world for herself. And at the top of this story pyramid are tools; a catchall term for the real objects, from slippers to Death Stars, that are above being regular props, because they are the levers of power that control what happens in the story-world.

The challenge of good storytelling is mixing these incredients together. When done properly, the resulting "cake" will transfix audiences and arise strong emotions and lasting commitments because so much information was packaged inside an easy to digest format.

---

And that brings us back to echo chambers and our need to escape today's ideological ones.

Dismantling echo chambers starts by realizing _Cinderella_ isn't about a girl controlled by her evil step-family. The fairytale is also not about a girl overcoming her evil step-family to marry her prince charming.

The story of _Cinderella_ is about a girl overcoming her step-family using levers of powers, i.e. tools.

If Cinderella doesn't get the horses, carriage, and evening dress from her Fairy Godmother, she'll never get into the ball. If the Prince didn't find her lost slipper, she'd never see him again. If the imprisoned girl's allies didn't steal the key to the attic, she'd never get out in time. And if Cinderella didn't have the second glass slipper, her name would be famous as a tragedy instead of a fairytale.

Cinderella had a problem, and it wasn't that her step-family were terrible people, nor was it that the rules of society were unjust. Her problem was that her terrible step-family controlled the tools Cinderella needed to improve her life.

Tools are the levers of power in every story. From _Star Wars_ to _The Matrix_, stories start with the villians controlling the tools while creating a ruling philosophy to justify their control. The hero suffers an injustice that lets them see a problem with the ruling philosophy. The drama of the story is heroes and villains battling to control the tools needed to change the world. The winner implements their philsophy and changes, or reaffirms, the world in their image.

If you were to bullet point Cinderlla, this is what it would looks like.

- Starting Reality - Cinderella is an orphane living with a hateful stepfamily.
- Hero insight - Cinderella decides to disobey her cruel stepmother and attend the ball.
- Back and forth drama - Cinderella, stepmother, and and their respective allies, battle to control evening ware, invitations, attic keys, glass slippers, and other levers of power.
- New reality - The winner, Cinderella, marries her prince charming and becomes a princess.

Notice the dynamic of the ruling philosophy. It has a public and hidden face. For example, when the stepmother rips Cinderella's gown, locks her in the attic, and destroys the slipper, she's using tools to alter the world in a consistent way, letting us see the philosophy of oppression in her heart.

Yet, the stepmother would likely not admit her abuse. She'd tell outsiders, and likely even herself, that Cinderella is loved and well cared for. If asked why her stepdaughter is working so hard, or absent from the ball, she'd say something like Cinderella is spoiled or acting up, and needs to be taught a lesson. 

The lesson is ruling philosophy's are two faced. An antagonist can believe one thing and proclaim it to the world, but the effect their tools have is what's truly in their hearts. Our actions determine our fate, not our wishes or ideologies.

To showcase how tools determine one's philosophy, think of Cinderella locked inside the dusty and cramped attic. The Prince's men are looking for her and if she can try on the slipper, her horrible life will change forever. So, what if her friends failed getting the key, but did get her a match?

Now the oppressed girl has some soul searching to do. Lighting a fire could get the Prince's mens attention, but the philsophy of possibly buring the house down, and killing herself and others, even to earn her freedom, is a different philosophy then getting some friends to steal a key and open a door.

The effects our tools have in the world determines what we truly believe in. 

Another important thing to learn from stories is that once they end, the hero and villian are no longer main characters. We don't need to hear from Cinderella after she marries the Prince because "they lived happily ever after". As for the stepmother, she has no more tools to attack Cinderella with, and is thus no longer a threat worthy of attention.

Tools being levers of power, philosophy being the effect of tools, and main characters having a limited shelf-life, are the facts those who sell themselves, and their philosophy, as being the eternal single source of truth that will solve all your problems, don't like.

## Mixed Ideologies Come By Ending Stories

- echo chambers end when we change tools, so we automatically mix and match them when we change tools.

>That's hardly a scientific observation Commander.

>Caption, the most elementary and valuable statement in science, the beginning of wisdom is, "I do not know". I do not know what this is sir.

_Lt. Commander Data_ [Star Trek](https://youtu.be/8eDYVtPwWiM)

When someone is telling you a story, and the hero and villian, and their philosophies, never go into the sunset, you're being sold an echo chamber. You are being told a unnatural story because there is no conclusion; just endless pages waiting to be filled with your time and money.

Echo chambers don't like conclusions because they force an assessment on whether the hero, his philosophy, and his chosen tools changed the world or not. Today's ideologues are not mixed-martial artists, doctors, or scientists searching for the best possible tools and techniques needed to fix your problem. Rather, ideologues are like salesman selling their chosen tools and techniques.

One ideology says green technology is a must buy to secure a properous future, while another says it's the enemy going to drive your family into debt. One ideology says gun ownership is killing innocent lives, another says guns are saving you from tyranical government. One side says government run healthcare is the only option for a healthy society, while another says corporate health-care is your only hope to stay alive.

And on and on the fued continues over cable news shows, Twitter, and society at large. Ideologues constantly fight over which tools are best. There is no middle ground because ideologies are are like fighting disciplines before mixed-martial arts; they sell themselves and their tools as being complete disciplines that can solve every one of your problems.

Remember, it was only when curious people said, "what descipline is best?" and engaged in real fights and looked at the evidence, that the illusion of completeness was erased from all but the most stubborn martial arts. Moreoever, it was only because Ultimate Fighting was officially searching for the best fighter that they bypassed rules to search for better techniques.

Today's ideologues don't have that freedom yet. One side can't rise taxes, the other can't cut them. One side fights unionzation as evil, while the other defends it as perfect. One side wants to expand government oversight and social programs, another wants to dismantle them both. Tools and techniques are always black or white to an ideologue. 

Tools are of course neither perfect or evil. They are inanimate. Like the glass slippers, they only hold value if they can help solve a problem. Since ideologies are not heroes but salesmen, they sell echo chambers meant to keep you using tool whether it's helpful or not.

To escape echo chambers, and embrace mixed-ideological politics, all you must do is understand when a mixed-martial arts enters a boxing gym, he's not being disloyal to his wrestling coach. When a family doctor refers you to a physiotherapist, she's not disloyal to medical doctors. When a biologist says "I don't know, ask a chemist" she's not being a bad biologist. This is because these fields understand they are sub-disciplines that exists to help a person solve a problem. They are each free to admit their limitaions and don't have to pretend they have all the answers.

Fighters overcome opponents. Patients battle diseases. Scientists research nature. Cinderella had an evil stepfamily.

What's your problem? And what tools do you need to solve it.

If you're willing to consider any tool, from a handgun to a solar panel, to solve your problem, you're on the way to mixed-ideological politics. If you think any tool is "off limits", you're at least partially stuck inside an echo chamber.

You should have the freedom to choose. Not only because it's proven so succesful in modern medicine and mixed-martial arts, but lets you harness evolution.

And evolution has no limits, respects no rules, and is the reason why you exist.

## There is No Lion King - Evolution

- changing techniques/tools is evolution. changing tools is technological evolution.

We weren't the first species to live on Earth and probably won't be the last. Life has survived billions of years without depending on any species. There's nothing special about any creature. We each survive and thrive according to the same laws of evolution.

- evolution is the story of stories. With the same use of tools to overcome adversity, over and over again.

Life needs evolution because the Universe is a hostile place that's. It's constantly changing; mountains fall apart, volcanoes erupt, stars emit radiation, heat is lost, and waves wash away shorelines. To respond to the ever-changing environment, Life must evolve a never-ending stream of new species that can find enough energy to procreate (Mayr 43).

Those who survive do so because their combination of attributes gives them an edge. But, as the Universe inevitably changes, some traits lose their advantage. Thus, while evolution is a constant race to harvest resources more efficiently than the next guy, no one ever knows if their list of adaptions is good enough to keep them alive. That's why pain hurts so much; it's Life's way of telling individuals to change their behavior and try something else before it's too late.

Evolution has these laws:

 - No species survives forever.
 - All lifeforms have a common ancestry.
 - Evolution of new species is gradual.
 - The number of species always multiplies to fill niches.
 - Natural selection determines which species lives.
 - Mayr pg. 86

These laws oversee every evolutionary race. The first sprint started after a few amino acids combined to form the first cells 3.6 billion years ago. Since then, evolution has continually created new species. Each is based on the one prior, but each removes or adds traits. The latest adaptation could mean getting bigger, faster, and stronger to hopefully outcompete another creature. Or, the new attribute could be further specialized to find a niche no one else has, such as polar bears being the only predators in a frozen ecosystem.

Regardless of what trait an organism tries, evolution's selection of the best adaptions requires a daily and hour scrutinizing, throughout the world, of every adaption, even the slightest. The best way to continually test species is with ecosystems. By putting creatures inside a shared environment, there are checks and balances. So, when any scavenger, predator, herbivore, or omnivore falls behind, Life is ready to create a new individual or species to take its place.

_Here's one example of how a species evolves. Mayr pg 176._

Although evolution has given rise to countless species over billions of years, the story of Life is well organized. Life works hard to adapt to its surroundings, so we can easily track evolution using Earth's geological changes (Mayr 58). Each period, epoch, and age of Earth's geography, from the Jurassic to the Paleozoic, have different characteristics like concentration of oxygen in the air, amount of water in the oceans, or ice in the poles. Because these geological changes required new species, they serve as chapters in the story of Life.

While Life's evolution was relatively seamless between each chapter, the change gave many species agonizing endings. Each time Earth's geology transitioned it was like a climatic conclusion asking if an individual's list of adaptations was needed in the changed environment. The few who passed the test climbed the ladder to the next age, while most adaptations went around in circles, stubbornly fighting their inevitable extinction. Their existence is only remembered as fossils to be maybe uncovered one day.

_The Evolutionary Spiral in the [history of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_evolutionary_history_of_life). From the perspective of Life, it's seamless, but for lifeforms, there are often tragic endings._

This summary misses the many details of evolution. But the essence is here: Life must adapt to Earth's ever-changing environment. The faster, the better; the more species, the better; no interference is justifiable. If evolution were a person, it would be an artist working night and day creting custom lifeforms to harvest every possible ray of sunshine, food scrap, and energy source. Evolution's constant creative  adaptations are the only reason Earth isn't just another rock revolving around a star with no one noticing how beautiful the Universe is.

And now, we understand why echo chambers are doomed. They presume an adaptation can be eternal. They commit themselves to a few tools and species and antagonize the evolution of new ones by telling stories of their devices' supposed perfection. Evolution, of course, doesn't care what we tell ourselves. Leaving those inside echo chambers to reconcile the ideology they passionately believe in against the pain they feel in the real world as they walk around in circles, finding someone to blame because they're unable to harvest enough resources to be happy and healthy.

As it's always been, evolution is our way out. Unfettered innovation explains why modern medicine, mixed-martial arts, and fairytale characters like Cinderella are so successful. They let themselves become many species by adapting to their situation. They examine their problem, and pickup whatever techniques or tool will help them solve it. Because of this freedom of mind, they can harness the power of evolution.

With one big difference. Humans do not evole. Technology does.

## Old Age, Ladder Climb, Final Frontier

- We live on thes same evolutionary tree as biology, but with technology.

The Boston Symphony had a problem. There was a lot of men in their ranks. That wasn't the problem though. The problem was they didn't know why. There were plenty of talented female musicians auditioning, yet not many were making the cut.

You might be thinking, make the audition blind. But it already was, no judge could see the musicians perform. Now you might be thinking, well, I guess that's it, the males were just better.

Instead of accepting that observation, the symphony tried something else. The judges asked the musicians to take their shoes off before walking on the audition stage. Now the judges couldn't see them, or hear their shoes.

And within a few years, the symphony was about equal men and women.

The sounds of the shoes was triggering a bias in the both male and female judges. By removing everything but the music, they heard only the music, and got a better product for their audiences.

That's a good little story. As we learned above, humans love stories. It's how we make sense of the world and pass-on knowledge.

Yet, stories are also our problem. We can understand cause and effect so easily that stories come naturally to us. But that doesn't mean we're good at reasoning which stories are real or fake. We can just as easily believe in a false story, as did the judges who heard footsteps instead of music, and martial artists who thought their stories would protect them in a real fight.

The whole trick of evolution is finding the perfect adaptation. And no one knows what that is. So we must respond to failure with another adaption as quickly as possible. The rest, like caring about gender and fighting rules, is all noise.

To find the perfect biological adaptation takes a lot of time. The genetic mutations needed to create a new species takes many generations because species are physically attached to their adaptations. That's why biological evolution is measured in millions of years.

We humans thus can't evolve biologically. If we did, then their might be a difference between male and female musicians. But it's not our genes that change when learning a tool like a violin or piano. Instead, we adapt our psychology to incorprate a new tool into our list of traits.

We are still of course biological lifeforms in nature, but because we invent new tools, we continue Life's evolution with technology instead of biology. There is effectively no difference. Life wants adaptations that can harvest resources, collect energy, and procreate. Life doesn't care about the material composition anymore than a composer or audience cares what gender the orchastra is.

Our technological evolution follows the same laws as regular evolution.

 - No technology survives forever.
 - All technology has a common ancestry.
 - Evolution of new tools is gradual.
 - The number of tools always multiplies to fill niches.
 - Natural selection determines which tools lives on.

Thus, we humans are biological vessels for technological evolution. Our fate is (mostly) determined by the tools in our hands, not the genes in our cells.

Our evolution requires innovators undertake the burden of inventing new technology, that becomes tools, that effectively becomes a new species once someone uses it. To connect people to new adapatations requires a reason, which is best communicated with a story. Therefore, innovation requires storytelling, often told inside marketing or ideology, to create a culture that connects person and tool.

This is what happened during the creation of judo, boxing, wrestling and the other martial arts. While these of course don't have much technology, they still use pads, ropes, gloves, weights, books, and eventually video, to train, learn, and pass on knowledge.

Thus, these martial arts used the human body as a foundation, with a different mixture of tools, turned the human body into boxers, judokas, kickboxers, and a variety of other distinct traits and therefore created different species.

Once home televisions and the internet allowed information to easily flow, it became possible to do what evolution does; review the species, find the best traits, select the most effective, and combine them all into a new improved species called mixed-martial arts.

But for humans to edit so many martial arts required fighters to see through the stories that connected people to each martial art. And seeing through stories isn't our best feature.

Why?

Because seeing through a story that connects us to an old way of life, we're essentially doing what Cinderella did when she decided to disobey her family; we're questioning the philosophy that governs our actions.

And, at that point, when we decide to evolve, old stories that connected us to non-functioning tools, become echo chambers trying to distract us. We can either listen to them and find someone to blame for our troubles, or venture into uncharted territory to find a better life.

It sounds noble to become a hero, but it's quite scary and hard. And this is especially relevant to us today sick of our toxic echo chambers.

Because, like it did with biological lifeforms so many times before, evolution is entering a new age. All lifeforms today thus have a huge choice to make; go round in circles struggling to find resources using outdated adaptations.

Or climb the ladder and evolve, as quickly as possible, so Life can prosper in the fledgling Internet Age.

The Roman general Julius Caesar had a problem. The territory he controlled west of the river Rhine was relatively prosperous and peaceful and so the Germans barbarians across the river kept raiding it. The Romans defeat the Germans when they fight pitched battles, which is why the Germans avoid fighting them, and instead used small boats and rafts to sneak attack in the night.

So, Caesar had to defeat an enemy that wouldn't fight him.

He came up with an idea. The Germans were a tribal people, with no written language, limited metal working, and primitive engineering. Meanwhile, the Romans built quality roads, long aquaducts, huge colliseums, and seemingly whatever else they wanted.

To showcase their technological power, Caesar decided to build a bridge.

The construction was carried out in an area where the depth of the river would be up to nine meters. The bridge was built on double wooden piles that were driven into the riverbed by winching up a large stone and releasing it, thereby driving the posts into the riverbed. The construction system ensured that the greater the flow of water, the harder the bridge was held together. Caesar’s soldiers built the bridge in just 10 days.

Watching the Roman legions crossing the river stupified the Germans. They struggled to get flimsy boats across the wide river, now they watched thousands of people walk over it. It would be like us seeing a city of people teleport to the Moon; a totally unknown adaptation our psychology isn't adapted to understand.

Caesar solved his problem by educating his enemy about technological evolution. He showcased how Romans were masters of the Classic Age, and the Germans were hundreds of years behind in the Iron Age. So impressed by Rome's almost magical powers, the Germans made peace that lasted for generations.

We already know evolution is tracked in ages like the famous Jurassic period. For humans those ages are the eras of new technology. The technology we hold determines where we are in the history of evolution. Here is a list of all the ages, and the civilizations that lead humanity to each.

  - Bronze Age: 	  2000 - 1250 (Babylon)
  - Iron Age:  		  1250 - 550  (Greek)
  - Classic Age:  	550 - 476   (Rome)
  - Middle Ages: 	  500 - 1439  (Abbasid)
  - Renaissance: 	  1440 - 1686 (Italy)
  - Science Age: 	  1687 - 1759 (France)
  - Industrial Age: 1760 - 1969 (Britain/America)
  - Internet Age: 	1970 -      (tbd)
  <small>(this timeline is Europe and Middle East centric. Other civilization made many technological advancements, but the geography around the Mediterranean was best suited to enable continous technological evolution. Read "Guns, Germs, and Steel" to find out more. Remember, there are many more eras in front of us then behind us.)</small>

Like Julius Caesar demonstrated, the difference between ages is very wide. A fundamental new technology is an entirely new stage of evolution, with a totally different list of traits at the hands of its people. 

Despite the power of technological evolution, we don't always evolve. People in need will choose evolution for the same reason all lifeforms do, the physical pain of failure tells them to try using a new hunting weapon, chance crossing a large river in a new raft, try cooking a new food. However, once human beings evolve enough to solve pain, we stop often evolving, and instead tell stories.

Stories are meant to pass-on knowledge to aid everyone's continuous evolution, but absent of pain, they often become means to prevent feeling the pain of regular life. As the saying goes "hard times creates hard people, who work hard to create easy times, which thus breeds easy people, who stop working hard, and thus create hard times". During this transition, the stories used to pass-on the hard-won lessons of evolution, transform into stories to antagonize it. 

This is best seen in the changeover from age to age. No civilization keeps its leadership after winning an age.

Julius Caesar showed us why. 

A new age is totally different. The "easy people" have high social standing, away from frontline pain, inherited from their ancestors. The new age requires new race of evolution is needed where everyone starts at the same starting line again. To prevent society's technological evolution taking away their special status, leaders create stories like elitism, racism, and sexism for the same reason Cinderella's stepmother tore the dress, locked the attic, and shattered the glass slipper.

>"The history of evolution is a steady extinction of species and the origin of new species. Thus turnover is often apparently due to the superiority of a new species over an established species." Mayr 132.

Antagonists are people who don't want the story to change. And the conclusion of a technological age is the end of a story. And in 1970 humanity invented the personal computer and the internet. Since then our society's storytellers have avoided evolution not matter the increasing pain felt on the frontline.

- NOBODY KNOWS. WHAT DOES MICHAEL SCOTT DO. 
- IT'S THE END OF THE STORY. THERE ARE NO MORE HEREOES, NO MORE VILLIANS.
- ALL PAST ROYALS RESISTED CONCLUSIONS, AND EVOLUTION/INNOVATION.
- INDUSRIAL AGE CULTURE, AND PEOPLES, ARE GOING DOWN.

<Flipper1970 />

And hence, you should now understand why our echo chambers exist, and why the are doomed. It's no accident echo chambers are yelling fests that never have an ending; both their ideologies are from the Industrial Age. They keep talking keep you walking in circles. They each blame each other people for your problems because each are effectively a dinosaur in the ice age; a species unfit to find enough resources to live a happy and healthy life.

Mass consumption is their bread and butter of their tools. Broadcast television, mass-media, globalized supply chains, entertainment, relatively immigration and migration, centralization of production.

 - No technology survives forever, but the Industrial Age powerbrokers want there's it to.
 - All technology has a common ancestry.
 - Evolution of new tools is gradual.
 - The number of tools always multiplies to fill niches. Mass production and mass society prvents this.
 - Natural selection determines which tools lives on. There are no human referres or middlemen. There can be natural selection unless the people using a tool are free to decide to keep using it, or choose another.



 - the oft said "i want to decentralize power" is the required evolutionary step of speciation.
 - queen ball, bees kill their queen when non-functioning

 - We never had to teach the polar bear evolution. It already knows life is a hussle and no rules will save you but finding and saving enough calories to keep going so you procreate more than anyone else. There is no way for any lifeform to do otherwise. Except you, you need to learn about evolution, so you can build the technological ecosystem that perpetuates it to forever vanquish evolution's antagonists on Earth.

Both echo chambers, agree to keep consuming to maintain themselves. One said wants to print more money, the other wants to conserve. One side wants to consume more natural resources, the other wants to conserve. The result is, a tactical compromise to keep consuming and conserve nothing. All in a desperate effort to keep the Industrial Age alive. Each echo chamber represents a bygone lifeform whose list of attributes isn't up to the task of evolving new species that can harvest enough resources to procreate inside healthy ecosystems.

The chance to bring the consumption, debt, natural resources, debt, inflation and the cost of living rates<button @click="rdegg = !rdegg">-</button>down proactively and ease ourselves into the Internet Age has passed. 

The cost of living, workplace efficiency, mortgage debt, will keep getting more expensive because they are the after effects of aging adaptations and hyper-industrialization. And they won't evolve on their own. The people with the authority to evolve value their egos over their futures. They are the teachers, pundits, educators, gatekeepers of old martial arts, and you're the fighter and patient on the frontline feeling the pain.

They want you to blame, when you should evolve.

So, you must be you're own mixed-martial arts trained Cinderella and pickup whatever tools helps improve your future. But to do these things you must learn how disregard the rules that govern you today and decide to climb the ladder to the Internet Age.

This mixed-ideological politics even has a nice new name called Techvolution.

-------

- pain is still life's way to communicate change needed, but we must have a free innovation to sovle it to have evolution.
- Tools effectual lifecycle is the ride we're on, especially because echo chambers sustain non-functionality.
- only end users on the frontline (fightters, patients, Cinderella) feel pain, and have a valid say in the adoption of new tools. Everyone else is but a teacher/manager/coach/stepmother who has all the incentive in the world to tell stories why evolution is bad.

- mammal/bird parents pass-on knowledge.
  - we can't learn from parents as we're in a new age.
  - new age equals new frontier.
  - Mayr 253.
- Large populations are inert and don't evolve fast.
  - Founder populations face more selective pressure b/c environment is novel, thus evolve faster.
  - Mayr 193.
- Founder vs Corps.
  - Established species have a large and therefore inert gene pool that washes away new genes.
  - Founding pops have limited gene pools, more likely to absorb new genes and phenotypes.
  - Mayr 135.
- The General Rule of Speciation
  - No strict rule or formula to achieve speciation.
  - General rule, "The less gene flow there is between populations, the more rapidly speciation will occur, all else being equal"
  - Ie. local need solved by local greed, and vice versa.
  - Mayr 186.
- Components of evolution
  - Darwinian evolution is a byproduct of two divergent forces, chance (involuntary mutation) and neccesity (surviving the selection process). Mayr 229.
  "No individual is ever perfectly adapted...the main reason for this is perhaps that every genotype represents a compromise of genetic variability and stability." Mayr 145.
  - Two halves of our social society, creation and generation, both are going overboard with their art/spectacle, and the result is loss of function/evolution.
