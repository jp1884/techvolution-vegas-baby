## Backpage

If you don't like politics, or you feel pressured to care because politics is suddenly everywhere, this book is for you. Despite the uproar on television, radio, and dinner tables, you don't need to pick a side in the Left versus Right war.

We've all sat through a sales pitch. The salesman use catchy words and false urgency to oversell the good parts and ignore the bad ones in the hopes of closing a sale on a questionable product like used car or phone plan.

Today's heated politics is the same as salesmanship.

That's because the Right and Left are sales departments of aging products. Everything from SUVs, corporate healthcare, and for-profit prisons on the Right. To EVs, government healthcare, and university education on the Left. Each side oversells the good parts, plays down the bad, uses catchphrases like "liberty" and "justice" to appeal to their customers, and creates an urgency that it's "use my products, or else the other side will ruin society."

Left and Right ideologues are so emotional because they want to close a sale. Don't buy it. This book teaches a new kind of politics. One that uses modern technology to fix problems today so our kids, country, and planet have a better tomorrow.

## Inner Flap

_Here is where political philosophy enters. People often don't always reason well, but they do always look for a reason—and political philosophy starts from that fact. In America today, Progressives argue that wealth is unjustly distributed, for example, but they overlook the need to generate wealth. Conservatives do the reverse; preoccupied with wealth generation, they pay little attention to how it should be distributed._

_A partisan difference like this one is not a clash of "values," with each side blind to the other and with no way to decide between them. A competent judge could ask both sides why they omit what they do, and he could supply reasons even if the parties could not. Such a judge is on the way toward making a new political philosophy._

Harvey C. Mansfield, _A Student's Guide to Political Philosophy_

Whole Foods shoppers want fair-trade coffee. Corvette collectors are ready to buy another model. Martha Stewart Living subscribers would love to renovate their home again.

Right and Left ideologues want to sell their chosen products. But they don't go out and say that because they have thousands of items in their catalog. The only way to sell each of them is to use philosophy. Because like with brands, once a person buys into philosophy, they will sell themselves the products of its unique way of thinking.

Political philosophy is a long and complicated road. Still, it's fair to say today that the Right believes in Conservative philosophy started by [Edmund Burke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Burke) in 1806. While, the Left believes in the Progressive philosophy that [John Stuart Mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill) wrote in 1859.

Conservative and Progressive philosophies were invented in the early Industrial Age to help our very poor ancestors concentrate enough wealth to build the first railroads, mills, and factories and then distribute the resulting products to overcome everyone's extreme poverty.

They did it!

Which is why politics wasn't so heated in the past. Both sides we're selling new things like trains, stoves, textbooks, pens, and so much more stuff that mostly sold itself because it lifted them from poverty.

After years of advancements we longer have primitive factories or mass hunger, illiteracy, and disease (if you're thinking about all the poor people in the world today, that is okay, but still marvel at the fact in the 1800s, almost all persons lived in poverty and there was no one to blame or send help because poverty-fighting tools didn't exist yet).

Today's Conservatives and Progressives fight so much because their Industrial Age products, and therefore their Industrial Age philosophies, are out of date. Their time has passed. They mock the other's datedness for entertainment because that's the only way to maintain their own believers' loyalty and attract new buyers. Their sales pitch has devolved into "The Right is concentrating too much wealth!" or "The Left is distributing too much wealth!" to which the other side screams to its followers, "That's what we're supposed to be doing! Keep going! Don't them _them_ stop us!"

And both sides are correct.

If we were in the Industrial Age and trying desperately to keep factories from going broke or ending yet another cholera epidemic (both were common). But we're in the Internet Age with advanced robotics, supercomputers, clean energy, 5G internet, smartphones, AI, blockchain, and many more products that easily generate and distribute wealth. Yet, because we're using Conservativism and Progressivism to wield Internet Age tools, our current problem is too much wealth concentration (i.e., thousands of billionaires) and too much wealth distribution (i.e., printing money).

This book introduces Techvolution, a new philosophy combining Progressivism and Conservatism into an updated and improved package. Techvolution generates wealth easily and distributes it fairly by putting the incredible wealth-generating power of Internet Age technology into each person's hands.

Only a new philosophy rises above the increasing Conservative and Progressives hatred. By removing the cobwebs of their long history, we can remind everyone that feeling hate and placing blame for our problems doesn't change our fate. We are creatures in Nature, and as it does for all species, Life demands we evolve new and improved adaptations to solve our problems.

We either innovate a new Internet Age society proactively under the direction of Techvolution's new way of thinking or, after many depressions, wars, and revolutions, gradually teach us the lessons reason wasn't able to.

## Dedication

For everyone using their soul while creating something new.

## Note to the Reader

To teach humanity about our own evolution, Techvolution uses Aristotle's _Poetics_ to better understand Hegelian dialectics to showcase how humanity continues Life's Darwinian evolution via technological innovation. That's a mouthful, so it's easier to say this new philosophy explains why the politics inside our families, workplace, governments, and societies are best understood as another story in Life's long and ongoing evolution.

I wrote a deep dive in a book called [_Story Cut Tools_](https://storycuttools.netlify.app/), which is a good read but also long. I wrote this summary with enough meat so you can skip the nerdy philosophical details and jump right into a new philosophy. It will put the power of evolution in your hands so you can evolve a new society today.

## Evolution

As you read this, a penguin is diving for fish, an ant colony is raiding its neighbor, a polar bear is stalking a seal, and trillions more lifeforms are battling for survival.

Living in the wild is tough, but many creatures struggle extra hard today. The environment is changing fast. Among other things, forests, greenfields, and ice caps are disappearing. That means lifeforms such as polar bears have increasingly unhelpful adaptations. They still have Life's burning desire to survive and procreate, but their form of white coat and colossal bulk is losing its once mighty advantage to kill seals in the Arctic.

What would you tell a polar bear if you could communicate with her?

Wouldn't it be nice to explain that since the environment constantly changes, Life must continually evolve lifeforms with new traits. Traits are the expressions of genes, which are passed on from parents to offspring during reproduction. Thus, Life on Earth is a ongoing game. The organisms that harvest calories the fastest while enduring the least pains of hunger, disease, and thirst pass on their genes more often. Over time, this turnover of genes innovates the new creatures evolution needs to keep Life playing the game.

If we could educate the polar bear about evolution, she would know her endangered place in the story of Life. She could then assess what innovations polar bears need to prosper in the Artic's new environment. Perhaps male polar bears should help raise their cubs. Or polar bears should hunt in packs to kill reindeer. Maybe the mighty flesh eaters should go south and diversify their diet with berries, grubs, and roots.

Whatever new traits polar bears will eventually have, if they knew about evolution, they could roll their own dice until they find the adaptations that'll regain their prosperity. At least by understanding how evolution works, polar bears wouldn't feel so frustrated as they walk in circles today, struggling to find seals in a changed environment.

We know the future of polar bears because paleontologists, biologists, genealogists, and other specialists have mapped millions of species' habits, linages, and physiologies. This extensive knowledge lets scientists inform humanity about many creatures' history, status, and future.

Here's a question: Do we know our fate like we know the polar bears? Given how much anger, angst, and confusion we have in our politics, the answer is clearly no.

This book will teach you about human evolution. Our story is the same as all lifeforms. The environment is constantly changing; thus, Life demands we develop updated adaptations to harvest enough resources to keep Life procreating and, therefore, evolving. Or, Life finds someone else.

Humans think we understand Life's requirement to evolve. Almost every leader, company, ideology, and philosophy says they'll provide enough resources for their people to live a happy Life. But all the marches, protests, strikes, fears of job losses, and other outbursts of frustration from society today show we don't know how to drop old ways of living and adopt the new adaptations we need to prosper. Indeed, most of today's Conservative vs. Progressive politics is about resisting evolution to keep old products alive and then trying to justify why "the other" should bear the burden of society's refusal to stop being polar bears and start anew.

Techvolution will teach you how to move on from the past. You'll roll your own dice in the game of evolution and adopt the technological innovation that'll put the power of wealth-generating modern technology into your, and everyone else's, hands.

Because animals sadly can't change their genes. They must endure the pain of "survival of the fittest" to evolve. We can change our fate by updating our characteristics with modern technology. But before we use modern technology to regain our prosperity, we must upgrade our politics with the lessons of evolution. The recipe is to take one part Left and one part Right and mix them together.

## Mixed-Ideological Politics

>I thought you guys would like to hear this story. I know my fellow wrestlers know exactly what I'm talking about. A martial art is either real or it's not. Very early on in the sport of mixed-martial arts, when the logical assumption from the marketing team is that you're going to get every taekwondo student, every karate student, every judo practitioner, and every aikido and they're just going to absolutely love mixed-martial arts.

>It ended up being the absolute opposite.

>All of those arts that I just named that, turned out to not be real, or at least real in terms of their effectiveness in actual combat, steered as far away from mixed-martial arts as they could. They begged their students not to watch. Found a number of different reasons why mixed-martial arts is too violent or too, whatever their excuse was.

>Because the practioners of old martial arts didn't like what they were finding out. They had bought into it. They had spent their Life. They had mastered some of these old martial arts movements. To only find out that it was a waste of time.

In its highest form, politics discusses what direction a society should take. Individuals give their opinions, offer their perspectives, and exchange ideas. Should society invest in a new dock or a new road? Should we go to war or make peace? Should we attract newcomers or invest in citizens? Good politics is like a healthy nervous system directing resources to solve the pains of its society.

But daily politics isn't always so rational.

Cells in the human body are constantly fighting for resources, and we, the people who make up the ["body politic"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_politic) of our respective countries, are no different. Even in good times, daily politics is full of ranting, half-truths, and memes because individuals are arguing for tax breaks, subsidies, government bailouts, and government loans.

Why would anyone want to be left out?

Political philosophy is supposed to rise above daily politics and create a shared vision for society. Only when a body politic works together can its members build a healthy nervous system that heals enough pains to keep its evolution going. A good philosophy makes people realize humans are not the final judge of right or wrong. As it is for all creatures, Mother Nature ultimately decides if our way of Life is harvesting resources well enough to keep our civilization playing the game of evolution.

So, while many ignorant polar bears are doomed to suffer for many more years, with a good philosophy, humans can be happy and healthy in a constantly evolving society; as happened when young Conservatism and Progressive together lifted so many people from poverty.

To evolve, we humans develop new traits. We try to change our "genes," so to speak. We train techniques to enhance our bodies. We change government policies to direct our resources in better ways. We open businesses to utilize goods and services differently. We invent tools to solve our problems with lasting solutions. And we learn new ideas to expand our minds.

Whatever traits we develop, we do it to solve our pains. 

Martial arts is a great example.

Karate, kickboxing, taekwondo, sambo, wrestling, aikido, jiu-jitsu, judo, and boxing are our most popular martial arts. Each teaches unique techniques like wrist locks or body punches for self-defence. To practice their skills each martial art creates rules that say only their techniques are allowed; there's no kicking in a boxing match, for example.

The world's martial arts co-existed for many years. Inside the disciplines, teachers happily taught their techniques to the next generation, practioners would train almost every day, and the best students would compete in tournaments, get scholarships, and strive to become world champions. The rules, history, and ethics of a discipline created a unique fighting philosophy that was kept lively by everyone congregating around experts, debates, and the latest news.

But never would these martial artists compete against each other.

However, in the late 1980s, as home televisions spread information worldwide, once-isolated fighting cultures started to open up. People got curious. As fighters began to watch other disciplines, they asked themselves, "Which martial art is best?"

Would a boxer beat a kickboxer? What about a wrestler versus a karate guy? Many people wanted to know what if martial artists threw away their rule books and fought a real fight.

In the early 1990s, the questions stopped and the fighting started. At first, called Vale Tudo, then Ultimate Fighting, martial artists from every discipline competed in fights that excluded no techniques. Finally, the world's fighting masters could prove their martial art was the best on Earth!

And the winner of the best martial art was...

All of them are.

And none of them.

This revelation surprised everyone. The martial arts community assumed one discipline would reign supreme. But none did because each fighting style had a limited toolbox of techniques. Sometimes those techniques were very effective in a real fight, like Brazilian jiu-jitsu's submissions or wrestling's dominant control. But many techniques like karate's katas, taekwondo's flashy high kicks, and boxing's obsession with standing toe-to-toe and swinging for a knockout were easily countered and therefore [ineffective](https://youtube.com/shorts/4IjqBuo3Bow?feature=share).

As Ultimate Fighting tournaments continued it became clear that some martial art disciplines were more effective than others, but each had drawbacks and none was complete. When Ultimate Fighting grew in popularity during the 1990s and 2000s, it forced all martial art communities to reflect on their fighting techniques, styles, and philosophy.

As said in the opening quote, many practioners, coaches, and pundits (especially from the least effective disciplines) choose to retreat back into their sub-cultures because they, "didn't like what they were finding out". I.e. they were teaching ineffective self-defense techniques.

To mask themselves from this truth, stubborn martial artists formed echo chambers. Inside they talked about their glorious history, impressive morality, and superior fighting philosophy to new prospects, existing members, and the public at large. It was all salesmanship to protect themselves from simple discussions about their disiplines self-defence ineffectiveness.

However, many fighters embraced the effectual truth revealed by Ultimate Fighting. As a result the world of martial arts started to get all mixed up.

Kickboxers trained submissions. Wrestlers learned some punching. Masters in one discipline started as eager newbies in another. Like a bumblebee going from flower to flower, pioneering fighters like Bas Rutten, Maurice Smith, and Ken Shamrock cross-pollinated techniques and evolved skillsets far more complete than any one martial art teacher or discipline.

By opening their mind, these new martial artists discarded loyalty to a single discipline and adopted evolution's philosophy of "adapt or die." The school-like system of old disciplines with their grades, belts, trophies, medals, and scholarships became stepping stones to building a complete skillset and not end-goals to be relished. A fighters physical pain was the new barometer of whether a technique was good or bad.

Finally, human self-defense learned what every lifeform on Earth knows, loyalty to man-made philsophies will not save you in Nature.

No deer in the world depends on a judge to save it when fleeing a bear, as no bear depends on a pundit declaring it the winner to get its next meal. Just like in Nature, the best martial art technique is entirely dependant on ones's opponent and surroundings while measuring the risks and rewards of the fight.

Despite being misled by teachers, pundits, and judges about the completeness of a particular martial art, fighters weren't stupid. Their fault is quite human; they fell prey to good storytelling. 

Quality storytelling is why so many devoted boxers, judokas, and other practioners were sucked in by their respective fighting discipline. Filled with history, culture, and traditions, isolated martial arts each had a philosophy so complete, it tricked people into believing it was the single source of truth.

During the growth of Ultimate Fighting, most fighters quickly realized the rules of boxing, kickboxing, wrestling, etc., let practioners honed their chosen techniques. But the rules were artificial and must be forgotten when training for real fights.

After fighters embraced all disciplines, they entered a brave new world.

A world of remarkable progress and democratization. With an open mind, video cameras, and the internet, fighters created a wealth of training videos and distributed the content for everybody to learn from. Thus, like a forest of pollinators, fighters improved themselves by leaps and bounds every day. Kickboxers became wrestlers, Jiu-jitsu black belts learned high-kicks. Each martial art became a sub-discipline that brought its techniques to an open marketplace of ideas.

With evolution as their teacher, these new martial artists listened to their bodies to guide them to the best mixture of techniques, trainers, and discplines. All the while, the speed of victories, and the less pain suffered in winning them, was the best judge, teacher, and pundit of martial arts techniques. The top trainers were the ones who put their students needs above their own by helping fighters adapt better techniques faster.

When fighters finally embraced evolution, they created a new way for humans to think of self-defense called mixed-martial arts.

In mixed-martial arts, everyone, from fighters to trainers, pundits to fans, veterans to newbies, is accountable to the open standards of evolution. Thus, fighters don't limit themselves within the confines of a single philosophy. Every martial art has something to offer, so everyone should be a bumble bee going fom flower to flower learning from each discipline. The best technique is the one that brings results. Evolution is so admired by mixed-martial artists that everyone is supposed to give their opinions, offer their perspective, and exchange ideas, because "iron sharpens iron".

Mixing the human body's adaptability with a free mind willing to learn any technique, created a new, self-correcting, and sustainable martial art. Today, a skilled mixed-martial artist is an overwhelming favorite agaisnt a champion of any single fighting discipline. Just as important, since mixed-martial arts includes all techniques, any person, whether short or tall, heavy or thin, aggressive or meek, can "mix and match" techniques to find their niche and learn to win a fight. 

And finding a niche is what evolution is all about. By empowering anyone and everyone, mixed-martial arts is the ultimate fighting philosophy.

<!-- ![Mixed-martial arts ecosystem]() -->
_Martial artists built many disciplines. The new philosophy of mixed-martial arts set the bar higher  by putting everyone on notice. Evolution is right to decide which technique is best._

---

On our journey to improve our politics, here's the lessons we should take from the story of mixed-martial arts.

Today, in the early 21st century, the middle-class suffers systemic problems. Taxes get more confusing. School prepares students less for the job market. Insurance gets more expensive. And there are many more pains in our society trending badly.

Looking at hour rising bills and shrinking savings accounts, we feel beat up. And, so we look around for help.

We find lots of people selling ideological politics on television, social media, and back yard barbeques. They get our attention because ideologues insist their techniques and tools improve the economy. As the economy gets more uncertain, the more sales these ideologues close. As a result, many people think being "political" requires supporting a single ideology of "red", "blue", "green" and so on. These new ideological converts buy books, follow pundits, go to rallies, and...

Regular people keep getting our asses kicked in our real lives.

We think good politics means supporting _one_ ideology and wrongfully think our government, paychecks, and happiness are governed by its rulebook. But like in fighting, learning one ideology is not enough to bring prosperity. 

Today's ideological teachers, pundits, and commentarors are not philosophers pondering how best to relieve the pains of our entire body politic. They are salesman pushing their chosen techniques and tools without even knowing what fight we're in.

<!-- ![Ant Death Spiral](/assets/problem-solving-philosophy.png) -->
_Ant Death Spiral. Image Needed._

Thus, our ideologues are in a sort of death spiral. Whether "red", "blue", "orange" or "green", they are going in circles trying to make their Industrial Age techniques improve the economy single handedly. They keep failing for the same reason no single martial art discipline can be the single source of truth. Problems don't adapt to solutions. Like the polar bears are finding out, lifeforms must evolve to overcome problems.

To solve our pains with Internet Age technnology requires we stop being so loyal to a single ideology and it's limited tools and techniques.

As of now, we listen to ideological salesman contort our worldview with simple observations that justify their sales pitch. If people quit their jobs en masse, they _all_ must be lazy say Conservatives. Or if lots of people rob stores, they _all_ must be hungry say Progressives. As bad bosses continue to lose workers, lots of true criminals run amok, and other symptons get worse, ideologues retreat into their echo chambers because "they don't like what they're finding out".

That's why I wrote _Techvolution_. It helps break any steadfast loyalty to one ideology and encourages you to realize you're a lifeform in Nature. You should only be loyal to the rules, techniques, and tools that solve your current real life problems. Because Nature is a street fight for polar bears, martial artists, and you.

If we could teach evolution to polar bears, they'd have an easier time adapting to their new envionment. When fighters did embrace evolution, they improved their powers very quickly. When we embrace evolution in our politics, our body politic will have the freedom of mind to mix and match tools and techniques to overcome any economic problem. Be it dreadfully unproductive jobs, worsening climate change, or debilitating government bureaucracy.

You could describe Techvolution as mixed-ideological politics.

Seeing through the death spiral of today's ideological echo chambers isn't easy. The constant storytelling of Twitter feeds, cable news, dinner table arguments is engrossing. To see above the salesmanship requires a solid understanding of storytelling. Once you got that, you'll avoid being sucked into the false security of ideological echo chambers.

Once you're protected from political storytelling, you’ll have the freedom of mind to use any Internet Age tool and technique to find your niche. After which you'll be as powerful in your politics as a mixed-martial artist is in a street fight.

<!-- ![Bills Bills Bills]() -->
_You are a member of the body politics. Your pain determines what techniqes and tools are good and bad. The lesson to learn is you can’t get resources by holding back another’s evolution because “iron sharpens iron.”_

## We Need Chambers, Just Not Echo Chambers

Before we learn to protect ourselves from today's Industrial Age echo chambers, it's important to remember that we're not erasing ideologies. We're only becoming like mixed-martial artists so we can mix and match policies, techniques, and tools to better solve our real-life pains.

That means we mustn't ever judge a tool by its ideological cover. Gas SUVs are sometimes needed, but sometimes EVs are too. Occasionally, we do need to raise taxes. But sometimes we need to cut them. GMO food can be bad, but there's also pluses too. What tool or technique we choose depends on the pain and the risks and rewards of using a particular solution.

Some may doubt that our society can follow martial arts and embrace mixed-ideological politics. We can. Here's another field with a similarly enlightened mix-and-match philosophy.

Modern medicine has many disciplines and specialists. Some are based on cutting-edge research, others on old-school remedies. In the past, when isolated by geography and culture, patients were bound to do what the local healer or doctor prescribed. But today, you would never go to one medical professional, expecting them to be a master of every health problem.

There are simply too many illnesses and injuries for any medical discipline to master them all.

That's why all medical professionals today, from homeopathic healers to neural surgeons, are recognized as sub-disciplines. Each has its own tools and techniques, rulebooks, and culture. Medical professionals from each field can say their strengths and weaknesses and admit they are a niche rather than the single source of truth. The philosophy of modern healthcare is mixing disciplines to solve a patient's pain as quickly as possible. While modern medicine certainly isn't perfect (especially its administration), it's nearly magical compared to when surgeons didn't sanitize their scalpels and doctors used one-size-fits-all solutions like leeches.

Most importantly, we understand medical professionals can be corrupt. If a doctor over-prescribes medication or sells "snake oil," we know the doctor isn't following evidence-based medicine and, therefore, has illegitimate authority to diagnose problems.

Modern medicine and mixed-martial arts thus embrace evolution. Both medical and mixed martial arts recognize that it is best to select from an ecosystem of options and that solving a fighter's or patient's pain is the only sign of success. Other human endeavors are also enlightened enough to embrace real-world results as superior to a teacher or boss's authority. [Baseball for example did it with Moneyball fame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MjxoaynCmk).

So, if a person can train techniques from multiple martial arts disciplines, and doctors can refer their patients to specialists from other disciplines, why can't our politics also be self-aware enough, and mature enough, to mix and match different policies, tools, and techniques according to their strengths and weaknesses in solving your unique economic problems?

<!-- ![Picture of a cell]() -->
<!-- _The autonomic nervous system heals our bodies. We only know something is wrong when we feel pain. Your economic pains are also indicators to change our ways. We need Technvolution so we'll be willing to use any tool that'll heal our pains._ -->

To enlighten our politics in such a way, we only have to accept no ideology is complete. Like in medicine or Ultimate Fighting, any technique or tool must _not_ be evaluated on its ideological purity but based on evidence of its real-world results in reducing hunger, thirst, cold, depression, anxiety, and the other pains Life gives us so we change our ways before its too late.

Ideologues from everywhere on the political spectrum will (eventually) learn they don't need to take themselves so seriously, burden themselves so much, or sell their services so aggressively. Like a boxing coach or speech pathologist, each can improve their chosen techniques and tools and let people come to them as needed.

But for now, the biggest obstacle to mixed-ideological politics is the same as it was for mixed-martial arts. Ideological pundits, teachers, and commentators don't realize the value of a mix-and-match philosophy, so they tell great stories about why their beliefs, techniques, and rulebooks are the single source of truth inside echo chambers. To use mixed-ideological politics to find the niche of Internet Age tools we need to live a better Life, we must escape the spell of ideological echo chambers by understanding why we buy into great stories so easily.

## Cinderella

The classic fairytale _Cinderella_ knows how to hook an audience.

The movie tells the story of a pretty, diligent, and kind-hearted country girl named Cinderella. An unloved orphan, she lives with her wicked stepmother and two spoiled stepsisters. Jealous of her beauty, Cinderella's step family antagonize her amibitions, belittle her abilities, and force her to do all the house chores. With only the local animals for companionship, the lonely teenager dreams of a better life and a chance to find happiness.

Cinderella is ecstatic when the King announces he's hosting an extravagent ball to find a bride for his charming son. Filled with excitement, Cinderella's friends help her sew a dress for what's sure to be the most wonderful night of her life.

But, just before departing for the party, her evil family forbids her, mocks her uppitiness, tears her dress to shreds and leaves the young orphan home alone in tears.

Thankfully, just as despair is about to set in, Cinderella's Fairy Godmother appears. With a flick of her wand, the godmother transforms Cinderella’s ragged clothes into a dazzling gown and a pair of sparkling glass slippers. The godmother also creates a carriage and a team of horses so her mistreated goddaughter will go to the ball in royal style.

At the party, Cinderella captivates everyone with her beauty and grace, especially the Prince. The two glide across the floor and whisper sweet nothings in each other’s ears. Sadly though, the spell that gave Cinderella her dress and entourage ends. The shy orphan flees the ballroom, leaving the Prince with only a glass slipper to remember her by.

The heartbroken boy is determined to find his true love and orders his men to search the entire kingdom for the girl who fits the glass slipper.

They eventually get to Cinderella’s house. The wicked stepmother has gotten wise that her stepdaughter is the Prince’s heartthrob, and so locks her stepdaughter in the attic. To the rescue come Cinderella's friends who steal the key and open the attic door. Cinderella can now ask the Prince’s men if she can try on the glass slipper. But, just as she’s about to, the evil stepmother smashes the precious mememto.

To which Cinderella responds by revealing she has the other slipper.

And the rest is history.

The movie _Cinderella_ was very popular when it was released. It's popular today. And it'll be popular hundreds of years from now when humanity is (hopefully) travelling the stars. People will always like the story because everyone can cheer for a warm hearted person overcoming bullies to improve her life

People love stories. We can't get enough of them. A good story lets us experience the drama, trials, and experiences of another person. From horrible brushes with death, to whimsical romances, stories teach us the lessons of many lives.

Stories pass-on so much information because they create a new reality. The creation process starts with the props that fill the storyworld with cups, clothes, homes, and the other items we expect to see. Next, there is music that relays the emotions of characters in the story. Next comes the dialogue which communicates what each character wants in an easy to understand way. Next, it is the villain who likes the world the way it is and defends it against change. Thereafter comes the philosophy of the story-world that dictates the rules everyone in the story is supposed to live by; for example Cinderella is supposed to obey her stepmother. Cinderella is the hero of the story because she disregards the ruling philosophy by fight for a better Life. And at the top of this story pyramid are tools; a catchall term for the real objects, from glass slippers to Death Stars, that are above being regular props because they are the levers of power that control what happens in the story-world.

Storytellers work hard to mix these incredients together. When done properly, the resulting "cake" will transfix audiences and arise strong emotions and lasting commitments because we’ve experienced the Life of another person inside an easy to digest package.

---

And that brings us back to avoiding echo chambers so we can practicelearn mixed-ideological politics.

Dismantling echo chambers starts by realizing _Cinderella_ isn't about a girl abused by her evil step-family. The fairytale is also not about a girl overcoming her evil step-family to marry her prince charming.

The story of _Cinderella_ is about a girl overcoming her antagonistic step-family using levers of powers, i.e. tools.

If Cinderella doesn't get the horses, carriage, and evening dress from her Fairy Godmother, she'll never get into the ball. If the Prince didn't find her lost slipper, she'd never see him again. If the imprisoned girl's allies didn't steal the key to the attic, she'd never get out in time. And if Cinderella didn't have the second glass slipper, her name would be famous as a tragedy instead of a fairytale.

Cinderella had a problem. It wasn't that her step-family were tyrants or that the rules of society were unjust. Cinderella's problem was that her terrible step-family controlled the tools Cinderella needed to improve her life.

From _Star Wars_, to _The Matrix_, to _Cinderella_ all stories start with a group of people controlling the tools while creating a ruling philosophy to explain their control. The hero encounters a problem and reaches for a tool to solve it. Antagonists reveal themselves by preventing access to the important tools to defend their power base. The drama of the story is heroes and villains battling to control the tools needed to change the world. The winner changes, or reaffirms, the world in their image.

Notice the ruling philosophy has a public face. When the stepmother rips Cinderella's gown, locks her in the attic, and destroys the slipper, she's using tools to alter the world in a consistent way, letting us see the philosophy of oppression in her heart.

Yet, the stepmother would not admit her abuse. She'd tell outsiders, and likely even herself, that Cinderella is loved and well cared for. If asked why her stepdaughter is working so hard or absent from the ball, the stepmother would tell a story to hide her true intentions.

The truth is the stepmother favoured her daughters and thus didn't want Cinderella to compete with them. When Cinderella went along with her stepmother's wishing, she was wearing a mask of oppression, which sadly, can win the race of evolution (for now).

![Masked and antagonsit](/assets/problem-solving-philosophy.png)
_Masks of oppression often becomes the face we wear._

If a doctor insists on an ineffective treatment, or martial arts coach advises a bad technique, they are corrupt. The stepmother was corrupt for the same reason. Authority is only valid when it empower its followers evolution. Why would Life give authority that harmed it's own evolution?

That's why like all heroes, Cinderella's dreams only came true when she grabbed the tools needed to solve her pains.

Another important thing to learn from stories is that once they end, the hero and villian are no longer main characters. We don't need to hear from Cinderella after she marries the Prince because "they lived happily ever after". As for the stepmother, she has no more tools to attack Cinderella with, and is thus no longer a threat worthy of attention.

Tools being levers of power, how we use our tools being our true philosophy, and main characters having a limited shelf-life, are the facts those who sell themselves, their ideology, and their tools as being the eternal single source of truth that will solve all your problems, don't like.

## Conclusions Bring Mixed Ideological Politics

Despite the emotions over gender pronouns, what to call Christmas, and other culture wars content, today's fiery politics is about resources. Try to support many gender pronouns while wearing a t-shirt that says shut down all universities. Try going to a Trump rally with a sign that says "end the oil age".

You won't be welcomed in either group for the same reason boxers can't choke each other. Because at the end of the day, people aren't ideologies. They are biological beings that need food, water, shelter and therefore have bills to pay, and thus need someone to buy the techniques and tools they know how to use.

Like the stepmother, there is a growing divide between personas and actions in politics. Religious Conservatives find little time for charity, and environmental Progressives who fly around the world need something to obscure their hypocracy. They use each other and give a spectacular performance. Ideologues only talk about things like justice, liberty, history, culture to appeal to their audience's personal tastes. In reality they only want to close a sale on their aging selection of tools.

The giveaway is the lack of conclusions.

Echo chambers don't like conclusions because they force reflection on whether the hero, his philosophy, and his chosen tools changed the world or not. For example, if a fighter gets choked unconscious in a mixed-martial arts fight, he must reflect on his tactics the same way Cinderella did after her dress was torn to shreds.

However, today's ideologues are not Cinderella, mixed-martial artists, or doctors searching for the best possible tools and techniques needed to win your fight. Rather, ideologues like the "liberal professor" and "outcast conservative professor" are old martial arts teachers selling their limited tools and techniques.

Remember, it was only when curious fighters said, "what discipline is best?" and engaged in real fights and listened to their pains, that martial artists realized no discipline can be the single-source of truth.

A mix-and-match philosophy turns people into heroes. Because tools can't be perfect or evil. They are inanimate. Like the glass slippers, they only hold value if they can help solve a problem. And that's what heroes makes a hero, someone setting out to solve _their_ problems.

To escape echo chambers, embrace Techvolution and its mixed-ideological politics. Only then will you search out the mixture of tools you need to find your niche. All you need to do is understand when a mixed-martial arts enters a boxing gym, he's not being disloyal to his wrestling coach. When a family doctor refers you to a physiotherapist, she's not being disloyal to medical doctors. When a biologist says "I don't know, ask a neuroscientist" she's not being a bad biologist. This is because these fields understand they are sub-disciplines that exists to help a person solve a problem.

Fighters overcome opponents. Patients battle diseases. Cinderella had an evil stepfamily.

What's your problem?

- Is your job not paying enough? You will not be a disloyal Conservative because you joined a union.
- Are customers robbing your store? You will not be a disloyal Progressive for pressing charges.
- Is a bad supply chain increasing your costs? You will not be a disloyal Progressive or Conservative for wanting a robust local supply chain.

You will not be disloyal, because you are not Conservative or Progressive. You're a lifeform looking for resources, it's not your job to judge which techniques and tools you should be loyal to. It's your job to solve your daily pains. And if any stepmother insults, bullies, threatens, or attacks your choice, let them innovate a better one.

Now, what tools do you need to solve your problems?

If you're willing to consider any tool, from a handgun to a solar panel, to solve your problem, you're on the way to mixed-ideological politics. If you think any tool is "off limits", you've been sold a single ideology and are at least partially stuck inside an echo chamber.

You should use mixed-ideological politics to choose any tool. Not only because evolution has proven so succesful in modern medicine and mixed-martial arts, but because selecting any adaptation is your path to the future. Because evolution has no limits, respects no man-made rules, and is the only way to earn your spot on Earth.

## There is No Lion King

We weren't the first species to live on Earth and won't be the last. Life has survived billions of years without depending on any species. There's nothing special about any creature. We each survive and thrive according to the same laws of evolution.

Life needs evolution because the Universe is a hostile place. It's constantly changing as mountains fall apart, volcanoes erupt, stars emit radiation, waves wash away shorelines, and endless more things transform our planet. To respond to a changing environment, Life must evolve new species.

Those who survive do so because their combination of attributes gives them an edge. But, as the planet inevitably changes, traits lose their advantage. Thus, while evolution is a constant race to harvest resources more efficiently, no species ever knows if their list of adaptions is good enough to overcome the problems of its environment. That's why pain hurts so much; it's Life's way of telling individuals to change their behavior and try something else before it's too late.

Evolution has these laws:

 - No species survives forever.
 - All lifeforms have a common ancestry.
 - Evolution of new species is gradual.
 - The number of species always multiplies to fill niches.
 - Natural selection determines which individuals lives on.

These laws oversee every evolutionary race. The competition started after a few amino acids combined to form the first cells 3.6 billion years ago. Since then, evolution has continually created new species. Each is based on the one prior, but each removes or adds traits in a hope of finding an edge. That edge could mean simple improvements like getting bigger or smaller, faster or slower. Or, the edge could be further specialization to find a niche no one else has; such as polar bears being the only seal hunters seals in a frozen ecosystem.

Regardless of what new trait an organism evolves, evolution's selection of the best adaptions requires a daily and hour scrutinizing, throughout the world, of every adaption, even the slightest. The best way to continually test species is with ecosystems. By putting creatures inside a shared environment, there are checks and balances to keep everyone on task. So when any plant, fungus, scavenger, predator, herbivore, or omnivore falls behind, Life can easily reach in the ecosystem and create a new species to take the laggard's place and keep Life playing the game of survival.

![Elephant Speciation](/assets/speciation-elephants.png)
_Here's one example of how a species evolves._

The story of Life is billions of years old, involving trillions of lifeforms. Happily, the pages are very organized. Since Life adapts to its surroundings, we can track evolution using Earth's geological changes. Each period, epoch, and age of Earth's geography, from the Jurassic to the Paleozoic, have different characteristics like concentration of oxygen in the air, amount of water in the oceans, or ice in the poles. These geological changes are chapters in the story of Life.

Because, while Life's evolution was relatively seamless between each chapter, species often had an agonizing time during the transition. Each time Earth's geology transitioned it was like a climactic conclusion asking if an individual's list of adaptations would prosper in the new environment. The few who passed the test climbed the ladder to the next age, while most species went around in circles, stubbornly fighting their inevitable extinction; their existence only remembered as fossils to be may be uncovered one day. 99% of all the species that have lived, are dead.

![Evolutionary Spiral](/assets/speciation-elephants.png)
_The Evolutionary Spiral in the [history of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_evolutionary_history_of_life). From the perspective of Life, it's seamless, but for lifeforms, there are often tragic endings._

It took scientists centuries to demystify the story of Life's evolution, and this summary misses the many details. But the essence is here: Life must adapt new species to Earth's ever-changing environment. The faster the better; the more species the better. No interference is allowed because individuals are the unit of selection. Wherever there's liquid water, an artist named evolution works night and day creating custom lifeforms to harvest every possible ray of sunshine, scap of food, and source of heat. Evolutions's constant stream of creations is the only reason Earth isn't just another rock revolving around a star with no one to notice how beautiful the Universe is.

And now, we understand why echo chambers are doomed. They presume an adaptation can be ever-lasting. They commit themselves to a few techniques and tools and antagonize the creation of new ones by telling stories of their adaptation's supposed perfection. They try to remove the individual as the unit of selection and replace it with a pundit, boss, or bureaucrat.

Life, of course, doesn't care what stories we tell ourselves. Leaving those inside echo chambers to reconcile the ideology they passionately believe in against the pain they feel in the real world as they walk around in circles, finding someone to blame because they're aging adaptations can't harvest enough resources to make their users happy and healthy.

As it's always been, evolution is our way out. Unfettered innovation explains why modern medicine, mixed-martial arts, and fairytale characters like Cinderella are so successful. They let themselves become many species by adapting to their situation. They drop unhelpful tools and pickup useful ones. Their freedom of mind let's them reflect on their progress and make changes before it's too late.

For us to master evolution and use it's incredible power there is one important difference to always keep in mind. Humans do not evolve. Technology does.

<!--  -->
_The anger in politics today is the people living through their adaptations and way of life. We don't have the philotopshy to tell us to drop the old and pickup the new. Our anger in the face of AI shows we are all the polar bear._

## Human Biology is Out, Technology is In

The Boston Symphony had a problem. There was a lot of men in their orchestra and no one knew why. There were plenty of talented female musicians challenging males for orchestra seats, yet not many were making the cut. The auditions were already blind, so the symphony tried asking musicians to take off their shoes before auditioning.

Voilà! Within a few years the orchestra had gender ratio evened out. Evolution gave a standing ovation because anything that gets in the way of the best solution, like gender, is all noise.

Finding the perfect biological adaptation takes a long time. Since organic lifeforms are physically attached to their adaptations, the genetic mutations needed to create new characteristics takes millions of years. But while biological evolution is slow, at least it's inevitable. Genetic mutations happen involuntarily during procreation, so biological innovation is automatic with no interference possible.

There are no stepmothers in the biological evolution of Life.

We humans can't evolve biologically. If we did, then their might be a difference between male and female musicians. But, it's not our genes that change when learning a adaptation like a violin or piano. Instead, we adapt our psychology to incorprate a new tool into our list of traits.

Anyone with enough patience can learn any tool and evolve their skillset.

We are still biological lifeforms, but because we invent new tools, we facilitate Life's evolution with technology instead of biology. There is effectively no difference. Life wants adaptations that consistently collect energy, adapt, and procreate. Life doesn't care about the material composition anymore than a composer or audience cares what gender the orchastra is.

Our technological evolution follows the same laws as regular evolution.

 - No technology survives forever.
 - All technology has a common ancestry.
 - Evolution of new tools is gradual.
 - The number of tools always multiplies to fill niches.
 - Natural selection determines which individual tools/users live on.
 
Thus, we humans are biological vessels for technological evolution. As Cinderella demonstrated our fate is determined by the tools in our hands, not the genes in our cells.

Our evolution requires innovators undertake the burden of inventing new technology, that becomes tools, that effectively becomes a new species once someone uses it. To teach a new adapatation requires lots of information, which is best communicated with a story. Therefore, innovation requires storytelling inside marketing or ideology to connect person and tool.

This is what happened during the creation of judo, boxing, wrestling and the other martial arts. While these disciplines of course don't have much technology, they still use bags, pads, ropes, gloves, weights, books, and eventually video, to train, learn, and pass-on knowledge.

Thus, these martial arts used the human body as a foundation to attach a mixture of techniques and tools, that gave the human body and mind into a variety of distinct traits, and therefore created different species like boxers, judokas, kickboxers, etc.

![Technological Tree of Life](/assets/speciation-elephants.png)
_We live on the technological tree of Life. We live on the same evolutionary tree as biology, but we only operate technology._

Once home televisions and the internet allowed lots of information to flow, it became possible to do what evolution does; review the species, evaluate their strengths and weaknesses, and pick the best based on the requirements of a given fight.

But, while natural selection in biological Life is automatic, it is not for technological Life. For fighters to mix and match the best martial arts techniques required seeing through the stories that connected them to a single self-defense discipline. And seeing through stories isn't our best feature.

Why?

Because by seeing through a story that connects us to a tool, we're doing what Cinderella did and confronting a power structure which typically responds with a self-serving, anti-evolution, story.

_"Cinderella, the ball isn't for you."_
_"Cinderella, clean up, that is your job, because you're the stepdaughter."_
_"Cinderella, you can't try on the glass slipper, because I'm the mother, and I say only my daughters can be a princess."_
_"Cinderella, your pain is invalid, do what you're told to do."_

We can't understand a word of oak tree, dolphine, or any other creatures communication, yet we understand their evolution because we only listen to their actions in their quest to harvest resources and procreate. Because we can understand human language, the natural selection of tools is a confusing mess of real stories about magical new tools and fake reasons of why we shouldn't reach for them told by antagoinsts like the stepmother who don't have to admit evolution has toppled the power structure that gave them their edge.

Today, our society's huge Industral Age ideological echo chambers exist to fight evolution.

And they won't stop getting bigger or nastier because, like it did with biological lifeforms so many times before, evolution has entered a new chapter in the story of Life. This one is called the Internet Age.

## Old Age, Ladder Climb, Final Frontier

In 55 BC, the Roman general Julius Caesar had a problem. German barbarians kept raiding his prosperous territory from across the Rhine river. Caesar defeated the Germans in open battle, but the Germans avoid fighting him. Instead the barbarians used small boats to raid Roman villages in the night.

So, to protect his society, Caesar had to defeat an enemy that wouldn't fight him.

He came up with an idea. The Germans were a tribal people, with no written language, limited metal working, and primitive engineering. Meanwhile, the Romans built excellent roads, long aquaducts, huge colliseums, and seemingly whatever else they wanted.

To showcase their technological power, Caesar decided to build a bridge.

The construction was carried out in an area where the depth of the river would be up to nine meters. The bridge was built on double wooden piles that were driven into the riverbed by winching up a large stone and releasing it, thereby driving the posts into the riverbed. The construction system ensured that the greater the flow of water, the harder the bridge was held together. Caesar’s soldiers built the bridge in just 10 days.

Watching the Roman legions crossing the mighty Rhine river mystified the Germans.

The barbarians struggled getting flimsy boats across the wide river couldn't understand what the heck this "thing" was that let people walk on water. It would be like us today seeing 10,000 people teleport to Mars. We'd be scared (to say the least) because human psychology needs to understand a technology [before we can comfortably use it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZcOKhYI57Y)

Caesar defeated the Germans by educating them about technological evolution. He showcased Roman mastery of the Classic Age, and Germans being hundreds of years behind in the Iron Age. So impressed by Rome's levers of almost magical powers, the Germans made peace that lasted for generations.

We already know biological evolution is tracked in eras like the famous Jurassic period. For humans the chapters of evolution are the ages of new technology. The tools we create, use, and understand determines where we are in the story of Life. Here is a list of all the technological ages, and the civilizations that led humanity to each.

  - Bronze Age: 	  2000 - 1250 (Babylon)
  - Iron Age:  		  1250 - 550  (Greece)
  - Classic Age:  	550 - 476   (Rome)
  - Middle Ages: 	  500 - 1439  (Abbasid)
  - Renaissance: 	  1440 - 1686 (Italy)
  - Science Age: 	  1687 - 1759 (France)
  - Industrial Age: 1760 - 1969 (America)
  - Internet Age: 	1970 -      (tbd)

Like Julius Caesar demonstrated, the difference between technological ages is huge. A fundamental new technology is an entirely new stage of evolution, with a totally different list of traits in the hands of its people. There is no biological difference between peoples in different ages, but their levers of power certainly are different. Going from one chapter to another, like from Bronze to Iron, requires re-inventing and re-learning everything: transportion, agriculture, war, healthcare, music, self-defense, medicine, and everything else that makes up a civilization.

As we already discusssed, biological evolution is slow but involuntary, and thus the biological game of evolution never stops. 

Technological evolution isn't so certain. 

The Germans didn't enter into the Classic Age for hundreds of more years after seeing Caesar's bridge. The Romans themselves stalled their advancement and were invaded and colonized by those very same Germans. Advancing a civilization requires leaving the old one behind, which for many nations is so hard, it never happens.

A big reason for this is the loyalty stories foster in humanity. Stories are meant to pass-on knowledge to aid everyone's continuous evolution. But the people in power use stories to distract regular people from evolving new tools, because new tools have new power bases.

America won the Industrial Age. It did so with a mixture of hardwork, ingenuity, and injustice. And, in 1970, America invented the personal computer and the internet. This is the technology of the future, but we are not yet in the Internet Age for the same reasons seeing the bridge didn't upgrade the German barbarians all those years ago.

Evolving our society to the possibilities of modern technology requires calling "bullshit" on our Industrial Age power brokers. Their screams about "wokeness" and "fascists" are only meant to keep us in the Industrial Age while laying blame for the social, economic, and political problems that inevitable get worse when any creature stops playing the game of evolution.

<Flipper1970 />

_Ignoring evolution has us walking in circles inside a death spiral._

## Building the Bridge

Once you realize humans must evolve but can't evolve biologically, this new philosophy falls into place: technological evolution is the plot of human existence. But the storytelling that connects us to good tools also keeps us loyal to old ones. So, we're often masked from the fact our only path to success is dropping old ways of Life and starting anew.

Once our food, shelter, water, security are secure, our biology tells us to defend what we have. The well-fed polar bears aren't the ones looking for new food sources. Thus, each person who gets paid via Industrial Age tools instinctually antagonizes new tools. We thus have lots of stepmothers in our body politic.

Industrial Age way of life is based around technology like broadcast radio and television, school libraries and lecture halls, corporate offices and meeting rooms, car and truck transportation, suburban housing and home remodeling, and so on down the mass-marketing list. All these one-size-fits-all adaptations are past their shelf-life and are no longer levers of power empowering users to climb ladders in the game of evolution.

So we don't climb the ladder to the Internet Age.

Instead, we continue industrializing society with too many large roads, cars, homes, planes, televisions, one-time-use products, and other mass-produced industrial goods. Regular people are left being Cinderella locked in the attic, wanting a better Life without knowing how to get it. Without the power of evolution in their minds, they must tell stories within either Conservative or Progressive ideology to justify why they should get priority access to the dwindling carcass of the Industrial Age.

- Hi, I'm a Progressive Activist. My creativity imagined the Industrial Age policies and tools that spread unimaginable wealth to humankind. After the Industrial Age ended in 1969, I kept selling those same tools and policies and now they're totally bizarre. That's why my art films, marketing campaigns, and protests are a terrible return on investment. I used easy credit and cheap labor to sustain my adaptations since the 1970s, but they're both running out. To hide my ineffectiveness, I've been using a justice-loving public philosophy that because my, or someone else, parents and grandparents were abused and disadvantaged, I should still get the money I need to pay my mortgage and grocery bills. By the way, Fascist Conservatives are greedy and evil. They deserve nothing!

- Hi, I'm a Conservative Businessman. My industriousness built the Industria Age's companies, tools, and wealth for mankind. After the Industrial Age ended in 1969, I kept selling the same tools and companies using flashy spectacle. American homes, vehicles, and televisions are now enormous! They do the same functions, though, so we had to use easy credit and cheap labor to pay for it all, and now it's running out. To hide my years of ineffectiveness, I've been using a liberty-loving public philosophy. Because my parents or grandparents were intelligent and hard-working, I should still get the money to pay my mortgage and grocery bills. By the way, Socialist Woke Progressives are lazy and evil. They deserve nothing!

- I don't like politics. But as the cost of living rates go up, I'm looking for answers. I'm starting to think `insert name here` people are terrible, so I'm joining `insert name here.` My unspoken concern is that the technology that underpins my job is becoming obsolete, which sucks because I was planning on working at Blockbuster forever. I love Netflix by the way, what are you watching?

- None of us knows how to start a web server.

We're an Industrial Age species trying to live in the Internet Age. As a result our real-life problems are mounting like they are for the polar bears. Sadly, the chance to bring our debt, inflation, insurance, and the cost of living rates<button @click="rdegg = !rdegg">*</button>down proactively and ease ourselves into the next chapter in the story of Life, has passed.

Life has let 99% of all prior species die because they failed to harvest enough resources to procreate. Anyone who refuses to adapt themselves to the possibilities of new technology and instead follows, protests, invests in Industrial Age ideologies, cultures, and societies is writing themselves on that list.

You don't have to join them.

Techvolution was written to individuals because individuals are evolution's unit of selection. Tall, short, Nigerian, Japanese, rich, poor, it doesn't matter what group you were in the past. Whoever adopts mixed-ideological politics climbs the ladder to the Internet Age selects themselves into the future.

Once you upgrade your politics with techvolultion and its mixed-ideological politics you'll escape the attic and build the bridge to the Internet Age. Once there, you'll notice how many wonderful Internet Age tools, techniques, and products already exist. Many inventors have used up their soul in garages, basements, and weekend all nighters creating incredibly cool Internet Age technology.

Bumble-bee economics is ready, it just needs you to polinate it.

The Internet Age has billions of products. No single ideology can filter them for you. You are unique. You need to mix modern tools and find which modern tools solve your frontline pains. Keep reading and you will learn how open-source software, and interoperable technology standards will put wealth generating power in your, and everyone elses, hands

Tools like Git, Ruby on Rails, USB, Linux, and so much more are waiting for you to discover your niche.

Evolution is inevitable. Techvolution, mixed-martial politics, and bumble-bee economics are going to happen; Jeff Goldblum says so. Why would anyone not follow him?

>If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that Life will not be contained. Life breaks free. It expands to new territories. It crashes through barriers. Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is....Life...finds a way.

[Ian Malcolm, Jurassic Park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiVVzxoPTtg)

I wish this summary was original. It's actually a remake.

Years ago, our ancestors had to evolve from the Medieval Age. Meaning they had to leave behind the Catholic and Protestant political philosophy that said God wanted kings and queens to rule countries forever. If ever there was a public-facing philosophy designed to hold back everyone's evolution, it was the idea that princes always make for good leaders.

Conservative and Progressive philosophers worked hard to detach Catholic and Protestant political theology from daily politics. Conservative and Progressive created religious tolerance that allowed Industrial Age people to mix and match their religious beliefs. Mixed religious tolerance brought about the separation of church and state. Catholics and Protestants were free to work together to great mutual benefit during the Industrial Age via their shared ideology of capitalism.

Capitalism, of course, had a competitor, communism. Capitalism won because it unknowingly harnessed evolution. Its free-market principles empowered evolution's game pieces, individuals, to be humanity's unit of selection. By allowing individuals to buy and sell products, capitalism allowed technology to multiply or die based on which tools best solved frontline pains.

Communism was different. It empowered ideologically educated intermediaries to decide what tools and techniques strangers needed in their fight to survive. The communist dream joined the 99% of all species that are dead.

Old philosophers didn't know about evolution. Capitalism unknowingly harnessed evolution, while communism unknowingly ignored it. Techvolution takes some of what worked in old philosophies and includes the lessons of technological evolution.

Battling Conservatives and Progressives will work together peacefully once they adopt ideological tolerance via Techvolution and its mixed-ideological politics. Since we know about evolution, our (and future) upgrades should be more straightforward. And it's not a moment too soon. Because it took many years of horrible warfare for Catholics and Protestants to leave the past behind. 

When the ashes had settled, they wrote a new shared vision for society inside our Constitutions and Bills of Rights. These facilitated technological evolution by empowering frontline pain over any man-made authority by making government answerable to regular people via regular elections. And just as essential, individuals had the right to buy and sell wealth-generating tools. 

As it does for all creatures, Mother Nature decided individual freedom works, and America won the Industrial Age in the game of evolution.

As for our problems with capitalism today. We only have to realize that capitialism only allowed technology to multiply or die based frontline pains at home. Not at work.
