## Mixed Ideological Politics

>I thought you guys would like to hear this story. I know my fellow wrestlers know exactly what I'm talking about. A martial art is either real or it's not. Very early on in the sport of mixed-martial arts, when the logical assumption from the marketing team is that you're going to get every taekwondo student, every karate student, every judo practitioner, and every aikido and they're just going to absolutely love mixed-martial arts.

>It ended up being the absolute opposite.

>All of those arts that I just named that, turned out to not be real, or at least real in terms of their effectiveness in actual combat, steered as far away from mixed-martial arts as they could. They begged their students not to watch. Found a number of different reasons why mixed-martial arts is too violent or too, whatever their excuse was.

>Because the practioners of old martial arts didn't like what they were finding out. They had bought into it. They had spent their life. They had mastered some of these old martial arts movements. To only find out that it was a waste of time.

Are you sick of today's politics? The ranting and raving. The endless half-truths and memes that only serve to entrench already held beliefs. This books feels your pain. It's geared to the moderate middle who want politics to be about rational problem-solving instead of self-indulgent mudslinging.

Solving your pain is what this book is all about.

To fight pain we humans develop things. We change government policies to direct our resources in better ways. We invent tools to solve our problems with lasting solutions. And, we learn new ideas to expand our minds.

Whatever we develop, we do it to solve our pain.

Martial arts is a great example of this quest. Karate, kickboxing, taekwondo, wrestling, aikido, jiu-jitsu, judo, and boxing are our most popular self-defense disciplines. To subdue an opponent each of them teach a set of techniques and creates rules that say only their techniques are allowed; there's no kicking in a boxing match for example.

The world's martial arts co-existed for many years. Inside the disciplines, teachers happily taught their chosen techniques to the next generation. Practioners would train almost everyday. The best students would compete in tournaments, get scholarships, and strive to become world champions. And, believers of a martial art would congregate around experts, tournaments, and the latest news.

But never would these martial arts fight across disciplines.

However, in the late 1980s, as home televisions spread information across the world, once isolated fighting cultures started to open up. People got curious. Fighters started to ask themselves, "which martial art is best?"

Would a boxer beat a kickboxer? What would happen if a wrestler fought a karate guy? Many people starting ask what if martial artists threw away the rule books and fought a real fight.

In the early 1990s, the questions stopped, and the fighting started. At first called Vale Tudo, then Ultimate Fighting, martial artists from every discipline fought in fights with no rules. Finally, the world's fighting masters could prove their martial art was the best on Earth!

And the winner of the best martial art was...

All of them are.

And none of them. 

This revelation surprised everyone. The martial arts community assumed one discipline would reign supreme. But that wasn't the case because each discipline had a limited toolbox of techniques. Sometimes those techniques were very effective in a real fight; like Brazilian jit jitsu's submissions, or wrestling's dominate control. But many techniques like karate's katas, taekwondo's flashy high-kicks, boxing's obesssion with standing toe-to-toe and swinging for a knockout were easily countered and therefore not effective.

After several years of fighting in "no rules" martial arts tournaments it became clear that some martial art disciplines were more effective than others, but each had drawbacks and none was complete. As Ultimate Fighting kept on growing in popularity during the 1990s and 2000s, it forced the martial art communities to reflect on their techniques and beliefs.

As said in the opening quote, many practioners, referees, coaches, and pundits (especially from the least effective disciplines) choose to retreat back into their sub-cultures because they, "didn't like what they were finding out."

Fortunately, many fighters embraced the effectual truth revealed by Ultimate Fighting. And so, the world of martial arts started to get all mixed up.

Some kickboxers started to train submissions. Wrestlers learned some punching. Masters in one discipline started as eager newbies in another. Eventually, after several years of watching, learning, and participating in the cross-pollination of techniques, these fighters evolved skills far beyond their old martial arts teachers and disciplines.

Listening to their physical pain of failure with a newly open mind, martial artists adopted evolution's philosophy of "adapt or die." Human self-defense finally learned what every lifeform on Earth knows; there is no rulebook.

No deer in the world depends on a judge to save it when fighting off a bear, as no bear depends on a pundit declaring it the winner to get its next meal.

Just like in Nature, the best martial art technique is entirely dependant on ones's opponent and surroundings while measuring the risks and rewards of the fight. Whatever techniques are most efficient to win the fight are the best.

Before Ultimate Fighting, all fighters were puting the horse before the cart, so to speak. They had the answers before knowing the problem. Martial arts students were tricked into thinking fights are won or lost according to man-made rules governeed by teachers, pundits, and judges instead of real-world results. 

Despite sometimes getting beaten black and blue, martial artists were never stupid. Their fault is quite human; they fell prey to good storytelling. 

Quality storytelling is why so many devoted boxers, judokas, and other practioners were so easily misled by their respective discipline. Filled with history, culture, traditions isolated martial art disciplines acted like echo chambers with a reality so complete, it tricked people into believing it was the single source of truth.

Once martial artists opened their minds, they started fighting for themselves. Fighters quickly realized the rules of boxing, kickboxing, wrestling, etc., were excellent for honing their chosen techniques but were also artificial and must be forgotten when preparing for an actual fight.

When fighters customized their techniques to the problems faced in a fight, evolution became their instructor and the community entered a brave new world. 

A world of remarkable progress. With an open mind and access to the world's information on the internet, fighters improved themselves by leaps and bounds every year. Kickboxers became wrestlers, Jiu-jitsu black belts learned high-kicks. The individual disciplines brought their techniques to an open marketplace of ideas.

With evolution as their teacher, these new martial artists started to listen to their bodies instead of other peoples stories. The speed of victories, and the less pain suffered in winning them, was the best judge, teacher, and pundit of what's the best fighting philosophy. The top martial arts trainers were the ones who helped their students adapt faster. Evolution happened during training and even in real-time during a fight.

This new evolutionary fighting philosophy was so successful it created a new way for humans to think of self-defense called mixed-martial arts.

In mixed-martial arts, fighters don't limit themselves within the confines of an artificial rulebook. Everyone should learn a little from every discipline. The best technique is the one that brings results. So devoted to evolution, mixed-martial artists want everyone to improve because, "iron sharpens iron".

Mixing the human body's adaptability with a free mind created a new, self-correcting, and sustainable martial art. Today, even a moderately skilled mixed-martial artist is an overwhelming favorite against a champion of any single fighting discipline. Just as important, since mixed-martial arts includes all techniques, any person, whether short or tall, heavy or thin, aggressive or meek, can find their niche and learn to win a fight. 

And finding a niche is what evolution is all about. By empowering anyone and everyone, mixed-martial arts is the ultimate fighting philosophy.

On our journey to improve our politics, here's the lessons we should take from the story of mixed-martial arts.

Today, in the early 21st century, the middle-class has many systematic problems. Taxes get more confusing. School prepares students less for the job market. Insurance gets more expensive. And there are many more topics trending badly.

We all want better for ourselves and our kids. People sellling their politics say they can improve the economy, and so the worst things get, the more sales these ideologues close. As a result, many people today think being "political" means supporting a single ideology of "red", "blue", "green" and so on. With the enthusiasm of a new product in hand, these newly political people back one ideology by donating time and money, buying books, following pundits, going to rallies, and...

We keep getting our asses kicked in our real lives.

Like old martial artists who believed their chosen discipline was the single source of truth, the middle-class keeps losing because we believe in _one_ ideology and wrongfully think our jobs, paychecks, and happiness are governed by its rulebook.

As our economy keeps getting worse, the more people buy into one ideology's storytelling. Once inside, people are stuck in a self-reinforcing spiral. Army ants have something similar when a group gets cut off form the main foraging party. In isolation each ant follows the scent trail of the other ant. They go around in a circle until they all die of exhaustion.

Today's political ideologies are in a similar death spiral. Inside echo chambers, teachers, pundits, commentators sell their books, lectures, podcasts to people looking for answers. Just as it for ants, this spiral is hard to break out of beause each ideology is like old martial arts masters telling us stories how their techniques give automatic success. And when we continue to feel the pain of real life problems, we're told the other disciplines are not options because they break the ideological rulebook Or even worse, we're told we must attack other ideologies because the failing economy is _their_ fault.

The truth is, all political ideologies and their economic plans are incomplete.

That's why I wrote _Techvolution_. It helps break any steadfast loyalty you have one ideology and encourages you to realize you're a lifeform in Nature, and thus the only rules and techniques that matter are those that help you solve your specific and unique real life problems.

Nature is a street fight, and evolution is the only teacher you need.

With this freedom of mind to mix and match ideologies you'll overcome any political or economic problem. Be it a dreadful morning commute, rising climate change, or debilitating government bureaucracy. This new philosophy might be called mixed-ideological politics.

Seeing through the death spiral of today's ideological echo chambers isn't easy. The storytelling Twitter feeds, cable news, dinner table arguments is persuasive, and even comforting to people scared of the future. To see above today's political noise and salesmanship requires a solid understanding of storytelling. One you got that, you'll avoid being sucked into the false security of ideological echo chambers.

Once you're protected from ideological stortelling, you can adopt mixed-ideological politics. After reading this book, you'll be as powerful in your politics as a mixed-martial artist is in a fight.

* Note: if you're so curious, we analyze storytelling more indepth in _Story-Cut Tools_.

## Echo Chambers Are Needed, Until They're Not

- Remember we're not erasing ideologies.

Before we learn to protect ourselves from the echo chambers, it's important to always keep in mind, we're not erasing ideologies. We're only empowering ourselves to be like mixed-martial artists and mix and match ideologies to solve our problems.

Some may be doubting our society can follow martial arts and embrace mixed-ideological politics. I know we can, because we do it in so many areas. Here's another a field which has adopt a similarly enlightened philosophy.

Modern medicine has many disciplines and specialists. Some are based on cutting edge research, others on old school remedies. In the past, when isolated by geography and culture, people would be bound to do what the local healer or doctor prescribed. But today, you would never go to one medical professional, expecting them to be a master of every possible health problem.

There's simply too many human health problems for any one medical discipline to master.

That's why all medical professionals today, from hemopathic healers to neural surgeons, are recognized as sub-disciplines with their own techniques, cultures, and rulebooks. Every medical professional is allowed to say its strengths and weaknesses and admit its a niche and not the single source of truth. The skill in practicing modern medicine is mixing disciplines to solve a patients pain as quickly as possible. While modern medicine certainly isn't perfect (especially its administration), it's nearly magical when compared the times when surgeons didn't santize their tools and doctors used one-size fits all solutions like leeches. Modern medicine and mixed-martial arts improved so quickly because they are enlightened and therefore limiting individual fighters, or patients, pain is their ultimate sign of success or failure.

That book does the same for politics.

If a person can train using different fighting techniques from many multiple martial arts disciplines, and doctors can refer their patients to specialists from other disciplines, why can't we also be self-aware enough, and respectful enough, to mix and match ideologies according to their strengths and weaknesses in solving a specific problem?

To enlighten our politics in such a way, we only have to accept no ideology is complete. Like in medicine or Ultimate Fighting, any ideological technique must be evaluated based on evidence of their real-world results and not ideological purity.

The biggest obstacle to mixed-ideological politics is the same as it was for mixed-martial arts. Ideological pundits, teachers, and commentators see their beliefs and techniques as the single source of truth. Such a outlook can never embrace being just another niche a person could try. To avoid the open competition of natural selection, ideologues ramp up their storytelling.

To escape their spell of ideological echo chambers, we must understand the magic of great stories.

## Cinderella

- how to see through echo chambers so we can mix and match them.

The classic fairytale _Cinderella_ is a great example of how to hook an audience.

The movie tells the story of a beautiful, diligent, and kind-hearted country girl who lives with her cruel step family. An unloved orphan, she is forced to do all the chores and serve her wicked stepmother and her two spoiled stepsisters. Cinderell's made friends with the local animals, but dreams of a better life and a chance to find happiness.

She’s ecstatic when she learns that the King is holding a grand celebration to find a bride for his charming son. Cinderella's friends help her sew a dress for what's sure to be the most wonderful night of her life. But her evil family forbids her, mocks her uppitiness, and tears her dress to shreds.

The young country girl is on the verge of tears. But just as despair is about to set in, her fairy godmother appears. With a flick of her wand, the godmother transforms Cinderella’s ragged clothes into a dazzling gown and a pair of sparkling glass slippers. The fairy's magic also creates a carriage and a team of horses so that her goddaughter will finally have a night she’ll never forget.

At the party, Cinderella captivates everyone with her beauty and grace, especially the Prince. The two glide across the floor and whisper sweet nothings in each other’s ears. Sadly, the spell that gave Cinderella her magical night ends, forcing the shy orphan to flee from the ballroom, leaving the Prince with nothing but a glass slipper to remember her by.

The heartbroken Prince is determined to find his true love and orders his men to search the entire kingdom for the girl who fits the slipper.

They eventually get to Cinderella’s house. The wicked stepmother has gotten wise that her stepdaughter is the Prince’s heartthrob, and so locks her in the attic. Cinderella's friends who come to her rescue and steal the key and open the attic door just in time for Cinderella to ask the Prince’s men if she can try on the glass slipper. Then, just as she’s about to, the evil stepmother smashes the precious mememto.

To which Cinderella responds by revealing she has the other slipper.

And the rest is history.

The movie _Cinderella_ was very popular when it was released. It's popular today. And it'll be popular hundreds of years from now when humanity is (hopefully) travelling the stars. People will always like it because everyone can sympathize with a warm hearted person overcoming obstacles and bullies, to improve her life

People love stories. We can't get enough of them. A good story lets us experience the trials, lessons, and drama of another person. From horrible brushes with death, to whimsical romances, stories pass on the experience of many lives during our limited time on Earth.

Stories are so powerful because they create a complete reality. This starts with the props that fill the storyworld with items, from cups to homes, we expect to see in any world. Next, there is music to relay the emotions of characters in the story. The dialogue of the story communicates what each character wants in an easy to understand way. Then there's the villain who earns their title because he likes the world the way it is and defends it against change. Next comes the philosophy of the story world that dictates the rules everyone in the story is presumed to live by, for example Cinderella is a child who's supposed to obey her stepmother. Cinderella defines what a hero is by disrearding the ruling philosphy and envisioning a better world for herself. And at the top of this story pyramid are tools; a catchall term for the real objects, from slippers to Death Stars, that are above being regular props, because they are the levers of power that control what happens in the story world.

The magic of good storytelling is mixing these incredients together. When done properly, the resulting "cake" will transfix audiences and arise strong emotions and lasting commitments.

---

And that brings us back to echo chambers and our need to escape today's ideological ones.

Dismantling echo chambers starts by realizing the story of _Cinderella_ isn't about a girl controlled by her evil step-family. The fairytale is also not about a girl overcoming her evil step-family to marry her prince charming.

The story of _Cinderella_ is about a girl overcoming her step-family using levers of powers, i.e. tools.

If Cinderella doesn't get the horses, carriage, and evening dress from her fairy godmother, she'll never get into the ball. If the Prince didn't find her lost slipper, she'd never see him again. If the imprisoned girl's allies didn't steal the key to the attic, she'd never get out in time. And if Cinderella didn't have the second glass slipper, her name would be famous as a tragedy instead of a fairytale.

Cinderella had a problem, and it wasn't that her step-family were terrible people, it was that her terrible step-family controlled the tools Cinderella needed to improve her life.

Tools are the lever of power in every story. From _Star Wars_ to _The Matrix_, stories start with the villians controlling the tools while using the ruling philosophy to justify their control. The hero suffers an injustice that lets them see a problem with the ruling philosophy. The drama of the story is heroes and villains battling to control the tools needed to change the world. The winner implements their philsophy and changes or reaffirms the world in their image.

If you were to draw our Cinderlla, this is what it looks like.

- Starting Reality - Cinderella is an orphane living with a hateful stepfamily.
- Hero insight - Cinderella decides to disobey her cruel stepmother and attend the ball.
- Back and forth drama - Cinderella, stepmother, and and their respective allies, battle to control evening ware, invitations, attic keys, glass slippers, and other levers of power.
- New reality - The winner, Cinderella, marries her prince charming and becomes a princess.

Notice that how a person uses a lever of power reveals their true philosophy. For example, even though the stepmother says she cares for Cinderella, when she rips Cinderella's gown, locks her in the attic, and destroys the slipper, she's implementing her philosophy with tools, letting us see the ideology of oppression in her heart.

To showcase how tools determine one's philosophy, think of Cinderella locked inside the dusty and cramped attic. The Prince's men are looking for her and if she can try on the slipper, her horrible life will change forever. So, what if her friends failed getting the key to her prison but got her a match?

Now the oppressed girl has some soul searching to do. A match could get the Prince's mens attention, but the philsophy of possibly buring the house down with it, even to earn her freedom, is a different philosophy then getting some friends to steal a key and open a door. The effects our tools have in the world determines the philosophy we believe in.

Another important thing to learn from stories is that once they end, the hero and villian are no longer main characters. We don't need to hear from Cinderella after she marries the Prince because "they lived happily ever after". As for the stepmother, she's been defeated and is thus no longer a threat worthy of attention.

Tools being levers of power, philosophy being a reflection of tools, and main characters having a limited shelf-life, are the facts those who sell themselves, and their philosophy, as being the eternal single source of truth that will solve all your problems, don't like.

## Mixed Ideologies Come By Ending Stories

- echo chambers end when we change tools, so we automatically mix and match them when we change tools.

>That's hardly a scientific observation Commander.

>Caption, the most elementary and valuable statement in science, the beginning of wisdom is, "I do not know". I do not know what this is sir.

_Data_ [Star Trek](https://youtu.be/8eDYVtPwWiM)

When someone is telling you a story, and the hero and villian, and their philosophies, never go into the sunset, you're being sold an echo chamber. You are being told a unnatural story because there is no conclusion; just endless pages waiting to be filled with your time and money.

Echo chambers don't like conclusions because they force an assessment on whether the hero, his philosophy, and his chosen tools, succeeded or failed in changing the world. Today's ideologues are not idealic philosopers searching for the meaning of life or asking what is justic. The are salesman, creating urgency so the public buys their chosen tools and techniques.

Because political ideolgues want their tools to be society's levers of power.

So, how do you mix and match ideologies?

Remember the rules of storytelling. Cinderella didn't change her philosophy, she grab tools that solved her problem and changed her world. So to escape echo chambers, all you must do is change tools based on their effectivenss in solving your problem. At first this will seem weird and disloyal.

It's not.

When a mixed-martial arts enters a boxing gym, he's not being disloyal to his kickboxing coach. When a family doctor refers you to a physiotherapist, she's not disloyal to medical doctors. This is because both fields understand fighters and patients are the heroes, who should use any lever of power to solve their problem.

Fighters overcome opponents. Patients battle diseases. Cinderella had a stepfamily.

What's your problem? And what tools do you need to solve it.

If you're willing to use any tool, you're free minded. If you think any tool is "off limits", you believe in an echo chamber. As we'll see, evolution has no limits.

Its funny, didn't get "parole", and don't care. I spent my youth unearthing our "non functioning society", and my prime figuring out how to ease the transition to functioning one with rates down implementing Nature's currency. Now people are (finally) talking about inflation and rising cost of living all over the world, which could have propelled rd to be the beacon of frontline innovation needed to transition to a functioning society that I wanted it to be. Instead I met soul crushing antagonism, both active and passive. I dreamt up techvolution to be the narrative that explains all this but can't work up the motivation because the path to actualization is yet another face saying innovation is great "except in my backyard, oh btw Biden/Trump are evil". All the while, technologists aren't ready to protect innovation inside a cohesive narrative because they aren't ready to climb the ladder away from consumerism yet. Ashses to ashses, dust to dust I guess.

## Evolution

- changing techniques/tools is evolution. changing tools is technological evolution.

We are humans living on Earth. We weren't here first and perhaps won't be the last. Life has survived on this planet without us for billions of years. There's nothing special about us. We survive and thrive according to the same rules as every other species. 

The Universe is a hostile place for us all. It's always changing, falling apart, colliding together, sending out radiation, sucking away all the heat. Life needs warmth, constancy, and so much here. Earth is the one place we know of that's secure enough to support Life.

Life prospers because it evolves. Evolution looks like.

 - Evolution makes options. subdisciplines.
 - Natural selection picks the best.

It's up to use to realize when we have enough options to start to select from them freely ala mixed-martial arts and doctors and so forth.

...

## Old Age, Ladder Climb, Final Frontier

However, before you can drop and pick up tools willy nilly as the Enlightened representative of Evolution, you must do something truly historic for the good of all humanity.

Climb the ladder...
