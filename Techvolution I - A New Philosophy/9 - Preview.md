## Backpage

If you don't like politics, or you feel pressured to care because politics is everywhere, this book is for you. You don't need to "pick a side" in the Left versus Right war. Instead, you can bypass their feud and learn how to work with people creating a better future for their kids, country, and planet.

You know when a salesman pushes a lousy product, like used car or expensive phone plan. The veteran salesman knows how to oversell the good parts and ignore the bad ones using catchy words and false urgency.

Today's heated politics is the same as salesmanship.

The Right and Left are sales departments of aging products. Everything from SUVs, corporate healthcare, and for-profit prisons on the Right. To the EVs, government healthcare, and university education on the Left. Each side oversells the good parts, plays down the bad, uses catchphrases like "liberty" and "justice" to appeal to their customers, and creates an urgency that it's "use my products, or else the other side will ruin society."

This book will empower you to avoid buying today's toxic politics that's only trying to close a sale. Keep reading, and you'll learn how to use politics to find people who want to buy new tools today so all our kids have a better tomorrow.

## Inner Flap

_Here is where political philosophy enters. People often don't always reason well, but they do always look for a reason—and political philosophy starts from that fact. In America today, Progressives argue that wealth is unjustly distributed, for example, but they overlook the need to generate wealth. Conservatives do the reverse; preoccupied with wealth generation, they pay little attention to how it should be distributed._

_A partisan difference like this one is not a clash of "values," with each side blind to the other and with no way to decide between them. A competent judge could ask both sides why they omit what they do, and he could supply reasons even if the parties could not. Such a judge is on the way toward political philosophy._

Harvey C. Mansfield, _A Student's Guide to Political Philosophy_

---

People who shop at Whole Foods are already sold on fair-trade coffee. People who buy a gas SUV will reject climate change. Anyone subscribed to Martha Stewart Living is always looking to renovate their home.

The Right and Left both want to sell their chosen products. But they don't go out and say that because they have thousands of products in their catalog. The only way to sell each of them is to use philosophy. Because like with an brand, once a person buys into a philosophy, they will sell themselves on the tools and techniques of its unique way of thinking.

Political philosophy is a long and complicated road, but it's fair to say the Right believes in Conservative philosophy written by [Edmund Burke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Burke) in 1806. The Left believes in the Progressive philosophy that [John Stuart Mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill) wrote in 1859.

Conservative and Progressive philosophies were invented in the early Industrial Age to help our very poor ancestors concentrate enough wealth to build the first mills and factories and distribute the resulting products to overcome everyone's extreme poverty.

They did it!

Which is why the politics wasn't so heated in the past. Both sides were selling the first trains, cotton clothes, textbooks, and so much more stuff that often sold itself.

But, now we have neither primitive steam-powered factories nor mass hunger, illiteracy, and disease in Western societies (if you feel the reflex to talk about all the poor people in the world today, that is okay, but still marvel at the fact in the 1800s, almost all persons lived in poverty and there was no one to blame or send help).

Today's Conservatives and Progressives fight so much because their Industrial Age products, and therefore their Industrial Age philosophies, are out of date. Their time has passed. They mock the other's datedness for entertainment because that's the only way to maintain their own believers' loyalty and attract new buyers. Their sales pitch has devolved into "The Right is concentrating too much wealth!" or "The Left is distributing too much wealth!" to which the other side screams to its followers, "That's what we're supposed to be doing! Keep going! Don't them _them_ stop us!"

And both sides are correct.

If we were in the Industrial Age and trying desperately to keep factories from going broke or ending yet another cholera epidemic (both were common). But we're in the Internet Age with robotics, clean energy, 5G internet, and other technology that can easily generate and distribute wealth. Yet, because we're using Conservativism and Progressivism to wield Internet Age tools, our current problem is too much wealth concentration (i.e., thousands of billionaires) and too much wealth distribution (i.e., printing money).

This book introduces Techvolution.

It is a new philosophy combining Progressivism and Conservatism's best into an improved and updated package. Techvolution does what both sides want by generating wealth easily and distributes it fairly by harnessing Internet Age technology like apps, blockchain, and AI that puts the power of wealth generation into each person's hands.

Only a new philosophy rises above the hatred between Conservatives and Progressives. By removing the cobwebs of their long history, we can remind everyone that feeling hate and placing blame for our problems doesn't change our fate. We are creatures in Nature, and as it does for all species, Life demands we evolve solutions to our problems using new and improved adaptations.

We either use modern technology to innovate a new Internet Age society proactively under the direction of this new way of thinking or, after many depressions, wars, and revolutions, gradually teach us the lessons reason wasn't able to.

## Note to the Reader

To teach humanity about our own evolution, Techvolution uses Aristotle's _Poetics_ to better understand Hegelian dialectics to showcase how humanity continues Life's Darwinian evolution via technological innovation. That's a mouthful, so it's easier to say this new philosophy explains why the politics inside our families, workplace, governments, and societies are (and have always been) best understood as another story in Life's long and ongoing evolution.

I wrote a deep dive in a book called [_Story Cut Tools_](https://storycuttools.netlify.app/), which is a good read but also long. I wrote a summary below with enough meat so you can skip the nerdy philosophical details and jump right into a new philosophy. It will put the power of evolution in your hands so you can evolve a better Life for your kids today.

## Evolution

As you read this, a penguin is diving for fish, an ant colony is raiding its neighbor, a polar bear is stalking a seal, and trillions more lifeforms are battling for survival.

Living in the wild is tough, but many creatures struggle extra hard today. The environment is changing fast. Among other things, forests, greenfields, and ice caps are disappearing. That means lifeforms such as polar bears have increasingly unhelpful adaptations. They still have Life's burning desire to survive and procreate, but their form of white coat and colossal bulk is losing its once mighty advantage to kill seals in the pack ice.

What would you tell a polar bear if you could communicate with her?

Wouldn't it be nice to explain that since the environment always changes, Life must always evolve lifeforms with new traits. Traits are the expressions of genes, which are passed on from parents to offspring during reproduction. Thus, Life on Earth is a constant race. The organisms that harvest calories the fastest, while suffering the least pain, pass on their genes more often. Over time, this turnover of genes innovates new lifeforms and keeps evolution going.

If we could educate the polar bear about evolution, she would know her place in the story of Life. She could then assess what innovations polar bears need to prosper in the Artic's new warmer environment. Perhaps male polar bears should help raise and protect their cubs. Or polar bears should hunt in packs to kill reindeer. Maybe the mighty flesh eaters should go south and diversify their diet with berries, grubs, and roots.

Whatever new traits polar bears will eventually find, if they knew about evolution, they could roll their own dice until they find the adaptations they need to bring prosperity. At least by understanding how evolution works, polar bears wouldn't feel so frustrated as they walk in circles today, struggling to find seals in a changed environment.

We know the future of polar bears because paleontologists, biologists, genealogists, and other specialists have mapped millions of species' habits, linages, and physiologies. This extensive knowledge lets scientists inform humanity about the history, status, and future of many creatures.

Here's a question: Do we know our fate like we know the polar bears? Given how much anger, angst, and confusion we have in our politics, the answer is no.

This book will teach you about human evolution. Our story is the same as all other lifeforms. The environment is constantly changing, thus Life is always looking for updated adaptations. Humans cannot escape evolution's requirement to harvest enough resources to keep Life procreating and therefore evolving.

We think we understand Life's requirement to evolve. Almost every leader, company, ideology, and philosophy says they want to give its people the resources they need for a secure Life. But all the marches, protests, strikes, fears of job losses, and other outbursts of frustration from all over society today show we don't know how to drop old ways of living and adopt the new adaptations we need to prosper. Most of today's Conservative vs. Progressive politics is about resisting evolution to keep their old products alive and then trying to justify why others should bear the burden of humanity's refusal to stop being polar bears and start anew.

Techvolution will teach you how to move on from the past and roll your own dice to harness the technological innovation that'll put the power of wealth generating modern technology into yours, and everyone elses, hands.

Because animals sadly can't change their genes. They must endure the pain of "survival of the fittest" to evolve. We can change our fate by updating our characteristics with modern technology. But before we can do that, we need to learn how to use politics to evolve humanity and upgrade Life on Earth.

## Mixed-Ideological Politics

>I thought you guys would like to hear this story. I know my fellow wrestlers know exactly what I'm talking about. A martial art is either real or it's not. Very early on in the sport of mixed-martial arts, when the logical assumption from the marketing team is that you're going to get every taekwondo student, every karate student, every judo practitioner, and every aikido and they're just going to absolutely love mixed-martial arts.

>It ended up being the absolute opposite.

>All of those arts that I just named that, turned out to not be real, or at least real in terms of their effectiveness in actual combat, steered as far away from mixed-martial arts as they could. They begged their students not to watch. Found a number of different reasons why mixed-martial arts is too violent or too, whatever their excuse was.

>Because the practioners of old martial arts didn't like what they were finding out. They had bought into it. They had spent their Life. They had mastered some of these old martial arts movements. To only find out that it was a waste of time.

If you're happy with the political atmosphere today and enjoy being a Conservative or Progressive (or more likely being anti-Conservative or anti-Progressive), please stop reading. You'll only be looking for ammunition to fight your enemy, but anything you find will apply just as well to your side too.

We're here to rise above the hate and improve our politics.

In its highest form, politics discusses what direction a society should take. Individuals give their opinions, offer their perspectives, and exchange ideas. Should society invest in a new dock or a new road? Should we go to war with an enemy or make peace? Should we welcome newcomers or invest in citizens? Good politics is like a healthy nervous system directing resources to solve the pain society feels.

But daily politics isn't always so rational.

Cells in the human body are constantly fighting over resources, and we, the people who make up the ["body politic"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_politic) of our respective countries, are similar. Even in good times, daily politics is full of ranting, half-truths, and memes because individuals are arguing for resources like tax breaks and subsidies, cheap education and cheap labour, government bailouts and government loans.

Why would anyone want to be left out?

Political philosophy is supposed to rise above daily politics and create a shared vision for society. Only when a body politic works together can its members build a healthy nervous system where individuals and communities get the resources they need to heal the pains of the body politic enough so everyone evolves. A good philosophy makes people realize humans are not the final judge of right or wrong. As it is for all creatures, Mother Nature ultimately decides if we are harvesting resources well enough to keep our civilization playing the game of evolution.

So, while many ignorant polar bears are doomed to suffer for many more years, with a good philosophy, humans can be happy and healthy in a constantly evolving society.

To evolve, we humans develop new traits. We try to change our "genes," so to speak. We train techniques to enhance our bodies. We change government policies to direct our resources in better ways. We invent tools to solve our problems with lasting solutions. And we learn new ideas to expand our minds.

Whatever traits we develop, we do it to solve our pains. 

Martial arts is a great example.

Karate, kickboxing, taekwondo, wrestling, aikido, jiu-jitsu, judo, and boxing are our most popular martial arts. Each is a self-defence discipline that teaches techniques like wrist locks or body punches. To practice their craft each martial art creates rules that say only their techniques are allowed; there's no kicking in a boxing match, for example.

The world's martial arts co-existed for many years. Inside the disciplines, teachers happily taught their techniques to the next generation, practioners would train almost every day, and the best students would compete in tournaments, get scholarships, and strive to become world champions. Everyone would learn the rules, history, and philosophy of their discipline and keep the culture lively by congregating around experts, contests, and the latest news.

But never would these martial artists compete against each other.

However, in the late 1980s, as home televisions spread information worldwide, once-isolated fighting cultures started to open up. People got curious. As fighters began to watch other disciplines, they also asked themselves, "Which martial art is best?"

Would a boxer beat a kickboxer? What about a wrestler versus a karate guy? Many people wanted to know what if martial artists threw away their rule books and fought a real fight.

In the early 1990s, the questions stopped, and the fighting started. At first, called Vale Tudo, then Ultimate Fighting, martial artists from every discipline competed in fights that excluded no techniques. Finally, the world's fighting masters could prove their martial art was the best on Earth!

And the winner of the best martial art was...

All of them are.

And none of them.

This revelation surprised everyone. The martial arts community assumed one discipline would reign supreme. But none did because each fighting style had a limited toolbox of techniques. Sometimes those techniques were very effective in a real fight, like Brazilian jiu-jitsu's submissions or wrestling's dominant control. But many techniques like karate's katas, taekwondo's flashy high kicks, and boxing's obsession with standing toe-to-toe and swinging for a knockout were easily countered and therefore [ineffective](https://youtube.com/shorts/4IjqBuo3Bow?feature=share).

After several more years of fighting in Ultimate Fighting tournaments it became clear that some martial art disciplines were more effective than others, but each had drawbacks and none was complete. And, as Ultimate Fighting grew in popularity during the 1990s and 2000s, it forced all martial art communities to reflect on their chosen techniques, styles, and philosophy.

As said in the opening quote, many practioners, referees, coaches, and pundits (especially from the least effective disciplines) choose to retreat back into their sub-cultures because they, "didn't like what they were finding out". I.e. they were often teaching ineffective self-defense techniques and keeping their students loyal by telling stories to reinforce their disciplines culture and philosophy instead of empowering their students with evolution and efficiency.

However, many fighters embraced the effectual truth revealed by Ultimate Fighting. As a result the world of martial arts started to get all mixed up.

Kickboxers trained submissions. Wrestlers learned some punching. Masters in one discipline started as eager newbies in another. Like a bumblebee going from flower to flower, pioneering fighters like Bas Rutten, Maurice Smith, and Ken Shamrock participated in the cross-pollination of techniques and evolved skillsets far more complete than any one martial art teacher or discipline.

By opening their mind, these new martial artists discarded loyalty to a single fighting philosophy and adopted evolution's philosophy of "adapt or die." The grades, belts, trophies, medals, and scholarships of old disciplines became stepping stones to building a complete skillset and not end-goals to be relished. A fighters physical pain was the bew barometer of whether a technique was good or bad.

Finally, human self-defense learned what every lifeform on Earth knows, loyalty to man-made philsophies will not save you in Nature.

No deer in the world depends on a judge to save it when fleeing a bear, as no bear depends on a pundit declaring it the winner to get its next meal. Just like in Nature, the best martial art technique is entirely dependant on ones's opponent and surroundings while measuring the risks and rewards of the fight.

Despite being misled by teachers, pundits, and judges, martial artists weren't stupid. Their fault is quite human; they fell prey to good storytelling. 

Quality storytelling is why so many devoted boxers, judokas, and other practioners were sucked in by their respective fighting discipline. Filled with history, culture, and traditions, isolated martial arts each had a philosophy so complete, it created echo chambers that tricked people into believing they believed in the single source of truth.

During the growth of Ultimate Fighting, most fighters quickly realized the philosophies of boxing, kickboxing, wrestling, etc., let practioners honed their chosen techniques. But the rules were artificial and must be forgotten when training for real fights.

After fighters embraced all disciplines, they entered a brave new world.

A world of remarkable progress. With an open mind and access to the world's information on the internet, fighters had created a wealth of techniques and distributed the means for everybody to learn them. Thus, all willing fighters improved themselves by leaps and bounds every year. Kickboxers became wrestlers, Jiu-jitsu black belts learned high-kicks. Each martial art became a sub-discipline that brought its techniques to an open marketplace of ideas.

With evolution as their teacher, these new martial artists started to listen to their bodies instead of other peoples stories. The speed of victories, and the less pain suffered in winning them, was the best judge, teacher, and pundit of martial arts techniques. The top trainers were the ones who put their students needs above their own and helped fighters adapt better techniques faster. Whoever is first to innovate wins the race of evolution. Innovation can't be controlled by human authority because evolution has no oversight

When fighters finally embraced evolution, they created a new way for humans to think of self-defense called mixed-martial arts.

In mixed-martial arts, fighters don't limit themselves within the confines of an artificial rulebook. Every martial art has something to offer, so everyone should be a bumble bee going fom flower to flower learning from each discipline. The best technique is the one that brings results. Evolution is so admired by mixed-martial artists that everyone is supposed to give their opinions, offer their perspective, and exchange ideas, because "iron sharpens iron".

Mixing the human body's adaptability with a free mind willing to learn any technique, created a new, self-correcting, and sustainable martial art. Today, a skilled mixed-martial artist is an overwhelming favorite against a champion of any single fighting sub-discipline. Just as important, since mixed-martial arts includes all techniques, any person, whether short or tall, heavy or thin, aggressive or meek, can "mix and match" techniques to find their niche and learn to win a fight. 

And finding a niche is what evolution is all about. By empowering anyone and everyone, mixed-martial arts is the ultimate fighting philosophy.

<!-- ![Mixed-martial arts ecosystem]() -->
_Martial artists built many disciplines. Like ideologues today, they each would critize the failings of each other. But it wasn't until the new philosophy of mixed-martial arts that everyone realized we can pick and choose from any discpline to find the best techniques to win any fight._

---

On our journey to improve our politics, here's the lessons we should take from the story of mixed-martial arts.

Today, in the early 21st century, the middle-class suffers systemic problems. Taxes get more confusing. School prepares students less for the job market. Insurance gets more expensive. And there are many more topics trending badly.

Looking at hour rising bills and shrinking savings accounts, we feel beat up. And, so we look around for help.

We find lots of people selling ideological politics on television, social media, and back yard barbeques. They get our attention because ideologues insist their techniques and tools improve the economy. As the economy gets more uncertain, the more sales these ideologues close. As a result, many people think being "political" requires supporting a single ideology of "red", "blue", "green" and so on. These new ideological converts donate time and money, buy books, follow pundits, go to rallies, and...

Regular people keep getting our asses kicked in our real lives.

We think good politics means supporting _one_ ideology and wrongfully think our government, paychecks, and happiness are governed by its rulebook. But like in fighting, learning one ideology is not enough to bring prosperity. 

Today's ideological teachers, pundits, and commentarors are not philosophers pondering how best to relieve the pains of our entire body politic. They are salesman pushing their chosen techniques and tools to favour their part of society. Like old martial art teachers, ideologues may have the best solutions for you, but they also may not, and regardless, they sell their techniques before knowing what fight you're in.

<!-- ![Ant Death Spiral](/assets/problem-solving-philosophy.png) -->
_Ant Death Spiral. Image Needed._

Current ideologues are in a sort of death spiral. Whether "red", "blue", "orange" or "green", they are going in circles trying to make their techniques improve the economy. They keep failing for the same reason no single martial art discipline can be the single source of truth. Problems don't adapt to solutions. Like the polar bears are finding out, lifeforms must evolve to overcome problems. And,to evolve you must try any technique or tool and let pain tell you if its working or not.

We aren’t doing that.

As the economy continues going badly, ideological salesman contort their worldview with simple observations that justify their sales pitch. If people quit their jobs en masse, they must be lazy say Conservatives. Or if lots of people rob stores, they must be hungry say Progressives. As bosses continue to lose workers, robbers run amok, and other symptons get worse, ideologues retreat into their sub-cultures because "they don't like what they're finding out".

That's why ideologues form echo chambers.

Because inside an echo chamber they can control the narrative about economic pains and repeat how their chosen tools and techniques of tax cuts, universal health-care, highway expansion, etc. give automatic success. And when regular people feel the pain, frustrations, and anger of growing real life problems, echo chambers can easily respond by either invalidating that pain, or by assigning blame to the "the other side" because they broke the ideological rulebook.

The truth is, all political ideologies and their economic tools and techniques are incomplete; good for some problems, bad for others.

That's why I wrote _Techvolution_. It helps break any steadfast loyalty to one ideology and encourages you to realize you're a lifeform in Nature. You should only be loyal to the rules, techniques, and tools that solve your current real life problems. And you shouldn’t need to talk about what are the best solutions. You’ll know a technique worked or not by using it, and reflecting on the real-life pains of your everyday Life.

Because Nature is a street fight for the polar bear, martial artists, and you.

If we could teach evolution to polar bears, they'd have an easier time adapting to their new envionment. When fighters did embrace evolution, they improved their powers very quickly. When we embrace evolution in our politics, our body politic will have the freedom of mind to mix and match ideologies and their chosen tools and techniques to overcome any economic problem. Be it dreadfully unproductive jobs, worsening climate change, or debilitating government bureaucracy. This new philosophy called Techvolution might be called mixed-ideological politics.

Seeing through the death spiral of today's ideological echo chambers isn't easy. The constant storytelling of Twitter feeds, cable news, dinner table arguments is engrossing. To see above the salesmanship requires a solid understanding of storytelling. Once you got that, you'll avoid being sucked into the false security of ideological echo chambers.

Once you're protected from political storytelling, you’ll have the freedom of mind to use any tool and technique to find your niche. After which you'll be as powerful in your politics as a mixed-martial artist is in a fight.

<!-- ![Bills Bills Bills]() -->
_You are a member of the body politics. Your pain determines what techniqes and tools are good and bad. The lesson to learn is you can’t get resources by holding back another’s evolution because “iron sharpens iron.”_

## We Need Chambers, Just Not Echo Chambers

- Remember we're not erasing ideologies.

Before we learn to protect ourselves from political echo chambers, it's important to keep in mind, we're not erasing ideologies. We're only empowering ourselves to be like mixed-martial artists and mix and match policies, techniques, and tools to better solve our problems.

Some may be doubting our society can follow martial arts and embrace mixed-ideological politics. We can. Here's another field with a similarly enlightened mix and match philosophy.

Modern medicine has many disciplines and specialists. Some are based on cutting edge research, others on old school remedies. In the past, when isolated by geography and culture, patients were bound to do what the local healer or doctor prescribed. But today, you would never go to one medical professional, expecting them to be a master of every health problem.

There's simply too many illnesses and injuries for any medical discipline to master them all.

That's why all medical professionals today, from hemopathic healers to neural surgeons are recognized as sub-disciplines. Each has their own tools and techniques, rulebooks and philosophies. Medical professionals from each field are allowed to say their strengths and weaknesses and admit they are a niche and not the single source of truth. The skill in modern healthcare is mixing disciplines to solve a patient's pain as quickly as possible. While modern medicine certainly isn't perfect (especially its administration), it's nearly magical when compared the times when surgeons didn't santize their scalpels and doctors used one-size fits all solutions like leeches.

Most importantly we understand medical professionals can be corrupt. If a doctor over prescribes medication or a healer sells “snake oil” we understand the doctor isn’t following evidence based medicine. Like mixed-martial arts, modern medicine is about solving problems as efficiently as possible. Anything or anyone who gets in the way is automatically in the wrong.

Modern medicine and mixed-martial arts thus embrace evolution. Both medical and mixed martial arts philosophies recognize its best to select from an ecosystem of options and that solving a fighter's or patient's pain is the only sign of success. Thus no coach or teacher can control what the correct tool or technique is. Other human endeavors are also enlightened enough to embrace real-world results as superior to a person’s supposed authority. [Baseball for example did it with Moneyball fame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MjxoaynCmk).

So, if a person can train techniques from many multiple martial arts disciplines, and doctors can refer their patients to specialists from other disciplines, why can't we also be self-aware enough, and respectful enough, to mix and match different policies, tools, and techniques according to their strengths and weaknesses in solving your unique economic problems?

<!-- ![Picture of a cell]() -->
_Biology automatically heals our bodies. We only know something is wrong when we feel pain. Your economic pains are also indicators to change our ways. We need Technvolution to heal our body politic._

To enlighten our politics in such a way, we only have to accept no ideology is complete. Like in medicine or Ultimate Fighting, any technique or tool must _not_ be evaluated on its ideological purity, but based on evidence of its real-world results in reducing hunger, thirst, cold, and the other pains Life gives us so we change our ways before its too late.

Ideologues from everywhere on the political spectrum will (eventually) learn they don't need to take themselves so seriously, burden themselves so much, or sell their services so aggressively. Like a boxing coach, or speech pathologist, each can improve their chosen techniques and tools and let people come to them as needed.

But for now, the biggest obstacle to mixed-ideological politics is the same as it was for mixed-martial arts. Ideological pundits, teachers, and commentators don't realize the value of mix and match philosophy, so they tell great stories why their beliefs, techniques, and rulebooks are the single source of truth inside echo chambers. To achieve mixed-ideological politics, we must escape the spell of ideological echo chambers by understanding why great stories capture our attention so easily.

## Cinderella

- how to see through echo chambers so we can mix and match them.

The classic fairytale _Cinderella_ is a great example of how to hook an audience.

The movie tells the story of a pretty, diligent, and kind-hearted country girl named Cinderella. An unloved orphan, she lives with her wicked stepmother and two spoiled stepsisters. Jealous of her beauty, Cinderella's step family antagonize her amibitions, belittle her abilities, and force her to do all the house chores. With only the local animals for companionship, the lonely teenager dreams of a better life and a chance to find happiness.

Cinderella is ecstatic when the King announces he's hosting an extravagent ball to find a bride for his charming son. Filled with excitement, Cinderella's friends help her sew a dress for what's sure to be the most wonderful night of her life.

But, just before departing for the party, her evil family forbids her, mocks her uppitiness, and tears her dress to shreds and leave the young orphan in tears.

Thankfully, just as despair is about to set in, her Fairy Godmother appears. With a flick of her wand, the godmother transforms Cinderella’s ragged clothes into a dazzling gown and a pair of sparkling glass slippers.  The godmother also creates a carriage and a team of horses so her mistreated goddaughter will go to the ball in style.

At the party, Cinderella captivates everyone with her beauty and grace, especially the Prince. The two glide across the floor and whisper sweet nothings in each other’s ears. Sadly though, the spell that gave Cinderella her dress and entourage ends, making the shy orphan flee the ballroom. The Prince is left with only a glass slipper to remember her by.

The heartbroken king to be is determined to find his true love and orders his men to search the entire kingdom for the girl who fits the glass slipper.

They eventually get to Cinderella’s house. The wicked stepmother has gotten wise that her stepdaughter is the Prince’s heartthrob, and so locks the unfortunate orphan in the attic. To the rescue come Cinderella's friends who steal the key and open the attic door. Cinderella can now ask the Prince’s men if she can try on the glass slipper. But, just as she’s about to, the evil stepmother smashes the precious mememto.

To which Cinderella responds by revealing she has the other slipper.

And the rest is history.

The movie _Cinderella_ was very popular when it was released. It's popular today. And it'll be popular hundreds of years from now when humanity is (hopefully) travelling the stars. People will always like the story because everyone can cheer for a warm hearted person overcoming bullies to improve her life

People love stories. We can't get enough of them. A good story lets us experience the drama, trials, and experiences of another person. From horrible brushes with death, to whimsical romances, stories teach us the lessons of many lives.

Stories pass-on so much information because they create a complete reality. The creation process starts with the props that fill the storyworld like cups, clothes, and homes. Next, there is music to relay the emotions of characters in the story. Next comes the dialogue of the story which communicates what each character wants in an easy to understand way. 

Next, it is the villain who likes the world the way it is and defends it against change. Thereafter comes the philosophy of the story-world that dictates the rules everyone in the story is presumed to live by; for example Cinderella is supposed to obey her stepmother. Cinderella is a hero of the story because she disregards the ruling philosphy because she envisions a better world for herself. And at the top of this story pyramid are tools; a catchall term for the real objects, from glass slippers to Death Stars, that are above being regular props because they are the levers of power that control what happens in the story-world.

Storytellers work hard to mix these incredients together. When done properly, the resulting "cake" will transfix audiences and arise strong emotions and lasting commitments because we’ve experienced the Life of another person inside an easy to digest package.

---

And that brings us back to avoiding today's political echo chambers so we can practice mixed-ideological politics and use any and all techniques and tools that solve our real-life problems.

Dismantling echo chambers starts by realizing _Cinderella_ isn't about a girl abused by her evil step-family. The fairytale is also not about a girl overcoming her evil step-family to marry her prince charming.

The story of _Cinderella_ is about a girl overcoming her antagonistic step-family using levers of powers, i.e. tools.

If Cinderella doesn't get the horses, carriage, and evening dress from her Fairy Godmother, she'll never get into the ball. If the Prince didn't find her lost slipper, she'd never see him again. If the imprisoned girl's allies didn't steal the key to the attic, she'd never get out in time. And if Cinderella didn't have the second glass slipper, her name would be famous as a tragedy instead of a fairytale.

Cinderella had a problem. It wasn't that her step-family were terrible people, that the rules of society were unjust, or her tragic history. Cinderella's problem was that her terrible step-family controlled the tools Cinderella needed to improve her life.

By the same token that "we are what we eat", our politics is the tools we use to earn money. That's why tools are the levers of power in every story.

From _Star Wars_, to _The Matrix_, to _Cinderella_ stories start with a group of people controlling the tools while creating a ruling philosophy to justify their control. The hero suffers an injustice that lets them see a problem with the ruling philosophy. When the hero reaches for a tool to solve their problem, antagonists reveal themselves by defending their power base by preventing access to the important tools. The drama of the story is heroes and villains battling to control the tools needed to change the world. The winner changes, or reaffirms, the world in their image.

Notice the dynamic of the ruling philosophy has a public and true face. When the stepmother rips Cinderella's gown, locks her in the attic, and destroys the slipper, she's using tools to alter the world in a consistent way, letting us see the philosophy of oppression in her heart.

Yet, the stepmother would not admit her abuse. She'd tell outsiders, and likely even herself, that Cinderella is loved and well cared for. If asked why her stepdaughter is working so hard or absent from the ball, the stepmpther would create a justification by saying something like Cinderella is acting up and needs to be taught a lesson, or has no interest going to the party.

The stepmother has a public face, to hide her true intentions to control the levers of power. The truth is the stepmother favoured her daughters and thus didn't want Cinderella to compete with them. When Cinderella went along with her stepmother's wishing, she was wearing a mask of oppression.

![Masked and antagonsit](/assets/problem-solving-philosophy.png)
_Masks of oppression often becomes the face we wear._

If a doctor insists on an ineffective treatment, or martial arts coach advises to use a bad technique, they are corrupt. The stepmother was corrupt. Political authority is invalid when it doesn't empower follower's evolution. Cinderella's freedom only came true when she grabbed the tools she needed to change the world to her benefit.

Another important thing to learn from stories is that once they end, the hero and villian are no longer main characters. We don't need to hear from Cinderella after she marries the Prince because "they lived happily ever after". As for the stepmother, she has no more tools to attack Cinderella with, and is thus no longer a threat worthy of attention.

Tools being levers of power, how we use our tools being our true philosophy, and main characters having a limited shelf-life, are the facts those who sell themselves, their ideology, and their tools as being the eternal single source of truth that will solve all your problems, don't like.

## Mixed Ideological Politics Come By Ending Stories

- echo chambers end when we change tools, so we automatically mix and match them when we change tools.

When someone is telling you a story on cable news or Twitter, and the hero and villian argue back and forth endlessly about who is "wrong", you're watching public facing philosophies use each other to give a performance. These are echo chambers looking to close a sale. Ideologues only talk about things like justice, history, culture to appeal to their audience's personal tastes. In reality they only want sell their chosen tools and techniques.

The giveaway to spot these fake stories is they don't have a conclusion.

Echo chambers don't like conclusions because they force reflection on whether the hero, his philosophy, and his chosen tools changed the world or not. For example, if a boxer gets his arm broken by a submission in a fight, he must reflect on his tactics the same way Cinderella did after her dress was torn to shreds. However, today's ideologues are not Cinderella, mixed-martial artists, or doctors searching for the best possible tools and techniques needed to win your fight. Rather, ideologues are old martial arts teachers saying they are impartial and fair, while in reality selling their Industrial Age tools and techniques to people living in the Internet Age.

Remember, it was only when curious fighters said, "what discipline is best?" and engaged in real fights and listened to fighter’s pains, that martial artists realized no discipline can be the single-source of truth.

Sadly, our politics today doesn’t  have the freedom of modern martial artists or medical professionals to embrace being a sub-disciplines with recognized strengths and weaknesses. We can't accept all our lives are unique and so we must roll your own dice to find what works for us. One ideology says you should never vote to raise taxes, the other can't says never cut them. One side fights unionzation as evil, while the other defends it as perfect. One side wants you're support to expand government oversight and social programs, another wants to dismantle them both. Tools and techniques are always black or white for today's ideologues because they must pretend to be the single source of truth.

Tools are of course neither perfect or evil. They are inanimate. Like the glass slippers, they only hold value if they can help solve a problem.

To escape echo chambers, and embrace mixed-ideological politics, you must understand when a mixed-martial arts enters a boxing gym, he's not being disloyal to his wrestling coach. When a family doctor refers you to a physiotherapist, she's not being disloyal to medical doctors. When a biologist says "I don't know, ask a neuroscientist" she's not being a bad biologist. This is because these fields understand they are sub-disciplines that exists to help a person solve a problem.

Fighters overcome opponents. Patients battle diseases. Cinderella had an evil stepfamily.

What's your problem?

Is your job not paying enough. Are rude customers wasting your time. Is a bad supply chain increasing your costs....

Now, what tools do you need to solve your problems?

If you're willing to consider any tool, from a handgun to a solar panel, to solve your problem, you're on the way to mixed-ideological politics. If you think any tool is "off limits", you've been sold a single ideology and are at least partially stuck inside an echo chamber.

You should want the freedom to choose any tool. Not only because it's proven so succesful in modern medicine, science, and mixed-martial arts, but because selecting any adaptation lets you harness evolution. And evolution has no limits, respects no man-made rules, and is the reason why we all exist.

## There is No Lion King

- changing techniques/tools is evolution. changing tools is technological evolution.

We weren't the first species to live on Earth and probably won't be the last. Life has survived billions of years without depending on any species. There's nothing special about any creature. We each survive and thrive according to the same laws of evolution.

Life needs evolution because the Universe is a hostile place. It's constantly changing as mountains fall apart, volcanoes erupt, stars emit radiation, heat is lost, waves wash away shorelines, and endless more things transform our planet. To respond to a changing environment, Life must keeping evolving a stream of new species.

Those who survive do so because their combination of attributes gives them an edge. But, as the planet inevitably changes, traits lose their advantage. Thus, while evolution is a constant race to harvest resources more efficiently, no species ever knows if their list of adaptions is good enough to overcome the problems of a changing environment. That's why pain hurts so much; it's Life's way of telling individuals to change their behavior and try something else before it's too late.

Evolution has these laws:

 - No species survives forever.
 - All lifeforms have a common ancestry.
 - Evolution of new species is gradual.
 - The number of species always multiplies to fill niches.
 - Natural selection determines which species lives on.

These laws oversee every evolutionary race. The first sprint started after a few amino acids combined to form the first cells 3.6 billion years ago. Since then, evolution has continually created new species. Each is based on the one prior, but each removes or adds traits in a hope of finding an edge. That edge could mean getting bigger or smaller, faster or slower to out compete another creature. Or, the edge could be further specialization to find a niche no one else has; such as polar bears being the only seal hunters seals in a frozen ecosystem.

Regardless of what new trait an organism evolves, evolution's selection of the best adaptions requires a daily and hour scrutinizing, throughout the world, of every adaption, even the slightest. The best way to continually test species is with ecosystems. By putting creatures inside a shared environment, there are checks and balances to keep everyone on task. So when any plant, fungus, scavenger, predator, herbivore, or omnivore falls behind, Life can easily reach in the ecosystem and create a new individual or species to take the laggard's place and keep the circle of Life rolling.

![Elephant Speciation](/assets/speciation-elephants.png)
_Here's one example of how a species evolves. Mayr pg 176._

The story of Life is billions of years old with trillion of lifeforms coming and going. Happily, the pages are very organized. Since Life works so hard to adapt to its surroundings, we can track evolution using Earth's geological changes (Mayr 58). Each period, epoch, and age of Earth's geography, from the Jurassic to the Paleozoic, have different characteristics like concentration of oxygen in the air, amount of water in the oceans, or ice in the poles. These geological changes required many new species and thus serve as chapters in the story of Life.

While Life's evolution was relatively seamless between each chapter, species often had an agonizing time during the transition. Each time Earth's geology transitioned it was like a climactic conclusion asking if an individual's list of adaptations would prosper in the new environment. The few who passed the test climbed the ladder to the next age, while most species went around in circles, stubbornly fighting their inevitable extinction; their existence only remembered as fossils to be may be uncovered one day. 99% of all the species that have lived, are dead.

![Evolutionary Spiral](/assets/speciation-elephants.png)
_The Evolutionary Spiral in the [history of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_evolutionary_history_of_life). From the perspective of Life, it's seamless, but for lifeforms, there are often tragic endings._

It took scientists centuries to demystify the story of Life's evolution, and this summary misses the many details. But the essence is here: Life must adapt new species to Earth's ever-changing environment. The faster the better; the more species the better. No interference is allowed. Wherever there's liquid water, an artist named evolution works night and day creating custom lifeforms to harvest every possible ray of sunshine, scap of food, and source of heat. Evolutions's constant stream of creations is the only reason Earth isn't just another rock revolving around a star with no one to notice how beautiful the Universe is.

And now, we understand why echo chambers are doomed. They presume an adaptation can be ever-lasting. They commit themselves to a few techniques and tools and antagonize the creation of new ones by telling stories of their adaptation's supposed perfection. Life, of course, doesn't care what we tell ourselves. Leaving those inside echo chambers to reconcile the ideology they passionately believe in against the pain they feel in the real world as they walk around in circles, finding someone to blame because they're aging adaptations can't harvest enough resources to make their users happy and healthy.

As it's always been, evolution is our way out. Unfettered innovation explains why modern medicine, mixed-martial arts, and fairytale characters like Cinderella are so successful. They let themselves become many species by adapting to their situation. They examine their problem and select whatever technique or tool will help them solve it. Because of this freedom of mind, they can harness the power of evolution by reflecting on their progress and make changes before it's too late.

For us to master evolution using our politics there is one important difference to always keep in mind. Humans do not evolve. Technology does.

<!--  -->
_The anger in politics today is the people living through their adaptations and way of life. We don't have the philotopshy to tell us to drop the old and pickup the new. Our anger in the face of AI shows we are all the polar bear._

## Human Biology is Out, Technology is In

- We live on the same evolutionary tree as biology, but we only operate technology.

THIS SHOULD BE MUCH SHORTER. JUST WRAP IT UP.

The Boston Symphony had a problem. There was a lot of men in their ranks. There were plenty of talented female musicians auditioning for new parts and challenging for better seats in the orcachstra, yet not many were making the cut.

After auditioning musicians removed their shoes, it took only a few years for women to start getting their fair due.

Evolution is a tailor. It's mission is finding the best adaptation for the problems of a given environment. And no one knows what environment the future will bring. So we must respond to failure with another adaption as quickly as possible. Anything else that gets in the way, like gender, is all noise.

Finding the perfect biological adaptation takes a long time. Since organic lifeforms are physically attached to their adaptations, the genetic mutations needed to create new characteristics takes in millions of years. But while biological evolution is slow, it's also inevitable. Genetic mutations happen involuntarily during procreation, so biological innovation is automatic with no interference possible.

There are no stepmothers in the biological evolution of Life.

We humans can't evolve biologically. If we did, then their might be a difference between male and female musicians. But, it's not our genes that change when learning a adaptation like a violin or piano. Instead, we adapt our psychology to incorprate a new tool into our list of traits.

Anyone with enough patience can learn any tool and evolve their skillset.

We are still biological lifeforms, but because we invent new tools, we facilitate Life's evolution with technology instead of biology. There is effectively no difference. Life wants adaptations that consistently collect energy, adapt, and procreate. Life doesn't care about the material composition anymore than a composer or audience cares what gender the orchastra is.

Our technological evolution follows the same laws as regular evolution.

 - No technology survives forever.
 - All technology has a common ancestry.
 - Evolution of new tools is gradual.
 - The number of tools always multiplies to fill niches.
 - Natural selection determines which tools lives on.

Thus, we humans are biological vessels for technological evolution. As Cinderella demonstrated our fate is determined by the tools in our hands, not the genes in our cells.

Our evolution requires innovators undertake the burden of inventing new technology, that becomes tools, that effectively becomes a new species once someone uses it. To connect people to adapatations requires a reason, which is best communicated with a story. Therefore, innovation requires storytelling inside marketing or ideology to connect person and tool.

This is what happened during the creation of judo, boxing, wrestling and the other martial arts. While these disciplines of course don't have much technology, they still use bags, pads, ropes, gloves, weights, books, and eventually video, to train, learn, and pass-on knowledge.

Thus, these martial arts used the human body as a foundation to attach a mixture of techniques and tools, that gave the human body and mind into a variety of distinct traits, and therefore created different species like boxers, judokas, kickboxers, etc.

![Technological Tree of Life](/assets/speciation-elephants.png)
_We live on the technological tree of Life._

Once home televisions and the internet allowed lots of information to flow, it became possible to do what evolution does; review the species inside an ecosystem, evaluate their strengths and weaknesses, and pick and choose the best based on the requirements of a given fight using an enlightened philosophy called mixed-martial arts.

But, while natural selection in biological Life is automatic, it is not for technological Life. For fighters to mix and match the best martial arts techniques required seeing through the stories that connected them to each self-defense discipline. And seeing through stories isn't our best feature.

Why?

Because by seeing through a story that connects us to a tool, we're doing what Cinderella did and evaluating our place in the power structure we live in. You may be part of a race, culture, ethnicity, or religion. These may help you, or be harming you.

But they do not define your political power. The power structure you live in, is the control and access to the tools your company, bureaucracy, family, and country uses to harvest resources. Every farm, office, warehouses, factory, has positions that determine how much control you, and everyone, has to use the levers of power.

Cinderella challenged for a better seat in the orchastra, but the competition wasn't open nor fair. Instead she met a host of reasons why evolution shouldn't happen.

_"Cinderella, the ball isn't for you."_
_"Cinderella, clean up, that is your job, because you're the stepdaughter."_
_"Cinderella, you can't try on the glass slipper, because I'm the mother, and I say only my daughters can be a princess."_
_"Cinderella, your pain is invalid, do what you're told to do."_

We can't understand a word of mushroom, dolphine, or any other creatures communication, yet we understand their evolution because we only listen to their actions in their quest to harvest resources and procreate. Because we can understand human language, the natural selection of tools is a confusing mess of real stories about magical new tools and fake reasons of why we shouldn't reach for them told by antagoinsts like the stepmother who don't want to admit evolution has toppled the power structure that gave them their edge.

Today, our society's huge and expanding ideological echo chambers exist to fight evolution.

And they won't stop getting bigger or nastier because, like it did with biological lifeforms so many times before, evolution has finished a chapter in the story of Life. Today Life is trying to leave one age and and enter a new one. The old age wants to stay alive past its shelf-life and is using Conservative and Progressive echo-chambers to keep it's old tools and way of Life alive.

All people today thus have a huge choice to make; follow fake stories while going round in circles struggling to find resources using outdated adaptations. Or climb the ladder and evolve, as quickly as possible, so Life can prosper in the fledgling Internet Age.

## Old Age, Ladder Climb, Final Frontier

In 55 BC, the Roman general Julius Caesar had a problem. He was in control of prosperous territory west of the Rhine river while the east side was ruled by hostile German barbarians. Caesar defeated the Germans in open battle, but that is why the Germans avoid fighting him and instead used small boats to raid his villages in the night.

So, to protect his society, Caesar had to defeat an enemy that wouldn't fight him.

He came up with an idea. The Germans were a tribal people, with no written language, limited metal working, and primitive engineering. Meanwhile, the Romans built quality roads, long aquaducts, huge colliseums, and seemingly whatever else they wanted.

To showcase their technological power, Caesar decided to build a bridge.

The construction was carried out in an area where the depth of the river would be up to nine meters. The bridge was built on double wooden piles that were driven into the riverbed by winching up a large stone and releasing it, thereby driving the posts into the riverbed. The construction system ensured that the greater the flow of water, the harder the bridge was held together. Caesar’s soldiers built the bridge in just 10 days.

Watching the Roman legions crossing the Rhine river mystified the Germans. They struggled getting flimsy boats across the wide river now they saw thousands of soldiers us piles, hammers, saws, and engineering plans to build a "thing" that let people walk over the mighty Rhine river. It would be like us seeing 10,000 people teleport to the Moon and back and someone expecting us to go head and use it willy nilly. Our psychology needs to understand a technology [before we can make use of it.](https://youtu.be/hJWJ1zZ9vu0?feature=shared)

Caesar defeated the Germans by educating them about technological evolution. He showcased how Romans were masters of the Classic Age, and the Germans were hundreds of years behind in the Iron Age. So impressed by Rome's levers of almost magical powers, the Germans made peace that lasted for generations.

We already know biological evolution is tracked in eras like the famous Jurassic period. For humans the chapters of evolution are the ages of new technology. The tools we create, use, and understand determines where we are in the story of Life. Here is a list of all the technological ages, and the civilizations that led humanity to each.

  - Bronze Age: 	  2000 - 1250 (Babylon)
  - Iron Age:  		  1250 - 550  (Greece)
  - Classic Age:  	550 - 476   (Rome)
  - Middle Ages: 	  500 - 1439  (Abbasid)
  - Renaissance: 	  1440 - 1686 (Italy)
  - Science Age: 	  1687 - 1759 (France)
  - Industrial Age: 1760 - 1969 (America)
  - Internet Age: 	1970 -      (tbd)

Like Julius Caesar demonstrated, the difference between technological ages is huge. A fundamental new technology is an entirely new stage of evolution, with a totally different list of traits in the hands of its people. There is no biological difference between peoples in different ages, but their levers of power certainly are different. Going from one chapter to another, like from Bronze to Iron, requires re-inventing everything: transportion, agriculture, war, healthcare, music, self-defense, medicine, and everything else that makes up a civilization.

As we already discusssed, biological evolution is slow but involuntary, and thus the biological game of chutes and ladders never stops. 

Technological life isn't so certain. 

The Germans didn't enter into the Classic Age for hundreds of more years after seeing Caesar's bridge. The Romans themselves stalled their advancement and were invaded and colonized by those very same Germans. Advancing a civilization requires leaving the old one behind, which for many nations is so hard, it never happens.

A big reason for this is the loyalty stories foster in humanity. Stories are meant to pass-on knowledge to aid everyone's continuous evolution, but they often become ways to keep humanity from evolving, as stories used to pass-on the hard-won lessons transform into stories to antagonize anyone playing the game of evolution.

America won the Industrial Age. It did so with a mixture of hardwork, ingenuity, and injustice. And, in 1970, America invented the personal computer and the internet. This is the technology of the future, but we are not yet in the Internet Age, for the same reasons seeing the bridge didn't upgrade the Germans all those years ago.

Evolving our society to the possibilities of modern technology requires a new game of technological evolution. Instead of playing, our society is resting on our laurels and stagnating while trying to find someone to blame for the social, economic, and political problems that inevitable get worse when any creature stops playing the game of evolution and walks in circles in a death spiral.

<Flipper1970 />

_Not evolving to the Internet Age means we keep hitting chutes._

## Why Freedom Keeps Winning

- what else can a business owner do when his technology is bested but increase his marketing?

Once you realize humans must evolve like any other creature, but that we can't evolve biologically, this new philosophy falls into place: technological evolution is the plot of human existence. But the stories that connect us to good tools also keep us loyal to old ones. Therefore we're often masked from the fact constant technological evolution is our pathway to success. 

This is the first political philosophy written after evolution is a well researched fact. It validates everyone's frontline pain. The person paying a bill, driving a car, using a medication is the pain receptor of the body politic. Their pain determines what tool, technique, or policy best solves a problem, not their boss, teacher, or pundit who has the incentive to delay evolution for their personal gain. All other lifeforms in Nature have the ability to mix and match their tools and techniques to find their niche. They can each freely evolve and so must we to update our body politic to the Internet Age.

We have biology that says survive at all cost, but we prosper via with technology that lives according to its own Life cycle. There is thus many stepmothers and polar bears in our body politic. So, you don't need to speak English to understand the yellings fest of today's ideological politics.

Today's ideologies are born in Industrial Age. Their way of life is based around industrial technology like broadcast radio and television, school libraries and lecture halls, transportation by car or truck, suburban housing, and so on down the mass-marketing list. All these one-size fits all adaptations are past their shelf-life and are no longer levers of power empowering users to climb ladders in the game of evolution.

So we don't climber the ladder to the next chapter in the story of Life.

Instead, we continue industrailzing society, with too many large roads, cars, homes, planes, televisions, one-time-use products, and other mass-produced industrial goods. These one-size fits all solutions cannot give a return on their investment because they're dinosaurs trying to live in the Ice Age, or a fighting discipline pretending its the single source of truth. Instead of being genuine levers of power in your quest to collect resources and procreate, our aging Industrial Age tools rely on huge marketing and extreme ideological storytelling to keep their users engaged.

Mixed martial-arts was so successful because it let anyone, big or small, genius or simple, learn and use whatever technique helped _them_, win their fight. Evolution empowers the users, students, people on the frontine, not the trainers, teachers, or bosses.

Because we don't yet have a new philosophy reminding everyone we "innovate or die" like any other lifeform, regular people are left being Cinderella locked in the attic, wanting a better Life without the know-how to get it. Without the power of evolution in their minds, they tell stories within either Conservative or Progressive ideology, to justify why they should get priority access from the dwindling carcus of the Industrial Age.

- Hi, I'm a Progressive Activist. My creativity imagined the Industrial Age policies and tools that spread unimaginable wealth to mankind. After the Industrial Age ended, I kept pushing those same tools and policies and now they're bizarre. That's why my art films, marketing campaigns, and protests are a bad return on investment. I used easy credit and cheap labour to sustain my old adaptations, but now they're both running out. To hide my ineffectivness, I've been using a public philosophy that because my, or someone elses, parents and grandparents were abused and disadvantaged my old tools and policies are still needed. By the way, Fascist Conservatives are greedy and evil they deserve nothing!

- Hi, I'm a Conservative Businessman. My industriousness built the Industria Age's companies, tools, and wealth for mankind. After the Industrial Age ended, I kept selling the same tools and companies using spectacle. American homes, vehicles, televisions are now huge! They do the same functions though, so we had to use easy credit and cheap labour to pay for it all and now its running out. To hide my ineffectivness, I've been using a public philosophy that because my parents or grandparents were smart and hard working their old tools and policies that I still use today are still needed. By the way, Socialist Progressives are lazy and evil they deserve nothing!
- I don't like politics. But as cost of living goes up my happiness goes down, I'm looking for answers. I really think `insert name here` are terrible people, so my only other choice is `insert name here`. What I'm really worried about is the technology that underpins my job becoming obsolete because I love Netflix but want to keep working at Blockbuster.
- None of us knows how to start a web server.

We've delayed evolution to the Internet Age for so long that we're like polar bears in the Amazon. We're Industrial Age species trying to live in the Internet Age. As a result debt, inflation, insurance and the cost of living is increasing and we can't bring rates<button @click="rdegg = !rdegg">*</button>down proactively and ease ourselves into the next chapter in the story of Life.

Life has let 99.9% of all prior species die because they failed to harvest enough resources to procreate. Industrial Age ideologues, cultures, and societies are writing themselves on that list.

Without a new philosophy to instruct people how to play the game of evolution, people have no choice but to fight for their tool's and therefore their ideology's survival; it's all they know. 

Mixing the human body's adaptability to learn many techniques with a free mind willing to learn, will create a new, self-correcting, and sustainable political philosophy. Since mixed-ideological politics frees any person, whether short or tall, heavy or thin, aggressive or meek, can "mix and match" techniques and tools to find their niche and learn to live their Life more efficiently, be it sealing your windows, to inventing a new app. Sleeping better, or leaning a new language.

So, you must be Cinderella, a mixed-martial artist trained to pickup whatever tools helps improve your future. You're a bumblebee rolling your own dice as you go from opportunity to opportunity in the search for the resources you need to find your niche and win the game of evolution. You'll need the help of creative Progressives and hard-working Conservatives to do it. This mixed-ideological politics is brought to you inside a nice new political philosophy called Techvolution.

Keep reading, and you'll climb the ladder to Internet Age. Jeff Goldblum says it's inevitable, why would anyone not follow him?

>If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that Life will not be contained. Life breaks free. It expands to new territories. It crashes through barriers. Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is....Life...finds a way.
