## Doom and Gloom

The paranoid are right. Aliens are real. The government is a lie. 

- You can either pick a side, or take a try...

## Mixed Ideological Politics

>I thought you guys would like to hear this story. I know my fellow wrestlers know exactly what I'm talking about. A martial art is either real or it's not. Very early on in the sport of mixed-martial arts, when the logical assumption from the marketing team is that you're going to get every taekwondo student, every karate student, every judo practitioner, and every aikido and they're just going to absolutely love mixed-martial arts.

>It ended up being the absolute opposite.

>All of those arts that I just named that, turned out to not be real, or at least real in terms of their effectiveness in actual combat, steered as far away from mixed-martial arts as they could. They begged their students not to watch. Found a number of different reasons why mixed-martial arts is too violent or too, whatever their excuse was.

>Because the practioners of old martial arts didn't like what they were finding out. They had bought into it. They had spent their life. They had mastered some of these old martial arts movements. To only find out that it was a waste of time.

Are you sick of today's politics? The ranting and raving. The endless half-truths and memes that only serve to entrench already held beliefs. This books feels your pain. It's geared to the moderate middle who want politics to be about rational problem-solving instead of extremist mudslinging.

Solving your pain is what this book is all about.

To fight pain we humans develop things. We change government policies to direct our resources in better ways. We invent tools to solve our problems with lasting solutions. And, we learn new ideas to expand our minds.

Whatever we develop, we do it to solve our pain.

Martial arts is a great example of this quest. Karate, kickboxing, taekwondo, wrestling, aikido, jiu-jitsu, judo, and boxing are our most popular self-defense disciplines. To subdue an opponent each of them teach a set of techniques. During training and matches each discpline creates rules that say only their techniques are allowed; there's no kicking in a boxing match for example.

The world's martial arts co-existed for many years. Inside the disciplines, teachers happily taught their techniques to the next generation. Practioners would train almost everyday. The best students would compete in tournaments, get scholarships, and strive to become world champions. And, believers of a martial art would congregate around experts, tournaments, and the latest news.

But never would these martial arts fight across disciplines.

However, in the late 1980s, as home televisions spread information across the world, once isolated fighting cultures started to open up. People got curious. Fighters started to ask themselves, "which martial art is best?"

Would a boxer beat a kickboxer? What would happen if a wrestler fought a karate guy? Many people wanted to know what if martial artists threw away the rule books and fought a real fight.

In the early 1990s, the questions stopped, and the fighting started. At first called Vale Tudo, then Ultimate Fighting, martial artists from every discipline fought in fights with no rules. Finally, the world's fighting masters could prove their martial art was the best on Earth!

And the winner of the best martial art was...

All of them are.

And none of them. 

This revelation surprised everyone. The martial arts community assumed one discipline would reign supreme. But that wasn't the case because each discipline had a limited toolbox of techniques. Sometimes those techniques were very effective in a real fight; like Brazilian jit jitsu's submissions, or wrestling's dominate control. But many techniques like karate's katas, taekwondo's flashy high-kicks, boxing's obesssion with standing toe-to-toe and swinging for a knockout were easily countered and therefore not effective.

After several more years of fighting in "no rules" martial arts tournaments it became clear that some martial art disciplines were more effective than others, but each had drawbacks and none was complete. As Ultimate Fighting kept on growing in popularity during the 1990s and 2000s, it forced all martial art communities to reflect on their techniques and beliefs.

As said in the opening quote, many practioners, referees, coaches, and pundits (especially from the least effective disciplines) choose to retreat back into their sub-cultures because they, "didn't like what they were finding out."

However, many fighters embraced the effectual truth revealed by Ultimate Fighting. As a result the world of martial arts started to get all mixed up.

Some kickboxers started to train submissions. Wrestlers learned some punching. Masters in one discipline started as eager newbies in another. Eventually, after several years of watching, learning, and participating in the cross-pollination of techniques, these fighters evolved skills far beyond their old martial arts teachers and disciplines.

By opening their mind, martial artists discarded the mythical codes of old martial arts and adopted evolution's philosophy of "adapt or die." A fighters physical pain became a barometer of their chosen techniques success or failure. Thereafter, human self-defense finally learned what every lifeform on Earth knows; there is no rulebook.

No deer in the world depends on a judge to save it when fighting off a bear, as no bear depends on a pundit declaring it the winner to get its next meal.

Just like in Nature, the best martial art technique is entirely dependant on ones's opponent and surroundings while measuring the risks and rewards of the fight. Whatever techniques are most efficient to win the fight are the best.

Before Ultimate Fighting, all fighters were puting the horse before the cart, so to speak. They had the answers before knowing the problem because as students they were tricked into thinking fights are won or lost according to man-made rules governeed by teachers, pundits, and judges. 

Despite sometimes getting beaten black and blue in street fights, martial artists were never stupid. Their fault is quite human; they fell prey to good storytelling. 

Quality storytelling is why so many devoted boxers, judokas, and other practioners were so easily misled by their respective discipline. Filled with history, culture, and traditions isolated martial art disciplines acted like echo chambers with a reality so complete, it tricked people into believing it was the single source of truth.

Once martial artists opened their minds, they started fighting for themselves. Fighters quickly realized the rules of boxing, kickboxing, wrestling, etc., were excellent for honing their chosen techniques but were also artificial and must be forgotten when preparing for an actual fight.

When fighters customized their techniques to the problems faced in a fight, evolution became their instructor and the community entered a brave new world. 

A world of remarkable progress. With an open mind and access to the world's information on the internet, fighters improved themselves by leaps and bounds every year. Kickboxers became wrestlers, Jiu-jitsu black belts learned high-kicks. The individual disciplines brought their techniques to an open marketplace of ideas.

With evolution as their teacher, these new martial artists started to listen to their bodies instead of other peoples stories. The speed of victories, and the less pain suffered in winning them, was the best judge, teacher, and pundit of what's the best fighting philosophy. The top martial arts trainers were the ones who helped their students adapt faster.

This new evolutionary fighting philosophy was so successful it created a new way for humans to think of self-defense called mixed-martial arts.

In mixed-martial arts, fighters don't limit themselves within the confines of an artificial rulebook. Everyone should learn a little from every discipline. The best technique is the one that brings results. So devoted to evolution, mixed-martial artists want everyone to improve because, "iron sharpens iron".

Mixing the human body's adaptability to learn many techniques, with a free mind willing to learn, created a new, self-correcting, and sustainable martial art. Today, even a moderately skilled mixed-martial artist is an overwhelming favorite against a champion of any single fighting discipline. Just as important, since mixed-martial arts includes all techniques, any person, whether short or tall, heavy or thin, aggressive or meek, can find their niche and learn to win a fight. 

And finding a niche is what evolution is all about. By empowering anyone and everyone, mixed-martial arts is the ultimate fighting philosophy.

On our journey to improve our politics, here's the lessons we should take from the story of mixed-martial arts.

Today, in the early 21st century, the middle-class has many systemic problems. Taxes get more confusing. School prepares students less for the job market. Insurance gets more expensive. And there are many more topics trending badly.

We all want better for ourselves and our kids. People sellling their politics say they can improve the economy, and so the worst things get, the more sales these ideologues close. As a result, many people today think being "political" means supporting a single ideology of "red", "blue", "green" and so on. With the enthusiasm of a shiny new product in hand, these newly political people back one ideology by donating time and money, buying books, following pundits, going to rallies, and...

We keep getting our asses kicked in our real lives.

Like old martial artists who believed their chosen discipline was the single source of truth, the middle-class keeps losing because we believe in _one_ ideology and wrongfully think our jobs, paychecks, and happiness are governed by its rulebook.

As our economy keeps getting worse, the more people buy one ideology's storytelling. After the sale, they join those stuck in a self-reinforcing spiral. Army ants have something similar when a group gets cut off from the main foraging party. In isolation each ant follows the scent trail of the other ant. Without a rescue from another ant, those inside go around in a circle until they all die of exhaustion.

Today's political ideologies are in a similar death spiral. Inside echo chambers, teachers, pundits, commentators sell their books, lectures, podcasts to people looking for answers. This spiral is hard to break out of because each ideology is persuasive that its techniques give automatic success. And when we continue to feel the pain of real life problems, we're told the other ideologies are not options because they break the ideological rulebook. Or even worse, we're told we must attack other ideologies because the failing economy is _their_ fault.

The truth is, all political ideologies and their economic plans are incomplete.

That's why I wrote _Techvolution_. It helps break any steadfast loyalty you have one ideology and encourages you to realize you're a lifeform in Nature, and thus the only rules and techniques that matter are those that help you solve your specific and unique real life problems.

Nature is a street fight, and evolution is the only teacher you need.

With this freedom of mind to mix and match ideologies you'll overcome any political or economic problem. Be it a dreadful morning commute, rising climate change, or debilitating government bureaucracy. This new philosophy might be called mixed-ideological politics.

Seeing through the death spiral of today's ideological echo chambers isn't easy. The constant storytelling of Twitter feeds, cable news, dinner table arguments is persuasive and hard to get away from. Buying an ideology incomplete answers can even be comforting when the future looks so uncertain. To see above today's political noise and salesmanship requires a solid understanding of storytelling. One you got that, you'll avoid being sucked into the false security of ideological echo chambers.

Once you're protected from ideological stortelling, you can adopt mixed-ideological politics. After reading this book, you'll be as powerful in your politics as a mixed-martial artist is in a fight.

* Note: if you're so curious, we analyze storytelling more indepth in _Story-Cut Tools_.

## Echo Chambers Are Needed, Until They're Not

- Remember we're not erasing ideologies.

Before we learn to protect ourselves from the echo chambers, it's important to always keep in mind, we're not erasing ideologies. We're only empowering ourselves to be like mixed-martial artists and mix and match ideologies to solve our problems.

Some may be doubting our society can follow martial arts and embrace mixed-ideological politics. I know we can, because we do it in so many areas. Here's another a field which has adopt a similarly enlightened philosophy.

Modern medicine has many disciplines and specialists. Some are based on cutting edge research, others on old school remedies. In the past, when isolated by geography and culture, people would be bound to do what the local healer or doctor prescribed. But today, you would never go to one medical professional, expecting them to be a master of every possible health problem.

There's simply too many human health problems for any one medical discipline to master.

That's why all medical professionals today, from hemopathic healers to neural surgeons, are recognized as sub-disciplines with their own techniques, cultures, and rulebooks. Every medical professional is allowed to say its strengths and weaknesses and admit its a niche and not the single source of truth. The skill in practicing modern medicine is mixing disciplines to solve a patients pain as quickly as possible. While modern medicine certainly isn't perfect (especially its administration), it's nearly magical when compared the times when surgeons didn't santize their tools and doctors used one-size fits all solutions like leeches. Modern medicine and mixed-martial arts improved so quickly because they are enlightened and therefore limiting individual fighters, or patients, pain is their ultimate sign of success or failure.

That book does the same for politics.

If a person can train using different fighting techniques from many multiple martial arts disciplines, and doctors can refer their patients to specialists from other disciplines, why can't we also be self-aware enough, and respectful enough, to mix and match ideologies according to their strengths and weaknesses in solving a specific problem?

To enlighten our politics in such a way, we only have to accept no ideology is complete. Like in medicine or Ultimate Fighting, any ideological technique must be evaluated based on evidence of their real-world results and not ideological purity.

The biggest obstacle to mixed-ideological politics is the same as it was for mixed-martial arts. Ideological pundits, teachers, and commentators see their beliefs and techniques as the single source of truth. Such a outlook can never embrace being just another niche a person could try. To avoid the open competition of natural selection, ideologues ramp up their storytelling.

To escape their spell of ideological echo chambers, we must understand the magic of great stories.

## Cinderella

- how to see through echo chambers so we can mix and match them.

The classic fairytale _Cinderella_ is a great example of how to hook an audience.

The movie tells the story of a beautiful, diligent, and kind-hearted country girl named Cinderella. An unloved orphan, she lives with her cruel stepfamily and does all the chores for her wicked stepmother and her two spoiled stepsisters. Cinderell's made friends with the local animals, but dreams of a better life and a chance to find happiness.

She’s ecstatic when she learns that the King is hosting an extravagent ball to find a bride for his charming son. Cinderella's friends help her sew a dress for what's sure to be the most wonderful night of her life. But her evil family forbids her, mocks her uppitiness, and tears her dress to shreds.

The young girl is on the verge of tears. But just as despair is about to set in, her fairy godmother appears. With a flick of her wand, the godmother transforms Cinderella’s ragged clothes into a dazzling gown and a pair of sparkling glass slippers. The fairy's magic also creates a carriage and a team of horses so that her goddaughter will finally have a night she’ll never forget.

At the party, Cinderella captivates everyone with her beauty and grace, especially the Prince. The two glide across the floor and whisper sweet nothings in each other’s ears. Sadly, the spell that gave Cinderella her magical night ends, forcing the shy orphan to flee from the ballroom, leaving the Prince with nothing but a glass slipper to remember her by.

The heartbroken Prince is determined to find his true love and orders his men to search the entire kingdom for the girl who fits the slipper.

They eventually get to Cinderella’s house. The wicked stepmother has gotten wise that her stepdaughter is the Prince’s heartthrob, and so locks her in the attic. Cinderella's friends come to her rescue, steal the key, and open the attic door just in time for Cinderella to ask the Prince’s men if she can try on the glass slipper. Then, just as she’s about to, the evil stepmother smashes the precious mememto.

To which Cinderella responds by revealing she has the other slipper.

And the rest is history.

The movie _Cinderella_ was very popular when it was released. It's popular today. And it'll be popular hundreds of years from now when humanity is (hopefully) travelling the stars. People will always like it because everyone can sympathize with a warm hearted person overcoming obstacles and bullies, to improve her life

People love stories. We can't get enough of them. A good story lets us experience the drama, trials, and lessons another person. From horrible brushes with death, to whimsical romances, stories gift us the experience of many lives during our limited time on Earth.

Stories pass-on so much information because they create a complete reality. This starts with the props that fill the storyworld with items, from cups to homes, we expect to see in any world. Next, there is music to relay the emotions of characters in the story. The dialogue of the story communicates what each character wants in an easy to understand way. Then there's the villain who earns their title because he likes the world the way it is and defends it against change. Next comes the philosophy of the story world that dictates the rules everyone in the story is presumed to live by, for example Cinderella is supposed to obey her stepmother. Cinderella defines what a hero is by disrearding the ruling philosphy and envisioning a better world for herself. And at the top of this story pyramid are tools; a catchall term for the real objects, from slippers to Death Stars, that are above being regular props, because they are the levers of power that control what happens in the story world.

The challenge of good storytelling is mixing these incredients together. When done properly, the resulting "cake" will transfix audiences and arise strong emotions and lasting commitments.

---

And that brings us back to echo chambers and our need to escape today's ideological ones.

Dismantling echo chambers starts by realizing the story of _Cinderella_ isn't about a girl controlled by her evil step-family. The fairytale is also not about a girl overcoming her evil step-family to marry her prince charming.

The story of _Cinderella_ is about a girl overcoming her step-family using levers of powers, i.e. tools.

If Cinderella doesn't get the horses, carriage, and evening dress from her fairy godmother, she'll never get into the ball. If the Prince didn't find her lost slipper, she'd never see him again. If the imprisoned girl's allies didn't steal the key to the attic, she'd never get out in time. And if Cinderella didn't have the second glass slipper, her name would be famous as a tragedy instead of a fairytale.

Cinderella had a problem, and it wasn't that her step-family were terrible people, nor was it that the rules of society were unjust. Her problem was that her terrible step-family controlled the tools Cinderella needed to improve her life.

Tools are the lever of power in every story. From _Star Wars_ to _The Matrix_, stories start with the villians controlling the tools while using the ruling philosophy to justify their control. The hero suffers an injustice that lets them see a problem with the ruling philosophy. The drama of the story is heroes and villains battling to control the tools needed to change the world. The winner implements their philsophy and changes or reaffirms the world in their image.

If you were to draw our Cinderlla, this is what it looks like.

- Starting Reality - Cinderella is an orphane living with a hateful stepfamily.
- Hero insight - Cinderella decides to disobey her cruel stepmother and attend the ball.
- Back and forth drama - Cinderella, stepmother, and and their respective allies, battle to control evening ware, invitations, attic keys, glass slippers, and other levers of power.
- New reality - The winner, Cinderella, marries her prince charming and becomes a princess.

Notice that how a person uses a lever of power reveals their true philosophy. For example, even though the stepmother says she cares for Cinderella, when she rips Cinderella's gown, locks her in the attic, and destroys the slipper, she's using tools to alter the world, letting us see the philosophy of oppression in her heart.

To showcase how tools determine one's philosophy, think of Cinderella locked inside the dusty and cramped attic. The Prince's men are looking for her and if she can try on the slipper, her horrible life will change forever. So, what if her friends failed getting the key to her prison but did get her a match?

Now the oppressed girl has some soul searching to do. Lighting a fire could get the Prince's mens attention, but the philsophy of possibly buring the house down, and killing herself and others, even to earn her freedom, is a different philosophy then getting some friends to steal a key and open a door.

The effects our tools have in the world determines the philosophy we believe in. 

Another important thing to learn from stories is that once they end, the hero and villian are no longer main characters. We don't need to hear from Cinderella after she marries the Prince because "they lived happily ever after". As for the stepmother, she's no more tools to attack Cinderella with, and is thus no longer a threat worthy of attention.

Tools being levers of power, philosophy being the effect of tools, and main characters having a limited shelf-life, are the facts those who sell themselves, and their philosophy, as being the eternal single source of truth that will solve all your problems, don't like.

- the stepmother used the rules to keep Cinderella inside them. When Cinderella stopped arguing using those rules, and reached for a tool to earn her freedom, the stepmother showcased her true philosophy.

## Mixed Ideologies Come By Ending Stories

- echo chambers end when we change tools, so we automatically mix and match them when we change tools.

>That's hardly a scientific observation Commander.

>Caption, the most elementary and valuable statement in science, the beginning of wisdom is, "I do not know". I do not know what this is sir.

_Lt. Commander Data_ [Star Trek](https://youtu.be/8eDYVtPwWiM)

When someone is telling you a story, and the hero and villian, and their philosophies, never go into the sunset, you're being sold an echo chamber. You are being told a unnatural story because there is no conclusion; just endless pages waiting to be filled with your time and money.

Echo chambers don't like conclusions because they force an assessment on whether the hero, his philosophy, and his chosen tools changed the world or not. Today's ideologues are not mixed-martial artists, doctors, or scientists searching for the best possible tools and techniques needed to fix your problem. Rather, ideologues are like salesman selling their chosen tools and techniques.

One ideology says green technology is a must buy to secure a properous future, while another says it's the enemy going to drive your family into debt. One ideology says gun ownership is killing innocent lives, another says they are saving you from tyranical government. One side says government run healthcare is the only option for a healthy society, while another says corporate health-care is your only hope to stay alive.

And on and on the fued continues over cablee news show and society at large. Tools are considered black or white because they are like fighting disciplines before mixed-martial arts; they sell themselves and their tools as being complete disciplines that can solve everyone of your problems. And by proclaiming their ideological rulesbook is perfect, they never have to admit any shortcomings.

Remember, it was only when curious people said, "what descipline is best?" and engaged in real fights and looked at the evidence, that the illusion of completeness was erased from all but the most stubborn martial arts. By allowing any technique Ultimate Fighting gave martial artists the freedom to bypass useless rules, be their own hero, and get better results.

Today's ideologues don't have that freedom yet. Since we don't practice mixed-ideological politics, our ideologies must project a completeness. Therefore they sell echo chambers.

To escape echo chambers, all you must do is understand when a mixed-martial arts enters a boxing gym, he's not being disloyal to his wrestling coach. When a family doctor refers you to a physiotherapist, she's not disloyal to medical doctors. When a biologist says "I don't know, ask a chemist" she's not being a bad biologist. This is because these fields understand they are sub-disciplines that exists to help a person solve a problem using any tool needed.

Fighters overcome opponents. Patients battle diseases. Scientists research nature. Cinderella had an evil stepfamily.

What's your problem? And what tools do you need to solve it.

If you're willing to consider any tool, from a handgun to a solar panel, to solve your problem, you're on the way to mixed-ideological politics. If you think any tool is "off limits", you're at least partially stuck inside an echo chamber. You should want the freedom to choose. Not only because it's proven so succesful in modern medicine and mixed-martial arts, but because it makes you a hero of evolution.

And evolution has no limits, respects no rules, and declares no kings.

## There is No Lion King - Evolution

- changing techniques/tools is evolution. changing tools is technological evolution.

We weren't the first species to live on Earth and we probably won't be the last. Life has survived billions of years without depending on any species. There's nothing special about any creature. We each survive and thrive according to the same laws of evolution.

Life needs evolution because the Universe is a hostile place that's. It's always changing; mountains fall apart, volcanoes erupt, stars emit radiation, heat is lost, waves wash away shorelines. To respond to the ever changing environment, Life must evolve a never ending stream of new species.

Those who survive do so because their combination of attributes gives them an edge. But, as the Universe inevitably changes, some traits lose their advantage. Thus, while evolution is a constant race to harvest resources as efficiently as possible, no one ever knows if their list of adaptions are good enough to keep them alive. That's why pain hurts so much; Life is telling individuals to change their behavior and try something else before it's too late.

Evolution has these laws:

 - No species survives forever.
 - All lifeforms have a common ancestry.
 - Evolution of new species is gradual.
 - The number of species always multiplies to fill niches.
 - Natural selection determines which species lives on.
 - Mayr pg. 86

These laws oversee every evolutionary race. The first sprint started after a few amino acids combined to form the first cells 3.6 billion years ago. That moment gave Life its start. Since then evolution has continually created new species. Each based on the one prior, but each removing and/or adding traits hoping to find an edge. The new trait could mean getting bigger, faster, stronger to outcompete another creature. Or, the new trait could be further specialization to hopefully find a niche no one else has, such as polar bears hunting seals on a frozen ecosystem.

Regardless what new adaption an organism tries, evolution's selection of the best adaptions requires a daily and hour scrutinizing, throughout the world, of every adaption, even the slightest. The best way to continually test species is with ecosystems. By putting creatures inside a shared environment, there are always checks and balances. When any scavenger, predator, herbivore, and omnivore falls behind, Life is ready to create individual or species to take its place.

![Elephant Speciation](/assets/speciation-elephants.png)
_Here's one example of how a species evolve. Mayr pg 176._

Although evolution has given rise to countless species over billions of years, the story of Life is well organized. That's because Life works so hard to adapt to its surroundings, so we can easily track evolution using Earth's geological changes (p.58). Each period, epoch, and age of Earth's geography, from the Jurassic to the Paleozoic, has different characteristic like concentration of oxygen in the air, water in the oceans, ice in the poles. These changes  required new species and thus serve as chapters in the story of Life.

While Life's evolution was relatively seemless betwen each chapter, species often had agonzing endings. Every single time Earth's geology changed was like a climatic conclusion asking if a individual's list of adaptations were needed in the changed enviroment. The few who passed the test climbed the ladder to the next age, while the majority of adaptations went round in circles, stubbornly fighting their inevitable extinction; their existence only remembered as fossils to maybe be uncovered one day.

![Evolutionary Spiral](/assets/speciation-elephants.png)
_The Evolutionary Spiral in the [history of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_evolutionary_history_of_life). From the perspective of Life it's seemless, but for lifeforms there are often tragic endings._

This summary misses the details of evolution. But the essence is here, which is Life must adapt to Earth's ever changing environment. The faster the better, no interference is justifiable, innovate or die. If all the resources on Earth had a body, evolution is the tailor creating custom lifeforms to harvest each one. Constant unfettered evolution is the only reason why Earth isn't just another rock revolving a star with no one to notice how beautiful the Universe is.

And, now we understand why echo-chambers are doomed. They presume their adaptation can be eternal. They commit themselves to one tool and antagonize the evolution of new adaptions by telling stories of their tool's supposed perfection. Evolution of course doesn't care what we tell ourselves. Leaving those inside echo chambers to reconile the stories they passionately believe in against the pain they feel in the real world as they walk around in circles unable to harvest enough resources to be happy and healthy.

Evolution is our way out. Unfettered innovation explains why modern-medicine, mixed-martial arts, and even characters like Cinderella are so successful. They each adapt to their situation by examining their problem before deciding on a technique or tool. With this freedom of mind, they can try any tool until they've solved their problem, and thereby harness the power of evolution.

With one big difference. Human evolution, and our adaptations, aren't biological.

## Old Age, Ladder Climb, Final Frontier

- We live on thes same evolutionary tree as biology, but with technology.

- The whole trick of evolution is finding the perfect adaptation. And no one can predict what that is. You just must respond to failure with another adaption as quickly as possible. The rest, like caring about gender, is all noise.

>Not always, Scar. One day, it’ll be my son who rules. Simba will be your king.”
_Mufasa_ 

[The Lion King](https://www.quoteambition.com/the-lion-king-quotes/)

The Boston Symphony had a problem. There was a lot of men in their ranks. That wasn't the problem though. The problem was they didn't know why. There were plenty of talented female musicians auditioning, yet not many were making the cut.

You might be thinking, make the audition blind. But it already was, no judge could see the musicians perform. Now you might be thinking, well, I guess that's it, the males were just better.

Instead of accepting that observation, the symphony tried something else. The judges asked the musicians to take their shoes off before walking to the audition stage. Now the judges couldn't see them, nor hear their shoes.

And within a few years, the symphony was about equal men and women.

The sounds of the shoes was triggering a bias in the both male and female judges. By removing everything but the music, they heard only the music, and got a better product for their audiences.

That's a good little story. As we learned above, humans love stories. It's how we make sense of the world and pass-on our knowledge.

Yet, that is also our problem. We can understand cause and effect so easily that stories come naturally to us. But that doesn't mean we're good at reasoning which stories are real or fake. We can just as easily believe in a false story, as did the judges who heard footsteps instead of music.

The whole trick of evolution is finding the perfect adaptation. And no one can predict what that is. You just must respond to failure with another adaption as quickly as possible. The rest, like caring about gender, is all noise.

But with our inability to tell the difference between real and fake stories, we believe in and listen to stories like _The Lion King_, where Simba is set to inherit the territory and pride of his father Mufasa, much to the chagrin of Scar, Mufasa's conniving brother.

No other animal on the planet could make any sense of this story. The idea of a person inheriting a gold medal in the race of evolution is impossible; nature declares no kings.

And this is our problem. It's the problem of all politics.

We are lifeforms in nature. When we invent new tools, we continue Life's evolution, but with technology instead of biology. There is effectively no difference. Life wants adaptations that can harvest resources and procreate and doesn't care what the material composition is anymore than a composer cares what gender his violinist is.

Our technological evolution follows the same laws as regular evolution.

 - No technology survives forever.
 - All technology has a common ancestry.
 - Evolution of new tools is gradual.
 - The number of tools always multiplies to fill niches.
 - Natural selection determines which tools lives on.

Our story evolution requires innovators who take on the burdeun of creating the endless new species Life needs to stay alive. This is what happened during the creation of judo, boxing, wrestling and the other martial arts. These are all distinct species that master a certain technique.

Once there are enough "species", they can fill an ecosystem, and it's time to harness evolution with a philosophy that teaches humans to anaylze the situation and select the best technique to solve the problem being encountered. That's what mixed-martial arts is, it evolution in the minds of its practioners.

But as we found out, evolution isn't always met with open arms. Instead we more often get stories like _The Lion King_, about how an individual and his tools is beyond evolution and shouldn't have to run the daily race like everyone else. This was the struggle mixed-martial arts had to overcome, the ceaseless stories...

Yet, think of this. In all the world's ecosystems, no two species speaks the same language, yet everyone works together to keep Life alive. Bees and fruit trees don't talk, yet together they arrange the time to flower and harvest the pollen....

Species communicate not with words, but with tools and products. Things that each can make that help the other harness resources better. When Cinderella was locked in the attic, she didn't need to tell her friends what she needed, but her problem defined her solution; ie. the key to the door.

But, what if you can't make a helpful product? In nature, species who can't cut it are automatically erased from the list of competitors. But no so in humans. The victors of the last race aren't (yet) required to re-run it again the next time. Instead, they can turn humans ability to reason against us, but telling a story of The Lion King.

That's why we need mixed-ideological politics.

As stated above, evolution is tracked in ages. For humans those ages are the eras of new technology.

  - Bronze Age: 	2000 - 1250
  - Iron Age:  		1250 - 550
  - Classic Age:  	550 - 476
  - Middle Ages: 	500 - 1439
  - Renaissance: 	1440 - 1686
  - Science Age: 	1687 - 1759
  - Industrial Age: 1760 - 1969
  - Digital Age: 	1970 - 

And the Industrial Age is like the Cambrian explosion, the time that biologists call the "Big Bang" of evolution because Life had advanced enough to supply so many new species.

 We have so many different technologies that just wanted to have fun in the sun.

However, before you can drop and pick up tools willy nilly as the Enlightened representative of Evolution, you must do something truly historic for the good of all humanity.

Yes, you must leave echo chambers and adopt mixed-ideological politics. Yes, you must be like Cinderella and pickup whatever tools helps improve your future. But to do these things you must do what Life has done so many times before.

Climb the ladder.

See, in the story of Life, the constant change in the environment requires a constant change in species. Species are their list of adaptions. Biologically speaking, there isn't much difference between a sabre tooth tiger and a mountain lion, but one walks the Earth and the other is in museums.

- mammal/bird parents pass-on knowledge.
  - we can't learn from parents as we're in a new age.
  - new age equals new frontier.
  - Mayr 253.
- Large populations are inert and don't evolve fast.
  - Founder populations face more selective pressure b/c environment is novel, thus evolve faster.
  - Mayr pg 193.

It's not easy. The biggest problem isn't the heights or the effort, it's the fact you've got to leave most of your past behind. New ages need new adaptions, tools, and philosophies.

Evolution is a constant stream of new species. The story of Life is series of short stories therefore a never ending series of conclusions. And you're part of that story, and we've hit a new age.


Both sides agree to keep consuming to maintain themselves. One said wants to print more money, the other wants to conserve. One side wants to consume more natural resources, the other wants to conserve. The result is, a tactical compromise to keep consuming. Because each represetns a bygone lifeform whose list of attributes isn't up to the task of evolution and is scrambling to survive.
