## Quote

_We are really the revolutionaries in the world today—not the kids with long hair and beards who were wrecking the schools a few years ago._

Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, 1973.

## Dedication

For the people in the open-source community. For the unspoken philosophy you handed down to me. For caring so unconditionally when updating Wikipedia, writing free software, and building cool new tech for us all. For showing me who the protagonists are. It’s the best education a political guy can get. I hope I learned enough.

For the antagonists, the self-entitled delegators keeping Blockbuster alive, thanks for causing history to repeat itself yet again. I hope you learn something.

To the extras. When it's time for you to act, I pray you pick the right side.

## The Beginning

It all started with a door in the face. I few more actually. I'm either too stubborn or too hopeful. Either way, I eventually learned my lesson. I was selling a product upper management were never going to buy.

Before you wonder, it wasn't the price, there was no price. It wasn't the competition. None of that either. And I can promise it worked, because I had spent years in a cubicle doing the frontline job it worked for.

I figured out how to solve a problem—and save 100 million dollars, 300,000 hours of productivity, and even several lives—with an app that was virtually free. All I wanted was to give it away. After years of working on political and economic theory, I’ve written (another) book about the untapped possibilities of new tech like apps, bio-monitors, and bitcoin. I wanted real-world proof, and maybe get some real-world credentials, to help validate my ideas.

But I was a fool. I wasn’t even knocking on doors. I was knocking on gates. See, I wasn’t talking to the frontline workers suffering through the problem I solved, but the bureaucrats, lawyers, managers, and executives, who were paid to “deal” with those problems. Solving their problems was asking them to fire themselves. The gates were in place to shut out innovation.

In fact, they never said _no_ to me. _No_ needs a reason. Instead, they said it was against the rules to say yes. Obscure rules, hidden inside regulations and contracts. They believed in these rules, especially the one against letting frontline workers to decide for themselves.

I'm not going to talk about my experience too much. All that's important is there was a problem, a big one wasting millions of your dollars, weeks of workers time (lots of it unpaid overtime), and maybe even your life, and it was against the rules to solve it.

## The Power Of Stories

Do you love stories? I think it’s a safe bet to say that you do. Who doesn’t? They entertain us after a hard day of work, bring us together to share our joys, and (my favorite) open our minds to the different rules and philosophies of foreign cities, mythical worlds, and galaxies far far away.

Stories are so powerful because they’re so simple. Protagonists are good because they want to fix a problem. Antagonists are bad because they don’t. Stories aren’t debates. We take the protagonist’s side. Thus, Romeo and Juliet’s love is beautiful and worth dying for, while their families’ feud is ignorant and stupid. Luke Skywalker’s rebellion is good and worth fighting for, while Darth Vader’s empire is wicked and should be destroyed.

Our moral clarity about a problem turns the protagonists into our heroes and the antagonists into our villians. We thus follow their story with strong emotions, which burst out at the climax, where we find out who wins.

Our hero fights hard to defeat the story’s problem, but his superior morality, justice, and heroism isn’t enough. He’s often too weak or unskilled, and the villian beats him bloody. On the verge of failure, the hero needs to find something, something that’ll turn the tide. He searches, sees, and reaches for his salvation: a tool or a weapon—whether it’s a gun, magic book, or lightsaber.

Will our hero reach it first, or will the enemy? We in the audience, like extras in the story, hold our breath because the story’s society is controlled not by desires, opinions, or rules, but by which character holds the tools. The wielder is the victor. The victor writes the rules. It’s a lesson we need to learn for ourselves.

## A New Empowering Philosophy Called Techvolution

The rules. We think they control us. They don’t. I'll show you why.

Talk to any political junkie, no matter when, and they’ll say there’s a big election coming up. They’ll say something like “if the red team wins this one, then education, healthcare, infrastructure, and everything else will go to shit.” What he means is elections decide the rule makers, and that blue rules are good while red rules are evil.

If you buy it—and most of us have at some point—you watch blue cable news, read blue blogs, listen to blue talk radio. You fill your head with blue’s philosophy. Soon enough, your face is painted blue, you’re waving a blue bristol board while yelling blue chants at rallies, marches, and protests. You feel like a hero! You’re fighting against the evil red philosophy!

Let me ask you, if you’re a regular middle-class person, and you ignored the election, how much would you bet, that you would know who won, just by living your life.

I mean today, when team blue wins, does traffic suddenly disappear? When team red wins, does everyone suddenly eat healthy? Do you breathe fresher air, or see healthier neighbors, i.e. do your real-life problems get solved, when one color’s philosophy writes the rules?

If you think regulations, laws, and marches change the world; if you think the red vs blue storyline decides the future of our society, you can stop reading. There’s lots of blogs, shows, and books waiting to sing to their choir, telling you to fight the enemy until you’re blue in the face.

If you don’t like the choir, or you’re starting to realize the "other side" is part of the same struggling middle class, you’d probably like to keep reading. I wrote this book for you.

Whichever color wins an election today and re-writes the regulations, laws, and rules, regular people will still pay taxes, have a mortage, waste hours in traffic, pay increasing energy bills, under sleep, buy unhealthy food, watch climate change, overpay for questionable education, get pushed around by their health insurance, endure customer abuse, work unpaid overtime, still get micro-managed, and hope their job (which they likely hate) isn’t downsized or outsourced.

Under blue or red rules, the struggling middle class lifestyle stays the same, because the tools in which we live our lives, like suburban homes, gas cars, call centres, centralized power stations, paper based tax forms, mass produced unhealthy food, occasional doctor check ups, television for entertainment, an insatible education industry, and everything else in suburban America and Canada, stays the same.

There's a reason Skywalker and Vader don't fight over a rule book. A reason why we go to a mechanic to fix our cars. Or contractors to make our porches. Tools change lives.

Likewise, the rules, no matter what color, don’t control us. The tools we ues to live our life with do. And nothing changes in our daily life if either red and blue write the rules, because neither’s philosophy—from conservatism to progressivism, capitalism to Marxism—is about putting new tools into our hands.

It’s not our politicians fault. The philosophies they follow were invented before we had the tools to improve our lives. Back the, horses, carriages, and sailboats were their transportation. Abacuses and chalkboards did their calculations. The moon lite their way to outdoor latrine pits. Humanity had primitive tools when red and blue were born; their philosophical fathers like Adam Smith, Edmund Burke, John Stuart Mill, Karl Marx, never listened to music, read an eBook, made a phone call, opened a fridge, used electronics, had a genetic test, santized their wounds, took penicillin, knew about electricity, started a motor, learned about evolution, or typed on a keyboard. Yet we let these thinkers ideas guide us in the digital age.

Red and blue philosphies were invented to group humanity into a massive collection action. With red and blue philosophies our farming ancestors came together, industrialized, and built the first rudimentary tools like steam engines, gas cars, indoor toilets, broadcast televisions, and computers the size of rooms. The masses needed to be extras, regulated and managed inside simplistic color coded parties because our tools were so primitive we took turns holding them. Thus, we couldn’t share with everyone but had to regulate access. To their credit, blue and red philosophies at least gave extras a voice in how our tools’ factories, regulations, and profits were controlled.

Yet today with live in a world far far away from primitive tools. Digital tools are so easy to make that we can customize them for every person’s individual problems. Technologies like high-speed internet, smartphones, machine learning, computer programming, cloud computing, bluetooth, heart rate monitors, 3D printing, genetic tests, air quality sensors, GPS trackers, smart watches, finger-print scanners, thermal cameras, have made tools like Skype, iPhones, Lyft, WhatsApp, Kickstarter, YouTube, 23 and Me, ButcherBox, blood tests, Khan Academy, Google Wear, GitHub, SquareSpace, AirBnB, and Firefox so extremely powerful and so easy to make, we don’t need to fight to control them, but fight to spread them. This doesn’t come naturally to us, however, because the rules of old philosophies are based on fighting over, not sharing, tools.

Techvolution is a new philosphy about making regular people the hero of their own story. It does so by empowering them with new tools.

With Techvolution, you won’t fight political battles with bristol boards or painted faces. You’ll economically exercise your right to speak your mind and vote your conscious, by deciding which tools best solve your problem at home and work. Unlike me, you’ll never need to deal with any gatekeepers, because you won’t have to knock at anyone’s door asking permission to do what’s best for you.

I’m not talking about an idealic world from storytime. This place of sharing tools already exists. Wikipedia, YouTube, StackOverflow, VS Code, GitHub, Linux, Mozilla are only a few examples of the wonderful world of cooperation that exists today. It’s called the open-source community because software and ideas are “openly shared” to help create new tools. Millions of creators and contributors, designers and coders, who don't care about a persona's title but only how well a person solves problems, are already working and living inside a fundamentally new story that’s responsible for our online world. I only want to rid our society of old philosophies holding it back, to let these protagonists prosper.

People often say regular people are addicted to our phones. We aren’t. Checking news feeds, downloading ping-pong games, taking endless photos, is regular people toying around with our new tools to learn what they can do. Our ancestors did the same with printed books, telescopes, and muskets. Soon enough they were empowered to read, ee the Universe for themselves, and fight tyrants. We toy with new tools before we use them to change the world.

We're not addicted to our phones. We're learning to use our new tool. When a new philosophy turns them on they become lightsabres. For us today, that’s Techvolution.

# ACT ONE

## Introduction

Fighting to spread the power of new tools is an archetypal human story. Galileo fought a religious establisment with a telescope, George Washington fought a political establishment with a musket, and Steve Jobs fought a economic establishment with an iPod.

Likewise, I want to empower you with tools. Yet, this is not a book about how to invent tools. Amazing books like _Rework_ and _Zero to One_ already do that. Nor is it a book about the history of invention. _The Innovators_ does that better than I could dream. If you want brilliant critiques of our society, _The Incerto_ and _The Great Degeneration_ are already waiting for you. Instead, this is a book about how new tools empower society, and how we can distribute their power to improve the lives of regular people today.

It all comes down to changing the rules of our society with a new philosophy. Todays philosophies don’t mix well with modern technology. They consider us, the middle class, as extras. People who are just around to watch the story unwind around them. Even if we watch our problems pile up at home and at work, we’re not supposed to solve them until we pass through the gatekeepers of old tools in government bureaucracies, bloated corporations, high-end lawyer offices, or endless consultant meetings. This is the equivalent of Blockbuster writing rules to protect itself and keep on reigning in an era of YouTube and Netflix; basically, the opposite of evolution.

Techvolution is inspired by Nature. Notice gatekeeper’s don’t exist there. Evolution doesn’t have anyone telling a cheetah she’s running too fast, that the ants are too cooperative, or that a camel is too water efficient. Lifeforms adapt as best they can to their own problems and the winners survive. There are no middleman, no gatekeepers, just problem solvers. And the problem solvers prevail.

However, human biological adaptions take thousands of years, so ours have effectively stopped. We'll never biologically evolve to fly, do advanced calculations, or breath Martian air. Humanity continues life's evolution with tools. We're basically cyborgs who adapt and solve problems by upgrading our tools to the lastest problem in transportation, calculation, and breathing. Hold a pen, calculator, smarthphone, plane joystick, space suit, and you're a different cyborg each time.

However, our problem solving is held back by old philosophies that empower gatekeepers. People in control of old tools like Blockbuster, getting to decide when, and if, humanity will upgrade our tools.

In _Star Wars_, the Force is an all powerful energy field. Luke Skywalker's Jedi warriors harness the light side to help others. Darth Vader's evil Sith harness the dark side to help themselves.

We call technological protagonsts "trailblazers". Like Jedi, they empower us cyborgs with new tools. But since some gates are good, like the security ones, we don't have a political name for the antagonists. Thus, I call antagonists to our technological evolution Darth Blockbuster. They are the people who prevent human evolution for their self-interest.

Biological upgrades and adaptions is called evolution. I call human technological evolution _Techvolution_. This book is about inventing Techvolution, a philosophy to re-write the rules of society, to kill Darth Blockbuster, so regular people can solve our problems with technological upgrades as smoothly in human society, as natural selection does in nature.

And to make it happen, you, the current extra, have to join the fight. Human evolution depends on you picking the right side between a old ruling philosophy filled with rules to keep your problems alive, and this new one that says solving your real-life problems makes you a hero.

## Cast of Ideas and Characters

Before we go any futher, I want to lay out the philosophy of Techvolution more clearly. To do so, here are a few terms that will enable us to all be on the same page:

===

Philosophy: the largely unspoken ideals that tell members of society what’s right and wrong, good and bad, in science, art, morals, politics and economics. Philosophy is a civilization's collective consciousness used by members to make rules around questions like: what is scientific truth? Who should govern? And how should resources be organized?

Ruling philospophy: is a civilization’s chosen philosophy. One that all factions agree on. Like the “Divine Rights of Kings” derived from Christian theology used in royalist Europe, “Marxist-Leninism” of the Soviet Union, or the combination of “red / blue” philosophies of our philosophy today.

Rule book: the largely unspoken etiquette, workplace, and social rules that govern everyday life. The rule book is interpreted from the ruling philosophy.

Technology: a catchall term for things we make tools from, like concrete, lumber, nails, shingles, insulation, and bricks.

Tool: a catchall term for things we create with technology to solve a problem, like guns to kill bad guys, books to record and pass on knowlege, and houses to shelter in.

Frontline: The point of contact between a tool and the problem. A movie usher talking to moviegoers, nurses giving vaccines, cleaners cleaning a city bus, police chasing a robber, soldiers on the battlefield. People on the frontline have jobs to solve problems.

Hierarchy: Every tool develops a power structure to manage its use in society. Kings and queens having the keys to the castle for example. People in the hierachy have titles like prince and executive to mark their position inside the power structure.

The story of civilization: The invention of new technology and creation of new tools to overcome whatever problem troubles us. We use tools to evolve.

Protagonists: people who invent, spread, and use new technology and new tools for the greater good. Usually close to the problems on the frontline, they individually struggle, but their continued self-sacrifice slowly improves life on Earth. I call them Jedi, we call their leaders trailblazers who often skirt the rules; Nikola Tesla, Steve Jobs, Michael S. Hart, Bill Gates, Linus Torvalds, Elon Musk.

Antagonists: people who selfishly resist new tools to defend their wealth, power, and prestige. Often called establishment or elites, antagonists usually manage companies or institutions based on dated technologies and think working on the frontline is beneath them. They work to control the rule book so they can hide behind it. We don't often individually identify them. I invented "Darth Blockbuster" so we can.

Extras: everybody in the middle of a battle between antagonist and protagonist. Because they have no direct loyalty to either side or their tools, extras can pick winners and losers. Usually extras are in the middle class; not so poor as to be desperate, but not so powerful they want to keep the world the same. Sadly, extras don't realize their power.

The Death Star: The rule book when its controlled by Darth Blockbuster. Today it exists inside countless government regulations, laws, and corporation manuals, that prevent new tools being used by people.

Techvolution: a new philosophy empowering seemless human technological evolution by ridding Darth Blockbuster of his power, by empowering extras to decide when society should upgrade our tools.

## Nice to Meet You, Skywalker

And the story is about to begin. Not in a foreign city, mythical world, or galaxy far far away. Right here and now, where ever you are on this Earth. We need to change our ruling philosophy to take advantage of digital tools. Only you can make it happen.

A little about me first. I'm nobody special. In my youth I was a cleaner, drywaller, movie usher/projectionist, and die-hard ideologue. After dropping that bad habit, I studied political philosophy and innovation at the University of Toronto, usually while working full-time. However, I learned far more about innovation on the frontline as a line worker, an account manager, a claims adjuster. I was the co-worker you sometimes forget about because they just do their job. Making an app and meeting my personal Darth Blockbuster was an education unto itself. All this taught me Techvolution. Watching friends struggle using, owning, maintaining, and working with the old tools of an old philosophy motivated me to write it down for you.

So that's a snapshot. But I'm not important. You are. Because from hospital cleaners, to internet technical support, nursing to adjusting, only workers on the frontline know the tools our society needs to fix our many problems.

So although today you're an extra in the battle between Jedi and Sith, you are the hero of Techvolution. It's not surprising. Average joes are always the heroes. Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Neo, and Cinderella were regular people. They became heroes when called upon to defeat the bad guys.

Now you're called upon. Like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Morpheus, or the fairy godmother, I'm merely the guide to teach you how to defeat the villians. So the time is now young Skywalker, to leave the farm, and join the rebellion.

What is the rebellion. It's definitely not rallies, marches, or protests. It's a rebellion of the mind. We have to change our ruling philosophy. We have to destroy the Death Star; Darth Blockbuster's rule book that keeps his old tools in power and prevents us all using new tools to solve frontline problems. When the Death Star is gone, the middle class will flourish once again. And that's worth fighting over.

# BLOWING UP THE DEATH STAR

## The Magic of Evolution

Well young Skywalker, before you go off and face Darth Blockbuster and blow up his Death Star, you have to learn some things. The most important being the all powerful energy field inside every lifeform. No not the Force. I'm talking about evolution.

Evolution empowers life by giving every new lifeform a slightly different variation. With variations life can constantly test for environmental changes in things like water levels, temperature, and food supply. The variations unfit for the frontline die off. The fittest survive. This natural selection is how evolution finds which lifeforms best represent life on Earth.

Evolutions works so well because it creates biodiversity. The more lifeforms there are, the more life can probe and therefore better adapt to environmental changes. When temperatures increase or rain patterns change, low biodiversity decreases respons times; high biodiversity increases it becacause more lifeforms feel the pain, and therefore life can sooner evovle a solution to the frontline problem.

However, if the environment is stable, lifeforms need a caretaker. Someone to keep them in shape, ready to act for when the environment does change. That's why nature put in a system of checks and balances called ecosystems. Inside ecosystems is where lifeforms form communities and cooperate keep each other on their toes.

Ecosystems are a food chain of different plants, herbivores, carinvores, and decomposers. Each lifeform checks the other's excesses and makes sure everyone reciprocates to keep the ecosystems' nutrients flowing. Checks, balances, and reciprocation is how ecosystems make sure life stays in shape and keeps evolving even in good times.

Evolution may not be the Force, but it's certainly magical. Without any lifeform being aware of its tricks, evolution turned a lifeless planet into an oasis. The big drawback is time. Biological variations can take millions of years to respond to environmental changes. Think of the poor polar bears. They'll never understand why the ice isn't coming. And even if they could, no lifeform can proactively change their biology.

In contrast, humanity can change (hopefully in time to help the polar bears). Not our biology. But our "cyborgology" if you will, because we feel frontline pain, reflect on the problems causing them, and can create a new tool to overcome.

Techvolution is therefore intentional evolution. A better form of evolution that isn't a magical mystery, like evolution is to polar bears, but something we can understand. Question is, what drives us to evolve, when the rules often say it's wrong?

## The Majic of Techvolution

We call it genius when someone uses existing technology to make a new tool. Happily these trailblazers are self-motivated, and we already celebrate their genius and innovations. Heck, even Darth Blockbuster often loves their work. But innovation isn't the only step to Techvolution. Only when the extras use a tool do we evolve.

So what trick does nature play on the extras to use new tools and risk Darth Blockbuster's wrath. The answer is a trick inside our souls.

Unlike evolution, the trick is not magic, because extras understand they're dropping one tool and attaching another; like swapping out the DVD player for Netlix. Yet, there's still something wonderfully mystical about choosing to leave ones's comfort zone and learning a new cyborgolgy. It's like a desert fox putting on a swimsuit, attaching flippers, and slipping on swimming goggles and then diving into the ocean yelling "I can do this!".

Changing our tools is so wonderfully brave, mysterious, and difficult, I call it majic. Pronounced like magic, but different so we know it's the free choice of a regular person to upgrade to a new tool and continue humanity's evolution.

Think of majic like a bonding agent. Carbon atoms are sticky and thereby bond other atoms to form the Universe's many molecules. Genius in the protagonists minds bonds existing ideas into original ones. Good storytelling bonds audiences with different worlds and characters. And majic bonds people's minds and bosies with new tools.

Techvolution is the ruling philosophy letting extras majically bond with any tool so they can solve frontline problems. And when the rules say its wrong, we can get them out of the way with a short lesson.

![New Tool/majic](/img\diagrams\techvolution-majic.png)

* Note: Majić is my family name. I lucked out it reads like "magic" in english. It's egotistical to use it here I know, but I couldn't think of a better word. I'm especially using it for my parents. They've been overworked all their life yet still always cleaned and built stuff for other people with care. I wanted to retire them. Instead, I can name the act by which a regular person improves humanity in their name.

* Sticking it to my personal Darth Blockbuster makes me smile too.

## The Lesson

Despite our problems with our current one, society always needs a ruling philosophy. We use it to create the rules that glues society together so thousand or millions of us can work together.

That's why Darth Blockbuster fights to control the ruling philsoophy. When he does, he write rules to keep the tools he controls, and therefore himself, in power. Corporate manuals, univeristy guidelines, social justice blogs are among the pages of his Death Star rule book. These rules interfere with regular people majically bonding with new tools.

Maybe. Whose to know which rules are the bad ones. Maybe they're interfering with majic. Maybe they're just good rules. Darth Blockbuster doesn't tell people he's Darth Blockbuster. Instead he says he's an an Executive Vice President, Human Resources Representative, or expert lawyer. Are these people genuine authority figures protecting society, or Darth Blockbusters protecting their paychecks?

To answer that, we need to cleary identify he difference between majic and rules. This way we can filter out the good and bad rules in our everyday life. This lessons takes us to small farm in Maryland, and a young boy who worked hard to better himself.

===

Our story is about a Maryland farm boy named Frederick using tools to overcme ignorance. His farm is one of those you might have seen on shows like _Little House on the Prarire_. Salt of the earth farmers raising crops and families in 19th century rural America. No internet, no school systems, no much to learn by how to survive.

Frederick worked the fields with his mother. It was hard labour of course, there weren't many machines around, so he had to work hard, for himself and his mother.

In a few years, Frederick was sent to work with a relative in Baltimore. The house was large and the young family could use a hand cleaning, shopping, doing chores. It made his mother happy he wouldn't sweat so much, yet Frederick was a farmer and unsure of the big city.

The father of the house was Hugh. He wasn't around much. His new wife Sophia was. She was a foreigner used to colder climates who didn't know many people yet, so she stayed in a lot. Sophia was nice and treated Frederick nice too. Not as a farmer, but as a interesting person. She made Frederick feel at ease.

One day, Sophia handed Frederick a list of items to pick up from the store. Frederick's eyes looked down, his shoulders slouched, like a dog who disappointed its masters. Frederick mumbled "I can't read."

"My God, well that won't do!" Sophia responded, then continued "Reading is good. How else can a person give and receive information from... from... the world! I'll teach you, we'll do it together." So Sophia taught Frederick to read. Just a few weeks, and he got the basics. Sophia performed majic and was overjoyed.

Frederick even more so! Finally all those markings in the store, on street corners, in books, in newspapers, in the Holy Bible, mean something, a new world! Go left, turn right, open, closed, discounted, welcome, and Salvation, all a doors to a new world.

Now Frederick danced to the store, he whisked himself to do his chores, because he was learning to read a little more everyday. He loved how the world kept getting bigger, and information kept pouring in.

One day Hugh came home early. He saw Sophia and Frederick reading at the dinner table. Hugh walked into the room. "Boy, get out, and wait in the hallway. Face the wall."

Frederick got out, went outside, and faced the wall. Seconds turned to minutes. Frederick rolled the newspaper in his hands tighter. He didn't want to go back to the farm. But even more, he didn't want his angel to get in trouble.

Inside the room, Sophia was curious "What is it?". Hugh responded "This isn't Ohio...Darling you can't do that. We could get in a lot of trouble. You can't teach them to read."

Sophia responded "everyone learns to read in Ohio."

Hugh takes a seat. "This isn't a free State. He is a slave. What do you think happens when slaves read. Don't you think they'll start thinking." Sophia's eyes went wide. Hugh continued "It's against the rules to teach a slave to read.... now teach the boy."

As Frederick heard the hallway door open, he straightens up, and grips his newspaper.

Sophia says "Turn around."

Frederick does, and looks at his angel, the one who talked with him like he was a person. And she looked back and only saw _her boy_.

Sophia slapped the newspaper from her boy's hand. He didn't let go. She slapped again, and again and again. Each slap hurt more than a dozen whips on his scarred back.

She slapped, and slapped, and slapped, and slapped. She will not do evil. Sophia was clicked by society's rule book. Now she was a demon protector of vile racism to justify human slavery.

Frederick's world shutdown again. The one white person ignorant enough to treat him like a person, was now an educated convert to the rules that put him into chains. Physical chains if needed, but evil prefers mental chains of ignorance; they stay on so much easier.

Weeks later Frederick was in despair. His daily routine was the same. Yet, working under demonic masters is just different. He didn't dance to the store, he didn't whisk to do his chores, and he never saw Sophia smile again. Demons are always on guard.

One day while doing his chores, Frederick saw a newspaper, the avenue to knowledge whose path Fredereick was once on. He looked at the markings, saw some words he knew, and one word he didn't. Yet he still stared at it. Why?

The answer slapped him harder than the demon ever did, he read the words "The Free States in the North". He heard the word freedom before, but he didn't know freedom was a real place.

A shockwave went through him when he realized if slavery was a place, then so must freedom be a place too. Frederick realized he could break chains. Because ignorance was always his demon, and knowledge was always his angel. And he fought ignorance, and received knowledge, whenever he read.

So, Frederick taught himself to read. He practiced with ignorant white kids on the streets. He practiced reading items at the grocery store. He practiced on every street sign. And he practiced everytime he was at the Baltimore dock; the dock I said, you know the place, where ships will take you anywhere in the world. If you can read the schedule.

One day Sophia waited for her boy to return. But the boy died when the man Frederick Douglass walked onto the ship headed north to freedom. The man knew the exact time, place, and fare he needed to get on. He read it, himself, on the schedule. Reading opened the world to Frederick, and now the free world was opened to him.

The story gets better. Frederick Douglass becomes a brilliant orator and writer. In a world with no radio, video, or telephones, he travels the Northern States and Europe telling everyone the truth about slavery. When the American Civil War (1861-1865) broke out, his books helped Britain reject recognizing the South, and thus deprived it of much needed support. The irony of a slave educating people about slavery, and thereby helping to end slavery, is the cherry on top of this great story.

## Douglass' Lessons

Frederick Douglass is a true Jedi Master. His great bravery, persistence, and intelligence showcase humanity's endless potential. The big lesson we need to learn here Skywalker, is using majic to tell the difference between good and bad rules.

Sophia taught Douglass to read. She wasn't told to. She did it because whatever our joys are, from boxing, fishing, or reading, we naturally love teaching our chosen tools. We love it because Nature wants us spreading the majic to continue its evolution.

When a magician makes a playing card disappear, we smile in awe and childish wonder. That's really cool, but nothing new was created, so we soon lose our joy. However, when a majician connects someone with reading, they've similarly performed something awesome, but its not a trick; they've upgraded someone's cyborgology and effectively created a new and improved person. This makes us smile for a long time. Majic is Nature's long lasting dopamine fix.

Yet human made rules _sometimes_ say upgrading to a new tool is wrong. Medieval parishoners couldn't read a science book, peasant farmers couldn't have a musket, a 1990's kid couldn't download a digital song. Today millions of tired mothers can't telecommute. Why?

There is no easy answer. Society's rule book will never call itself a Death Star. Remember in no story does someone say their evil. The lesson Skywalker is it'll never be easy to know the difference between good and bad rules. Humans make rules too easily in speech, regulations, laws, to easily filter out the bad ones.

Majic is thus our best judge of the rules. It naturally makes us smile. From teaching a kid to walk, to teaching a grandmother to "Skype in" and watch her grandkids first steps; teaching and learning new tools opens our hearts because it solves problems and improves our way of life.

So, when you're teaching or learning a new tool and someone steps in your way with a rule, ask yourself if you feel majic, and if you do, ask the rulemaker why he doesn't. Perhaps there's a good reason. But keep Sophia in mind. Performing majic made her fell good, while following the rules only made her feel safe.

And safety is fleeting Skywalker. No ruling philosophy lasts forever, thus all rule books eventually expire. Majic never will. It always was, and always will be, in our souls. It's how we naturally test our rule book. Electricity, the microchip, the iPhone were all made by people who skirted the rules. Yet we celebrate their innovators (Tesla, Noyce, Jobs) today because they invented a new tool that let us feel and spread majic.

Ignore majic at your peril. Look at Sophia, she gave one of our greatest writers and orators his start, yet she lived a miserable life watching him succeed because she broke the rules. Which is better?

## A World With Little Majic

Skywalker, the extras are struggling. We already have Jedi in the open-source community creating new tools to solve frontline problems. We already have extras feeling the pain of frontline problems. What we don't have is the freedom of extras to majically form bonds with new tools. For that we need Techvolution.

But let's talk about the good news. There's always good news and it's vital to mention to fend off negativity and despair. It's safer to live now then in any other point in human history. The amount of us dying violent deaths has consistently gotten lower. In the Stone Age, about 10-20% of people died violently, most often by murder. In Rome's peak civilization it was around 2-5%. In the Dark Ages it was above 5%. But by the 18th century it was under 5% again. Now, less than 1% of us die violently. All because as civilization grows, we make better tools to improve our way of life.

More good news. We have enormously powerful digital tools that get better very quickly. This is mostly because it gets easier putting more transistors on the microchips that power digital tools. In 1972 a microchip had about 3,000 transistors. In 2018 they had 10 billion. In 46 years, we've increase computer power by three million percent.

It was with microchips that protagonists like Grace Hopper, Jay Last, and Al Alcorn created the first digital tools in the 1970's. And since then we're gotten many more tools like email, GPS, blogs, and smartphones.

And now for the bad news. Because of old philosophies, these new tools were seen as a threat not a salvation. Thus, Darth Blockbuster showed up and made his Death Star and wrote contracts nobody can understand, regulations nobody can read, and enforces politically correctness nobody likes. All to keep his primitive tools like gas cars, call-centres, paper-based tax forms, legalese regulations, and massive suburban housing, in use and himself in power.

Our society's biggest problems like personal isolation, political hatred, and climate change, are wounds of the Death Star's many attacks. But stay positive. We can solve them all when we liberate digital uses with Techvolution.

Let's look at some stats to better understand our wounds.

Moore's Law - Transistor's power electronics. They amount in a microchip can roughly double every two years. Although this will be ending soon, it's still given us lightsabres waiting to be turned on with Techvolution.

Social capital is the trust people have in each other. The more people socialize, the more trust they'll have with each other. It's often called "Bowling Alone". Technology has distracted us for sure, but our suburban, 9-5, car lifestyle is by far more responsible.

Attached to old philoosphies, government is inable to solve frontline problems. The public's trust in their own government declines as a result.

Carbon Dioxide emissions since 1800. Notice the spike in the 1970's. Even several oil shocks didn't force us to replace old tools for digital ones.

## Things Won't Change, Until

Most of our problems started in the 1970's for a reason. That's when protagonists's created digital tools, and Darth Blockbuster showed up to keep our car driving, suburban living, broadcast television watching, 9-5 working, two car garage home building, unhealthy food eating, central power station buying, univeristy admission test taking lifestyle going. Despite totally new tools, the American way of life hasn't changed. It's still the "American Dream" to live in a post World War II baby boomer suburb.

Our environment is changing, available resources are depleting, and our tools are completely different. Yet we live the same. That's like trying to make a camel live in the Amazon. There's nothing wrong with either, but they simply aren't adapted to each other.

Darth Blockbuster is the camel forcing us to keep his suburban lifestyle "desert" in power to prevent having to compete in the Amazon of digital tools. Done because Darth Blockbuster co-opts society's rule book to keep old tools in power. That's how our society subsidizes a wet and very selfish camel.

Addicted to fighting over the controls to old tool, our politics doesn't notice. For example, because university libraries and lecture halls are still considered "formal education", so red / blue endlessly debate who should get into university and how the masive expense should be paid. Endless battles over affirmative action, student loan rates, and state education subsidies are the result.

All while better tools are ignored. Digital tools can educate anyone willing. Wikipedia, YouTube, Khan Academy, Udemy, Skillshare, Curiosity Stream, Brilliant, The Great Courses, are merely the first new digital education tools. They do wonderful jobs while costing a tiny fraction of formal education and getting no official support. Yet, we don't teach kids to read or update Wikipedia in schools. We don't track student progress in Khan Academy's micro-lessons. We defintely don't recognize "degrees" from Udemy, or YouTube, even though most programmers and designers learn far more there then in any college classroom.

Our society suffers keeping the imagined world baby-boomer suburban desert alive. Despite way too much carbon in the atmostphere, gridlocked roads, housing bubble bursts, massive student debt, and horrible individual health, our politics keeps us using gas cars, mass produced homes with no solar panels or water collection built in, super-expensive college education, and very confusing health insurance. Our entire frickin climate is changing because our ruling philosophy is not.

Middle class quality of life, political cooperation, and climate change, won't get better until the extras join the protagonists, step-up to the antagonists, and start to use digital tools that solve frontline problems. To do that, we need Techvolution. Until then, we're basically camels trying to live in the Amazon.

But don't despair. The good news is, we can win Skywalker. I'll show you.

# A TECHVOLUTION BATTLE SCENE

## Battle Introduction

In the 1970's the transistor, internet, computer monitors, and other digital technology, started to leave labs and research centres and make their way into products. Finally, after centuries of primitive tools, society had ones cheap enough to mass produce, yet powerful enough to change our way of life. Of course, that's when Darth Blockbuster appeared and went to work defending his way of life.

Some examples. In the 1970's AT&T defended the telephone communications by successfully lobbying government to ban Americans from using internet modems. In 1984, the entertainment industry defended broadcast television by suing home video cassette recorders-only losing by one vote in the Supreme Court. In 2001, the music industry defended music compact discs by successfully suing digital songs. Likewise, Tesla, Uber, AirBnB biggest competition has been in the courtroom. Throughout society the antagonists found ways to keep digital tools from the hands of the people.

The antagonists even resisted help. As Napster was introducing digital songs to America, and being sued for it, Steve Jobs wanted to improve digital songs with iTunes. Music executives had already tried and failed horribly to make their own platform. Despite the supposed crisis of Napster, Jobs said he'd "never spent so much of my time trying to convince people [music executives] to do the right thing for themselves".

The problem wasn't Napster. It was Darth Blockbuster. To be fair, he knew how to manage a huge corporation, collect money to get employees paid, and make a product people wanted. Yet he didn't know anything about new technology and so fought back with rules, not tools.

Darth Blockbuster's antagonism to new tools was so strong he resisted change even from Steve Jobs. From Galileo to Washington, Tesla to Jobs, the battle between antagonits, protagoinsts, and extras has always been the same. Let's learn how this story looks in a little more detail.

## How New Tools Start the Fight

In biological evolution there are continual adaptations of existing lifeforms, and then sometimes entirely new lifeforms. In Techvolution this is the difference between a new technology, and a new tool.

Upgrading a technology is an iterative change; like going from Sedan's to SUV's, VHS to DVD's, tube televisons's to LCD's. Each is different technologically, but they do the same job, so no new majic is needed to attract users. As a result no political battles are started.

But when we've upgraded enough technologies, like microchips, touchscreens, batteries, and WiFi, a genius can unlock a new tool like smartphones. And this requires new majic and thus is a big deal.

![New Tool Creation](/img\diagrams\techvolution-new-tool-creation-pc.png)

Why? Well, because creating a new tool asks a climactic and political question: who controls it? After all, whoever does, is more powerful. The weilder of the new tool can let extras majically connect with it to solve their problems. Or withold it and convince the extras to keep using old tools. Like muscle cars trying to keep customers away from Tesla with techniques like mass advertising, car culture, and spectacle filled V8 cars. Techniques I call dark majic.

Thus, while civilization is a struggle to overcome problems by upgrading technology and inventing new tools, it’s also a battle to control them. The people with the old tool fight to retain their power, while inventors and innovators imagine a new society that shares it.

The eternal story of civilization is thus protagonists like Jobs making new tools, antagonists like music company executives attacking new tools, and many extras watching them fight. Our politics is an ongoing history of technological change, with protagonist and antagonist both reaching to control the tool and make themselves the winner.

Today the extras are not self-aware of their power to decide the winner. I’ll show you how important you are. Here’s how you changed the world just by being curious and loving majic.

![Dist-vs-retention](/img\diagrams\techvolution-distribution-vs-rentention-2.png)

## Extras Killed Wikipedia's Evil Twin

The environment keeps changing. Life needs to know how and uses its lifeforms to probe for answers. Similarly, people always have questions like why are movies so expensive, or more importantly how does malaria spread and what are proven techniques to not get infected. Constant questions are a problem and we need a tool to solve it. True to ourselves, we make a reference tool with the technology available and upgrade it when possible.

Our first reference tool was the wisdom of our elders. The first technological upgrades were papyrus scrolls and ink (500 BC) and books (500), which turned some elders into experts like Hippocrates and Aristotle. When wood-pulp paper (1200) and the printing press (1456) were invented, humanity unleashed mass-produced books. Now experts could share knowledge between themselves and educate the masses. We called the reference books encyclopedias.

People loved encyclopedias. They answered many questions. The _Encyclopedia Britannica_ (1878) was the standard. It went into continuous publication (1933) to keep people updated to the latest facts. In the following decades, the computer, digital printer, and telecommunications meant encyclopedias were written and stored digitally. But they remained a set of printed books and CD's controlled by experts.

Then came the world wide web (1991), a new technology that unlocked many new tools like websites, forums, blogs, and something called “wikis”. Wiki software lets anyone write or edit a webpage by pressing “edit now”. All changes are saved, so anyone can erase errors or vandalism by pressing “undo now”. For years programmers used wikis to collaboratively write technical manuals.

As web tools boomed in the late ’90’s, protagonist Jimmy Wales wondered if the web could upgrade encyclopedias. Today, most of us who were curious about things like electromagnetism know our quest ends with a free online encyclopedia anyone can edit called Wikipedia. But it didn’t start out that way.

Wikipedia started as Nupedia (2000). Nupedia was a free online copycat of Encyclopedia Britannica where only “expert” professors made articles. Wikipedia (2001) was a side project. Only programmers knew “community content creation” would work.

Everyone else assumed regular people would only read the work of professors. The first issue with this theory was that the professors didn’t like to share their knowledge. In its first year, Nupedia had 12 articles. Wikipedia had 40,000, which most professors loved to belittle as rubbish. Professors even disallowed students from referencing Wikipedia's articles in their papers. Yet professors refused to improve, or to assign students to improve, Wikipedia.

The second issue was that it turned out “expert” answers and “regular” answers are the same. Mosquitto nets are a simple and effective tool against malaria infections.

Thirdly, Wikipedia was so easy to use many extras became protagonists! A huge community of non-academics voluntarily shared their knowledge one “edit now” at a time and fiercely protected their common knowledge with “undo now”. Nobody told them, paid them, or made a rule to force it. Because performing majic, and expanding someone elses cyborgolgy with things like mosquitto nets, is again its own reward.

And lastly, so many people loved the performance, flocked to Wikipedia's answers. The extra’s mass support quickly made Wikipedia king, while giving Nupedia and Encyclopedia Britannica quick deaths.

That’s the story of Wikipedia. Made by new protagoinsts, made the standard reference tool by extras. Few believed it was possible, because even professors don’t understand new tools always unpower the few, to empower the rest. Interestingly, after I finally conceded temporary defeat to my personal Darth Blockbuster, I uploaded a few pages to Wikipedia instead. Not as helpful as my app, but it took just a few weeks of work, and one “edit now” button, to make it real. It felt majical to bypass the rules.

![Wikipedia development](/img\diagrams\techvolution-enclyclopedia-book-wiki.png)

### You Can Win

Wikipedia's victory is another example of the archetypal Techvolution story. Like Galileo and his telescope, George Washington and his musket, and Steve Jobs and his iTunes. Wikipedia was a victory for protagonists. What makes it especially cool, is digital tools made it quite easy to empower today's extras.

Imagine when digital tools are let free! That’s the story Skywalker I want you to make happen with lightsabers a-blazin’, dicing up old tools like evil storm troopers, to smooth out humanity’s natural evolution. The open-source community are making new tools. But they are facing down Darth Blockbuster on their own. To help them change our world, they need as much help as Wikipedia got.

Note however, our lives cut across thousands to millions of problems. Thus, our villians are not in a massive group like “the rich” or the “the unions” as old philosophies label. Our villians reveal themselves inside thousands of companies, institutions, and organizations, by suppressing new tools to keep their version of the DVD alive.

Together, protagonists and extras can kill all these Darth Blockbusters. I know this because our battle today was fought generations ago with his master, Darth King.

Darth King lived inside palaces, using society’s money to host splendid banquests and balls. His absolute power was hidden inside a ruling philosophy of the “noble’s divine right to rule”. Slowly, as protagonists invented scientific instruments, books, and guns, a new philosophy was born. A philosophy of science, enlightenment, equality, and democracy, made real when the protagonists and extras fought as one in the American and French Revolutions. They were inspired by the new philosophy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

![Battle Scene](/img\diagrams\techvolution-battle.png)

# ROUSSEAU'S EXTRAS

## Freeing Cinderella

“Extras are born free; and everywhere they are in chains.” Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote that in 1762. He was the King of France. No he wasn’t. Was he the richest man in England? Absolutely not. Rousseau was a poor writer who copied sheets of music to make the rent. More than 300 years later, he is recognized as being a great philosopher, a political visionary, and a protagonist who helped free the world with his new philosophy.

Rousseau lived when kings and queens, dukes and duchesses ruled civilization. A time when Mozart played inside exquisite palaces during the nobility’s many banquets and balls. This was the opulence that had Cinderella dreaming her days away as she cleaned a dirty chateau. Sadly, unlike the the fairy tale, the extras didn’t have a fairy Godmother to make their dreams come true. Instead, the commoners cleaned the noble’s vast libraries, used guns while dying in their wars, and were told to ignore what science revealed. The extras were excluded from the power of new tools because they believed their beloved Holy Bible said only Darth King had the “divine right to rule”.

Rousseau called bullshit. In truth, Jesus was a carpenter, a commoner just like any other extra—you could argue—who rose to become the ultimate protagonist. Who is anyone to say that other extras can’t live up to their own potential? Rousseau said books, guns, and scientific instruments should liberate the extras who were only in chains for the happiness of con artists. The self-proclaimed “divine nobility” didn’t like hearing that. This powerful self-protecting community declared Rousseau a banquet-pooper, and chased him out of Switzerland, France, and England. Maybe that’s why Rousseau rented instead of owned.

Starting in 1776, within Rousseau’s lifetime, Darth King started to face the music when the American people started a revolution. One year after he died, the French had their own revolution in 1789. And on it went from country to country because Rousseau, and others like him, make the extras realize they should become protagonists with a ruling philosophy “of the people, for the people, by the people”. Cinderella soon forgot about the fancy ball, and instead song the music of freedom in a choir of equals, that sounded something like this:

  France that Europe admires
  Has regained Liberty
  And every citizen breathes
  Under the laws of Equality,
  One day its beloved image
  Will extend throughout the universe.
  Peoples, you will break your chains
  And you will have a Fatherland!

Revolutionary songs like this spread the people’s liberty, equality, and fraternity throughout the world. In a few years, civilization changed its ruling philosphy from knowing the nobles were divine, to knowing they were villians who resorted to hiring mercenaries rather than realize the people didn't need them anymore.

When the people took control of books, guns, and science, they put presidents and senators, judges and sherriffs in power, who ruled at the request of new protagonists who built a civilization of democracy, equality, and checks and balances, because no one was divine. A change empowered by tools, thought of in philosophy, yet made real with the bloodshed of revolutions on the frontline.

Rousseau died never having found a home. After they won their revolutions, a population of heroes put him to rest inside the glorious Panthéon, heralding him as a renowned breaker of chains, in a free world he helped build. Where any guy can be the prince, and any girl can be Cinderella.

The question for us is, how did Rousseau actually make an entire people change their ruling philosophy, and how can we do it better, because I'd really like to avoid a revolution.

![Revolutions!](/img\diagrams\techvolution-revolution.png)

## ~~Revolution~~ Techvolution

Skywalker, you look disappointed. You think revolutions are fun. You want to follow _Les Miserables_ and march in the street! Maybe we should. You get the bristol boards, I'll get the paint, and we'll change the world! Free college education! Less regulations! Affordable health insurance! Tax cuts! We march and yell and it'll happen.

We'll write it down in regulations, laws, and blog posts and "poof" it'll happen like magic.

And selling fast ending magic is how red / blue survive. Without giving new tools to the people, today's politics is only about fighting, not solving frontline problems. Solar panels, air quality testors, EKG monitors, repairable laptops, safe nuclear reactors, easy to manufacture vaccines, waterless toilets, all improve the real-world. The rest is talk.

Ignore revolutions! Resist the self-gratification of blaming "the other side" for society's problems using primitive tools.

Digital tools are ready and waiting for the people to solve our many frontline problems. We just need Techvolution, the freedom to choose the best tools to solve our problems at home, work, and leisure. Majically bonding with whatever tool we want, is the ultimate revolution.

## Good and Bad Stories

And that's in short what Rousseau said; let the people prosper, and return the nobility to their natural equality inside a democracy. But he was ignored until frontine anger turned into violent revolutions.

We can learn from him and put his lessons into Techvolution's DNA.

Importantly, in addition to being a philosoper, Rousseau was also a novelist. And what he did in his philosophy was tell the different between good and bad stories. Not in literature, but in human societies. Let's take a look ourselves Skywalker, using movies because that's what most people will know.

===

All stories are a sequence of events, where a protagonist fights an antagonist, to overcome a problem. The fight to change reality happens in three parts. The first is an introduction of problem and characters. The second is the back and forth battle between heroes and villians. The third part is the conclusion, where we find out which side wins.

Althought its easier to see in some than others, all stories have this make up. The difference between good and bad stories is something else. It depends how much logic and surprise the writer puts into his story. Good stories mix it up, while bad either has too much of one or the other.

**Classic stories:** are about a real-life problem. Protagonist and antagonist think of new ideas, and act on them in a back and forth battle. New ideas give the stories surprises, while fighting to win requires logical actions.

Both characters keep challenging each other, revealing new sides of themselves. This keeps opening up possibilities for what's going to happen next, and giving the audience many "logical surprises".  Audiences are naturally engaged in the magic of good stortelling. The conclusion can be a big victory for the good or bad guys, or somewhere in between.

There's no way to know which stories will reasonate with audiences, but only these stories can reasonate with audiences and become classics like Cinderella, Romeo and Juliette, The Matrix, Star Wars.

**Art stories:** are not about any specific problem. Art films are more about the protagonist's ideas, not acting to overcome a problem. The result is very surprising idiosyncractic behavior, but storylines with no problem solving to logically tie events together. The result is surprising but pointless stories that can't change reality.

Few people like art stories. The ones who do surround themselves with ever more awards, granduer, titles, and elitist culture that needs to get weirder and weirder to maintain interest. Film festivals like Cannes, Sundance, Toronto mainly show art films.

**Spectacle stories:** are about an obvious problem, ie. Godzilla is here, so run like hell and keep running until the movie is over. Spectacle movies are thus very logical because the problem is very simple; survive or die. Since the action is so instinctual, there's no time for the protagoinst to think of new ideas. The result is very logical but unsuprising stories that can't change reality.

To maintain interest, spectacle movies have to keep ramping up fancy props, special effects, gore, and rauchiness. It doesn't work for too long, so they're usually looking for new customers with mass marketing campaigns. Today most franchise movies, sequels, and remakes are spectacle movies.

![All three stories!](/img\diagrams\techvolution-all-stories.png)

===

In storytelling, logic and surprises counter-balance each other. Withholding one makes art films that are self-important, and withholding the other makes spectacle movies that are  simple. Classic stories are good because they mix the two and create "logical surprises" that open our minds and change things. This is why art/spectacle stories don't have "spoilers", while we want to "go in fresh" for classic stories.

Rousseau noticed society has these three stories. This was important because one works for equality and democracy, and the other two work to enrich the rich and distract the masses.

![Classic heroes](/img\diagrams\techvolution-protagonist-comparison.png)

## Politics of Stories

Politics lives inside these stories. Classic stories are about equality and democracy.

This is because they're based on solving a problem by be controlling a tool. Let's use a different example, _The Matrix_. This story depicts a dystopian future in which most of humanity is unknowingly trapped inside a simulated 1990's reality called the matrix. It's created by machines to distract humans while using their bodies as an energy source. Neo is recruited to help the few untapped humans rebel against the machines. His job is to make the sleeping masses inside the Matrix realize their reality is fake.

The plug into the matrix is the tool that controls the story. Neo must make the people realize they are plugged in. Only they can wake themselves up.

The good guys fight to solve this problem. They choose Neo as their leader and form a hierarchy around him because the matrix is nothing but a rule book the machines write to keep the people asleep. But the good guys know the machines can't see above their ruling philosophy of slavery.

Neo can. He can rise above the matrix's rules, and not only control the matrix, but rewrite the rules!

Neo does it, defeats the machines by control the storry's pivotal tool. And once the problem is solved, Neo returns to being equal members of the community. His hierarchy of support was temporary, being based on solving a frontline problem.

Perhaps he'll be the hero of the next story, but maybe not. It depends on the problem, and who the people decide who will best solve it and be their hero. After every classic story ends, the heirarchy returns everyone to equality.

Spectacle and art stories do not solve frontline problems. Thus, their heirarchies can go on for as long as they can convince people to watch them, or live inside them. Just like the people stuck inside the matrix are watching spectacle. A fake world full of shiny cars, loud music, and 9-5 work days.

The real world sucks, and Neo has to convince the people living in the sucky reality is better than the pleasant fiction. Meanwhile the machines are living an art story of being elites, whose hierachies can go on forever because they're using amazing spectacle to distract the masses.

Of course this story is a exactly the same as Frederick Douglass, Mister Auld, and Sophia. Auld being the antagonist to freedom, Douglass the protagoinst responsible for waking himself, and everyone else up. And Sophia is the masses, who follow the rules even when it causes themselve harm.

Douglass is Neo! And so was Rousseau. He woke people up to the reality. That spectacle and art is bullshit, while heroes who solve problems return to being equal once the job is done. And that's our problem. We can't simply say anyone who heads a heirarchy is bad, because they may be a legitimate hero. How do we know when they aren't? When the extras decide to wake up and realize their frontline problems.

People didn't listen to Rousseau before the extras rose up in revolutions. Like reminding ourself of good news, it's important to note that real heroes do exist. Even the ancestors of Darth King were heroes. Here's a quick history to explain why.

![Classic heroes](/img\diagrams\techvolution-battle-douglass.png)

## Protagonist Kings

In Rousseau's time "holy" noble families ruled every European country. But they were in power because of their ancestors. After western Rome fell in 476 western Europe entered the Dark Ages (500-1000). So called because there was no books, ink, or literate people to write anything down. Nor was there much else, like sanitation, military, judicial systems. Civilization was gone. Anarchy ruled. The Dark Ages sucked.

People like Clovis I, Charles Martel, and Alfred the Great took charge. They were master warriors who uses swords, bows, armour, and calvary to fight off invaders. Even better, they headed large families who kept some peace. They built castles to protect the newly remade wells, hospitals, and markets.

This was a classic story. A hero saw a real-life problem, was determined to change it, rallied supporters, and took on the evil villians. All stories have this heirarchy because the protagonist is in charge and their success at grabbing hold of the all-powerful tools, determines if society improves or not.

Fittingly, a hierarchy formed around society's use of these primitive tools. We call it feuldalism. You've probably seen it in Robin Hood, Monty Python, or Game of Thrones. Feuldalism was a rigid heirarchy of kings, bishops, dukes, sherrifs, knights, priests, tradesman, and peasants. In return for loyalty, the people got was called the "King's peace", which slowly let the people update their cyborgolgy with shovels, oxen, thatched houses, buckets, sickels, and more.

The people happily declared the leaders holy, for they experienced the holiness with ever warmer beds and fuller stomachs. And until their society had politcal institutions like dependable judicial systems and government, the personal rule of the nobilty was a needed stand in. Kind of like a mafia.

The people were an audience who watched fiction become reality; believing in divinty was the logical reaction, like laughter is to comedy. However, the story took generations to finish. By the Renaissance nobody could remember why it started.

As Europe went through the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the invaders were increasingly gone, the water was running, the roads were clean, the markets were busy. Europe had vastly better tools of a vastly better civilization. The only thing that didn't change was the rules.

## Antagonist Kings

The nobles were no longer military leaders fighting off Vandals, Vikings, and brigands, but simply born with "noble blood". They only waged war against each other, and usually only for personal glory. But otherwise they sat atop a hierachy who paid no taxes, did no work, and answered to no one. The nobles used relative peace and prosperity to replace armour with dresses, castles with palaces, and battlefields with banquets and balls.

Loving life, and without opposition, these nobles conned the people, and themselves, with art and spectacle. They lived inside an art culture, where ever more self-importance, eccentricity, gossip, and titles, was the norm. And they distracted the people with spectacle to watch. Brilliant cathedrals, palaces, and wars against other kingdoms to keep the masses occupied. Like franchise movies, these got more intense to keep the story interesting.

Visit European classic castles and extravadent palaces, modest churches and brilliant cathedrals, and you'll see the transformation from function to spectacle in Europe's buildings. Compare the clothes of armoured clad Charles Martel, and the dress wearing Louis XIV, and you'll see the transformation from function to art.

Frontline problems piled up. The people's situation barely changed, and arguably got worse, from 1000 to 1778. Their houses were still thatched. Their still used hand tools. They still paid the vast majority of the society's taxes. They were still banned from advancing in official society. Feuldalism became a caste system controlled by con artists who are rightfully called Darth King for fought against natural equality and distributing the power of new tools to the people.

Darth King used art to tell themselves the the rules were sent from God, and should thus never end. The practical reason for noble divinity, fighting off anarchy, was ignored. The nobles lost the plot of their own stories. They held their people back from learning and adopting new tools. It sent Darth King's civilizations into revolutions, and cost him his head.

## Our Story

ALl this applies to us too. It's important to note, while Rousseau's followers may have been political free, they were economically poor. Hunger, disease, unemployment, illiteracy, were all rampant. The time was basically "economic anarchy".

Like how society loved the original kings for winning the "King's peace", the original economic kings were heroes for winning massive economic growth. They said follow me, recognize my property rights, let me run the economy, my company's will keep you employed and improve your life with new tools like lightbulbs, stoves, and toaster ovens.

Slowly but surely, they did. They told a good story during the Industrial Revolutions. The people were again an audience who watched fiction become reality as we overcame economic anarchy. And we did that with many of the primitive tools of today. Schools, colleges, and universities educated the masses. Gas trucks and cars moved resources and products much faster. Oil and coal powered everything.

Darth Blockbuster's forebears like Andrew Stanton, Andrew Carnegie, Cornelius Vanderbilt, did what Clovis I and the rest did. And like how Darth King was only exposed when new tools empowered the extras so they didn't need to be peasants anymore, Darth Blockbuster was only revealed when digital tools were so powerful, the extras didn't need to be 9-5 working, consumers anymore.

To defend his today's primitive tools, he surrounds himself with story of self-importance, and distracts the people with spectacle. John Wayne noticed this started, not suprisingly, in the 1970's for movies:

>Now the goddamned stock manipulators have taken over. They don't know a goddamned thing about making movies. They make something dirty, and it makes money, and they say, 'Jesus, let's make one a little dirtier, maybe it'll make more money.' And now even the bankers are getting their noses into it.

This same thing happened through suburnan "American Dream". Detached homes got ever more spectular, bigger sizes, designer fashion. Cars got bigger, more size, more chrome, more horsepower. Televisions increase in size. All these were used to promote a "Desperate Housewives" suburban lifestyle of drinking win, holding house parties, and being a office worker who didn't do manual labour but talked alot of saving the world via red / blue politics.

And, if we're going to change that, we need to realize all bad stories eventually end badly, so.... shit something is wrong...

# THE BIG FIGHT

## Obi Wan In Trouble

Midway through _Star Wars_, the ship taking Skywalker, Obi-Wan, Leia, and the rest is captured by the Death Star; the very ship the secret plans were stolen to destroy. It's great writing, because the heroes have to escape it, so they can destroy it.

Well I hope you took notes Skywalker. Because they got me! The antagonists have me in a Darth Blockbuster choke hold. And I'm in trouble.

See, I broke the rules. Darth Blockbuster shot his Death Star, sent stormtroopers, and I was over powered. Not by superior reasoning, philosophy, or ethics. No, they over powered me because some extras joined them!

I'm here, like Rapunzel, trapped in the Death Star, under the watch of extras. You have to the secret plans to the rule book. And now have to find its weakness, in order to free me. I'm being well treated other than being forced to listen to red / blue cable news. Can you convince the extras I'm a good guy? Can you save me?

Oh what did I do? I downloaded a movie from the pirate bay.

Hurry up! Cable news is showing protestors are flying to protest climate change. I don't know how much longer I got, nevermind the polar bears. Help!

### Skywalker Turns on His Lightsaber

Fucking Obi-Wan. How'd he get caught? Caught, I didn't even know they were chasing us. Shit's getting serious. Or shit always is. He'd saying something like that.

So he broke the rules, and the extras agreed, and now he's trapped, and I have to get him out.

Or better put, he watched a digital movie, which broke their rules, and some of the extras agreed. The first step is intelligence. Let's go on YouTube and see what we can find on Darth Blockbuster.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r1mLa9Gk4Ow" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

An official reporter, talking to offical executives and artists about their problem they say is hurting society. These extras agreed, and turned on Obi-Wan. Well many extras were downloading too, but despite that, it was against the rules. Okay, so we got the basics. Lets use Techvolution, to expand the rebellion of the mind.

### Technological History of the Movies

It's funny how easy it was to find Darth Blockbuster on YouTube. Now, I need to know how movies and television technologically evolved. This would take weeks at a library. But I have Wikipedia so it'll take a few hours. Rubbish indeed professors.

So let's free Obi-Wan.

The first thing to understand, is movies didn't invent stories. We've always, and always will, tell stories. They help us understand our lives and societies. Religious sermons, epic poetry, and stage plays have filled our need of stories throughout the years.

The movies, and later television, are merely tools that help tell stories. Each is a creation of three pieces of technology. Data transmission, data storage, and data viewing. Movies started in 1894 when Thomas Edison's laboratory invented the kinetoscope; the first machine that moved pictures through a light source fast enough to give the impression of seamless movement. Hence the name "moving pictures", simplified as "movies".

The kinetoscope was like a vending machine for movies. Customers looked through a peep hole to see clips of boxing matches or dance routines. It was a popular noveltly, kinda like GIFs on Instagram. Edison owned the patents and created the New Jersey based Motion Picture Patent Corporation (MPPC) to make sure everyone in the young movie industry paid their dues.

After a few years of MPPC's interference and legal threats, in what amounted to shakedowns, movie companies moved to Los Angeles to get away. As new projector technology came, MPPC lost its patent monopoly anyway. The movie industry was free to grow in LA's good weather, cheap land, and no stiffling East Coast corporate hierarchies.

And best yet technology kept improving. New projectors could show movies on huge screens. Although reels weren't long enough yet to show long movies. With the new projectors, movie theaters called Nickelodeons (because admission cost a nickel) opened up across the country. The movies were still novelties, showing exotic animals, news reels, or sports highlights, but getting better, like Instagram stories, instead of GIFs.

By the 1920's film reels were long enough to show three act stories. Although sound still wasn't synched with film, so movies had subtitled dialogue and theatres used live music bands to communicate emotions.

In 1927 film was finally synchronized with sound, giving movies dialogue and music. For the first time in history, full stories were not limited to a physical theatre. Any movie theatre in the world could show any story. A new storytelling tool was thus created.

Like Instagram or Netflix popularity today, the people certainly felt the magic of good storytelling, and the majic of needing the theatre. No longer a novelty, the movies attracted millions every week. American industry rushed to control the booming industry. American culture was told on the silver screen. Leading actors became cultural icons. The industry exploded with profits. Although the people controlled none of it, their interest and loyalty made it happen one movie ticket at a time

Of course, all the technology that made the movie industry so rich and powerful was physical. Data storage, transport, and viewing was physical film, light projectors, and delivery trucks.

This didn't change until a new tool was born in 1948. Televisions used a different mixture of technologies. Huge magnetic tape reels stored content. Radio transmitted content over the airwaves. And televisions recieved the transmissions, and displayed the content on tube televisions.

Broadcasts television companies like NBC, ABC, and CBS, now competed with movie theatres. TV story quality wasn't as good, but the convenience was huge; especially as Americans slowly moved away from the cities packed with movie theatres into the suburbs packed with TV's.

From the 1950's to the early 1980's nothing much changed in the entertainment industry. Movies and television got better technologies. Film reels got clearer, color, and widescreen. Likewise, televisions got bigger and bandwidth improved with cable. But no new tools were created. The people still couldn't choose or produce their own content.

Then came new tools. The magentic tapes databases that stored TV broadcasters content, got small enough to make home video cassette recorder (VCR). VCR's cut out the broadcaster, who of course sued the manufacturer Sony for letting people break the rules and "time shift" television shows. The case ended up in the Supreme Court in 1984.

In a 5-4 vote the power to record and watch videos was distributed to the people; the extras were free to add the VCR to their cyborgology. VCRs, home cameras, and renting movies became very popular in the late 1980's. The most successful video rental company took the name "Blockbuster", the common term for popular movies. The entertainment industry quickly forgot about its VCR objections, and gladly put its content on Blockbuster's busy shelves.

Home entertainment tools kept getting better. In the late 1990's came DVD's and flatscreen televisions. DVD's were more advanced CD's, and worked similar to videotapes, except they were digital. Meaning data was stored as "1 or 0". Plasma or LCD flatscreens televisions were much bigger then tube televisions, and since they were digital too, they were High Definition.

Even more people rushed to upgrade their cyborgology with DVD's and home theatres. Blockbuster rental stores were even busier, especially as people started buying hundreds of DVD's for home libraries. The entertainment industry loved it. They didn't even care movie theatre attendence dropped heavily and many went banktrupt. In fact, they started to use theatres as marketing hype. The money was in DVD sales.

Yet they didn't notice, that the data transmission, data storage, and data viewing technologies of the movie industry was now almost entirely digital.

Except movie distribution. People still had to drive to pick up their DVD's or visit a movie theatre. Hence, people still needed to concentrate around movie theatres, rental stores, or TV guides (i.e. the castles with gatekeepers), to acccess their digital data.

Until they didn't.

The internet, the transfer of digital information that was used for email and webpages since the 1970's, had kept getting better and faster. And in the early 2000's the internet got High Speed, and could finally transfer 1's and 0's of a DVD faster then someone driving to pick one up.

And here enters The Pirate Bay (2003). Like Napster, it introduced digital movies to people first. Altough the entertainment industry used digital camera's, film projectors, email, webpages, YouTube for years, they didn't want people using a new tool, but to keep using their profitable DVD technology; they even made two new ones called Blu-Ray (2006) and HD-DVD (2006).

The people wanted the better tool. Pirate Bay was the first to offer it. It was a pain, it was hard to learn, but it was better than driving.

Pirates you might say! People are evil, people are cheap, people are thieves! Really? Then explain the graph below, the one what shows how the evil people responded with protagonist Reed Hastings made a new internet tool and gave internet movies to the people. What we call Netflix.

If middle class Americans, Canadians are pirates, why didn't Blockbuster stores have steal bars? The same reason why we don't steal Netflix. Blockbuster was a fair deal, until data streaming movies was possible. Then Netflix was.

The people elected to download movies from pirate bay because it was a upgrade available to their cyborgology. The only natural rule is natural selection. The people choose the best tool because with majic, they evole into better cyborgs. It's not the people's job to wait for an industry to catch up to nature. But the other way around.

Maybe the industry would have noticed that. But they surrounded themselves with art and wanted people to being distracted with spectacle (Blu-Ray, HD-DVD). While calling their own customer's thieves, the movie industrt held countless banquets and balls on the people's DVD dollars; movie premieres, talk shows, award shows, and launch parties. The Oscars, Correspondence Dinners, Emmy's, Golden Globes, Cannes Film Festival, Sundance Film Festival, Toronto International Film Festival, and so many others. All modern version of banquets and balls, with gates to keep you out, and rules put in place to make the good times of the DVD going. Party loving, profit loving, foresight lacking is a recipe for antagonism, hence Darth Blockbuster rose up.

While the spectacle of Blu-Ray and HD-DVD tricked some people. Like with Wikipedia, the vast majority followed the natural majic of online movie streaming instead, even when it was against the rules to improve society.

Digital tools empowered the extras to fight back, and check his self-important art story. Techvolution tells them its right to do it. As for it being against the rules, it was, and maybe it should be, I was naive back then and only ever downloaded a few movies. I was the smuck buying DVD's. Hey, do you think Darth Blockbuster will buy back all those DVDs, Blu-Rays, and HD-DVDs he told me, and us, was better then downloading? I'll take half-price.

### Decision Time

Well extras, stormtroopers, that's your master. He's a Sith Lord. While he may be a great person, nice to you and his employees, wears nice clothing, tips well, whoever he is doesn't matter. He is an antagonist to society. He fought against video tapes, interet songs, and internet streaming. If society was up to Darth Blockbuster, we'd all be paying for long distance, writing directions on napkins, waving down cabs, paying for late charges, and putting quarters into pay phones.

What's going to happen when 3D printing threatens his merchandising. Or when Virtual Reality let's people live their own stories. Or whatever! We shouldn't have to argue for new tools!

But since the 1970's our society, our politics, has been falling apart because of Darth Blockbuster. We try to fix things with red / blue politics, but they don't undertand real politics is the control of new tools.

So we the people work two jobs to pay the bills. Why our climate is changing. Why our roads are traffic jammed. Because we as digital tools are invented, the Sith keep writing laws, regulations, and fighting lawsuits to try and made us live like it's 1970 forever.

Let Obi-Wan go!

# A SURE VICTORY

Can't make up your mind. This will help. The force is strong with whoever holds digital tools. And that by design. The thousands of protagonists who built digital tools wanted to empower individual people like you.

For the interent, they built individual empowerment from the start. And this fact means Darth Blockbuster never did, and never will, stand a chance against today's internet Jedi.

## Jedi Paul Baran

The internet has many protagonists. Paul Baran is one of the big ones. Here's why.

The internet is a network. There are many ways of sending data through a network. The simplest is how phone systems do it with a direct circuit link between two phones. A call's connection only stops when someone hangs up.

Alexander Graham Bell invented "direct circuit links" in 1876 and put it into action when he co-founded the American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T) in 1885. For generations direct links was how all telecommunications worked. But when the Soviets tested a hydrogen bomb in 1955, Paul Baran took it upon himself to make a new tool to help prevent a nuclear holocaust.

Baran realized to prevent nuclear war, the world needed a communications network that would survive an atomic attack. Only robust and reliable communications would ease American and Soviet trigger fingers during tense times.

Baran worked alone after work. By 1960 he came up with the two ideas he needed. The first was that his network should have no hubs or organizations (like telephone's have) to control the flow of information. Central hubs make systems vulerable to attack or failure. Instead data flow should be completely distributed so every node can send and receive information equally. Baran's nodes network looks like a fishnet. When wach node has three or four links, the network can survive any attack.

Next Baran had to figure out how to send information across the network. This led to his second idea, which was to break up the data into standard-size little packets. Each message would be broken into many packets, each of which would scurry along different paths through the network’s nodes and be reassembled when they got to their destination. If one packet didn't get there in time, it was quickly resent. This way there'd be no "dropped calls" and communication would always stay open. Baran published his ideas into very detailed technical specs and made sure everyone, especially the Soviets, could copy his work.

Baran then walked into a nest of villians in America. When Baran's employer RAND recommended his "node-packet data network" idea to the Air Force (in control of America's nuclear missles) they wanted to build it. But when the Department of Defense got itself and the Defense Communications Agency involved Baran soon found out working with so many bureaucrats was hopeless.

So Baran tried to convince AT&T, in control of America's telephone network, to supplement their system with his node-packet data network. “They fought it tooth and nail,” he recalled. “They tried all sorts of things to stop it.” They would not even let RAND use the maps of its circuits, so Baran had to use a pirated set. He made several trips to AT&T headquarters in lower Manhattan. On one of them, a senior executive who was an old engineer looked stunned when Baran explained that his system would mean that data could go back and forth without a dedicated link remaining open. “He looked at his colleagues in the room while his eyeballs rolled up sending a signal of his utter disbelief,” according to Baran. After a pause, the executive said, “Son, here’s how a telephone works,” and explained a patronizing and simplistic description.

The metaphorical Death Star rule book became real! It was actually against the rules to make a reliable communication network that might help prevent a nuclear holocaust. Good thing Jedi's don't give up. Baran continued to push. AT&T finally had him and other outsiders to a series of seminars explaining how its telephone system really worked. “It took ninety-four separate speakers to describe the entire system,” Baran marveled. When it was over, the AT&T executives asked Baran, “Now do you see why packet switching wouldn’t work?” To their great disappointment, Baran simply replied, “No.”

To heck with Darth Telephone!

A decade later Baran's network was built when the US government's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) saw the wisdom in a node-packet distrbuted communications network. In 1969 ARPA used Baran's technical specs to build ARPAnet, the first version of the internet. The people who actually made it were hellbent on empowering individuals, and the made sure the internet could not be controlled by any government or corporation.

Baran's network is why our smartphones, websites, Wikipedia, any digital tool connected to the internet empower individuals. In the DNA of the interent is a distributed node network that nobody can control or shutdown. An individual has the exact same access as any corporation or government.

That's why the internet is majical. Whoever uses it, is automatically empowered. It's why Darth Blockbuster was never on the right side of history. So let Obi-Wan go!

_Paul Baran's story was adapted from Walter Isaacson's awesome book_ The Innovators, _Chapter 7._
  
# DARTH KING CHARLES

Although I like to think this has all been pretty convincing. I really like Obi-Wan, so I'm going to mention how antagonists may be well intentioned, but they'll never change their mind. Indeed, the problems we're having in our world with no majic has happened before. Let's go back the ruling philosophy of the nobles divine right, see how it all worked out for Darth King Charles.

## Place in Line

When Rousseau was being chased around Europe in the 1760-70's, King Louis XVI rule France and King George III ruled England. Both faced revolutions inspired by the pain on the frontline their high-spending lifestyles and government mismanagement caused. However, these weren't the first kings to face revolts.

Before Rousseau explained frontline problems to the people, the people still rose up against noble's excesses and incompetent leadership. Among the first to face the people's wrath was King Charles I, who ruled England from 1625-1649.

Charles ruled as an absolute monarch under the "nobles right to rule" ruling philosophy. England had a Parliament but it was supposed to advise the king and not tell him what to do. After some revolts in the Middle Ages, parliament did however earn the power to approve taxes.

After years of his forebears mismanaging government finances, and overspending himself, Charles needed money. The people and their parliament refused to say yes until they got more political powers. Charles refused to talk. Instead he sent parliament home, and ruled by himself for 10 years. He raised taxes using some very old feudal rules. One retroactively fined some men for not showing up to Charles' coronation 10 years earlier. Charle's version of the fine print didn't endear him to the people.

Parliament eventually got sick of this subversion, raised an army, and fought the English Civil War (1642–1646). The army was local men devoted to their parliament. It's officers were chosen by merit, while Charles's men were mostly nobles who hired mercenaries to fight for them. The war between "parliamentarians" and "loyalists" was bad. It inspired the saying that life without a working government is "nasty, brutish, and short".

After four years Charles lost. He was held under arrest, while rules for a "constituional monarchy" were being made by the Parliamentarians. But then Charles escaped, hired a new army, and fought the Second English Civil War (1648–1649).

Charles lost again. The victorious Parlimentarians were enraged. They forgot about a constitutional monarch, and charged Charles for crimes against the English people. While they didn't have a new ruling philosophy, the people were at least questioning the one in power.

Charles didn't budge. The rules were on his side. The Bible said he was God's representative on Earth. He was the natural leader the same way a father is the leader of his children. In fact, despite being tried for high-crimes, Charles refused to speak to the court; a father doesn't answer to his children.

But then Darth King Charles did speak, and that fact, showcases how set the Sith are in their stories.

### Charles Speaks

Charles had a speech impediment. Often called a stammer or studder. No one then, or even now, understands what causes it. It's annoying to listen to. Like music coming from a damaged stereo speaker.

That's because for a stutterer, talking is like playing guitar with music notes written on the fly by a gremlin. Some words are easy to say, some are ~~difficult~~ hard, and some decide which at the last mili-mili-mili-second. The stutterer has to jump around the words in real time. Fail and you miss a --- beat.

But a stutter isn't just pauses. Stuttering is like getting hit with a stun gun and having a mini-seizure. You're body seizes. Your neck tenses. You stop breathing. It's horrible.

The physical pain isn't even the worst. Getting _that_ look from people is. The "what the fuck is wrong with you?" look.

Hello, my ~~name~~ I go by John-ne. I wa-want ~~can~~ want to help ~~master~~ human evol-ution. I've been ~~writ~~ trying to write this book for ~~about~~ ah ~~five~~...

The prospect of talking, except to yourself and a dog, which Charles had two of, causes huge anxiety. The idea of never conversing with anyone causes huge loneliness and depression. _The King's Speech_ showed it well. Stuttering usually forces a person to be shy, passive, eager to please, and come up with weired reasons for their erratic speaking like hand gestures, random silence, binge drinking, and swear words (which like being alone or dogs, for some reason never cause a stutter). It's entirely possible Charles' relationship with Parliament was so bad because he simply didn't want to talk with them. Not that he would ever admit he had a impediment. After all, he was a king!

I know this all because luckily enough (kidding) I have the same affliction as Charles. It was the reason I got a job in a car insurance claim department. After a vice president at an old company secretly told my supervisor I wasn't allowed to talk to customers, for fear of embarrasing the company, I was like shit I guess I don't have this damn gremlin under control. I wasn't even that mad about it (although I was that it was an open secret for over a year). I never told anyone I had the impediment, so despite therapy as a kid, it was obviously still a problem.

So fuck it. I decided to jump in the ocean and sink or swim. A car insurance claim call-centre is like climbing swimming the open ocean for a stutterer. A daily workout of all day phone calls, angry drivers, customer service expectations, no "outs" like swear words, booze, or wonky behavior to hide behind.

And it was far worse then I thought. The insurance company wanted adjusters to answer ever more phone calls. To incentize us, they'd ring a monotone "bell" because... I don't know. They never said why, we employees learned questioning "the bell" was a bad idea. Management used it as punishment; "answer more phone calls or we'll make the bell faster and louder!".

I'm being serious by the way. We were often more stressed then the person who just had a car crash. Whatever the reason, DING-DING-DING-DING almost all day, which gave people who weren't stutterers huge anxiety, breakdowns, and stress leaves.

Super-shock speech therapy! After about a year I didn't have to massage my jaws at night to release it from all the teeth shattering jaw-clenches I did to divert vocal stuttering. I was cured!

The point is this. That's what it took for me to mostly, except when pretenious cultures limit my word choices, never stutter. It's like night and day. The anxiety washed away. A hidden outgoing personality was brought out and frankly is fun, although still surreal, to be.

Yet Charles never had this lesson. Despite being adament he was God's chosen leader (or perhaps because of it), he was famoulsy shy and quiet his whole life because the gremlin likes it that way. Even when fighting for 16 years defending his ruling philosophy, Charles still probably had to massage his strained jaws every night. I can sympathize. The gremlin is an asshole.

At Charles trial, he was accused of being "a Tyrant, A Traitor, Murderer, and a public enemy to the Commonwealth of England". Not a bad king, but a bad ruler. The people of England, empowered with many books, scientific instruments, and especially guns of a healthy civilization, were replacing their leader. A novel ideal at the time.

The prosecutors didn't have Rousseau's new ruling philosophy to replace the "divine rights of nobles". They simply said Charles was a tyrant and asked for the death penalty. Charles wouldn't even acknowledge the trial. He didn't believe his life was on the chopping block. Kings don't answer to children.

Charles wasn't pretending or bluffing. He wasn't proud, or stubborn. He psychologically couldn't understand even the idea of being wrong. Like Mr. Auld, he lived in a different story with a different ruling philosophy. One that made him the protagonist.

The judges convicted Charles anyway. He was sentenced to death by removing the head from the body. Charles was flabbergasted. He finally spoke at the execution. Fuck the ringing bell of a claims department, Charles only had words to justify himself to his (supposed) subjects and to history. And... and... no stutter. Not once!

Charles freely, openely, spoke the music of his mind.

He didn't just speak, he spoke so eloquently many people, even those who hated him, were impressed. He spoke so well, so clearly, the people heard him speak! Fuck... I'm happy for him. It must have felt like God killed the gremlin. What vindication! Indeed Charles's last words were a clearly spoken:

> Truly I desire their (the people’s) liberty and freedom as much as anybody whomsoever; but I must tell you their liberty and freedom consist in having of government, those laws by which their life and their goods may be most their own. It is not for having a share in government, Sir, that is nothing pertaining to them. A subject and a ruler are clear different things...therefore I tell you that I am the Martyr of the people. I die a Christian according to the profession of the Church of England, as I found it left me by my father... I have a good Cause and I have a gracious God. I will say no more.

Clealr spoken words about being totally behind the times. Kings were no longer needed. The people could rule themselves. Charles should have been happy his children grew up. He could have helped them grow up by conceding powers to Parliament and avoiding 16 years of war. Instead he live in splendour, hide behind spectacle, used the people's money to hire foreigners to kill them.

Later kings still didn't learn. Even more distanced from the frontline inside their palaces, banquets and balls, their heads filled with different gremlins that said the rules are just, good, and will never end. France, Spain, Russia had country wide banktrupcies, food shortages, and revolutions, and it didn't matter. The ultimate gremlin is isolation from the frontline. Many more Darth Kings faced the chopping block with the voice of God calling them martyrs.

So why did you think Darth Blockbuster would ever let Obi-Wan go?

# OBI-WAN FIGHTS

The battle scene. I Obi-Wan face Darth Blockbuster. He stares back with hate. I'm still bound. He could strike me down. Instead he lifts his finger, and my cuffs release.

My lightsabre is on a table. I grab it. Turn it on. He does too. The light of both hum together, a nice tune that foretells violence.

He didn't he strike me down because he wants to prove something. Skywalker and I were making good points. Darth Blockbuster needs people to follow his rules, and no better way than for them to see him the hero, and his rules as just. Hero's don't murder, they avenge wrong doing. I must die in open combat inside a court of the rules.

So I fight the Sith lord. We jump up and down. Slice left and right. Slash, kick, punch; we're beating each other bloody. Nothing divides our powers. Neither is reaching for salvation. We both have the same tools. And that's been the problem all along Skywalker.

I mentioned this several times. This battle between protagonists and antagonists is ages old. It was fought when we invented swords, bows and arrows, the printing press, muskets, telescopes, rifles, microscopes, anti-virals, the internet... Like clockwork, whenever we create a new tool, the Sith fight to retain power, the Jedi fight to distribute it. When the former wins, the people's cyborgology stays the same. If the latter wins, the people upgrade their powers to solve frontline problems better.

Galileo, John Locke, Oliver Cromwell, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, George Washington, Frederick Douglas and so many other great people and armies have fought the Sith. Yet the Sith keep coming back. It's too easy for them to take control of society's rule book and but the extra's back in the matrix of bad stories and bad rules.

The Sith's frequent victories mean the line between old and imagined new societies gets wide. We follow the Sith's rules out of fear of his Death Star. Yet evolution still keeps us adapting. Which means we keep fighitng the same fight. To distribute the power of new tools. No matter how hard it's going to be.

PICTURE

## LIFE STAR OVER EGGSHELLS

When someone has their own version of reality, we call it a mental illness. Dealing with this person is said to be like "walking on eggshells", because it's very hard to socialize with their unique version of right and wrong. The lesson is when Techvolution is held back, and society gets more out of whack, the Sith and Jedi are walking on egg shells with each other. Compromise is impossible.

Techvolution only works when everyone, like in Nature, seemingless drops bad tools for new better ones.

Thus, it was never my goal to defeat _this_ Death Star or _this_ Sith Lord. For as long as our civilization uses a human created rule book, killing one king, only lets another take his place.

To truly win, we must create a better tool that replaces the Death Star. One that continually enforces our natural evolution. Where the only rule is natural selection.

That's what I wanted to teach you Skywalker. To use the battles of good and evil in history, to understand Techvolution, to not only make it a ruling philosophy, but to make a tool that will keep it in power and forever kill the Sith.

And now I look at you and see not the kid asking about the rebellion of the mind, but the kid who will forever win the rebellion against the Death Star with our very own tool. The opposite of the Death Star. An uncorruptable rule book, governed by Nature and Techvolution. The Life Star.

You can build it. I can't. It can't be made by old heroes, but only the extras, and the freedom and demand to majically connect with any tool they want. It's the ultimate revolution.

So I lift my sword, and smile. I smile at eternal rest. Because the Jedi will no longer face down the Sith. It's the extras job now, so make a tool that will forever kill them.

So I raise my sword, and Darth Blockbuster, the ignorance protagonist of a dead ruling philosophy, strikes me down.I did happy. Because you know the lesson. The person who holds the tools wins. Build the Life Star and you'll never face a Sith Lord again.
