# TECHVOLUTION: A NEW PHILOSOPHY

# PROLOGUE

## Dedication

For the people in the open-source community. For the unspoken philosophy you handed down to me. For caring so unconditionally when updating Wikipedia, writing free software, and building cool new tech for us all. For showing me who the protagonists are. It’s the best education a political guy can get. I hope I learned enough.

For the antagonists, the self-entitled delegators keeping Blockbuster alive, thanks for causing history to repeat itself yet again. I hope you learn something.

To the extras. When it’s time for you to act, I pray you pick the right side.

## The Beginning

It all started with a door in the face. I few more actually. I'm either too stubborn or too hopeful. Either way, I eventually learned my lesson. I was selling a product upper management were never going to buy.

Before you wonder, it wasn't the price, there was no price. It wasn't the competition. None of that either. And I can promise it worked, because I had done the frontline job it worked for.

I figured out how to solve a problem—and save 100 million dollars, 300,000 hours of productivity, and even several lives—with an app that was virtually free. All I wanted was to give it away. After years of working on political and economic theory, I’ve written (another) book about the untapped possibilities of new tech like apps, bio-monitors, and bitcoin. I wanted real-world proof, and maybe get some real-world credentials, to help validate my ideas.

But I was a fool. I wasn’t even knocking on doors. I was knocking on gates. See, I wasn’t talking to the frontline workers suffering through the problem I solved, but the bureaucrats, lawyers, managers, and executives, who were paid to “deal” with those problems. Solving their problems was asking them to fire themselves. The gates were in place to shut out innovation.

In fact, they never said _no_ to me. _No_ needs a reason. Instead, they said it was against the rules to say yes. Obscure rules, hidden inside regulations and contracts. They believed in these rules, especially the one against letting frontline workers to decide for themselves.

I'm not going to talk about my experience too much. All that's important is there was a problem, a big one wasting millions of your dollars, weeks of workers time (lots of it unpaid overtime), and maybe even your life, and it was against the rules to solve it.

## The Power Of Stories

Do you love stories? I think it’s a safe bet to say that you do. Who doesn’t? They entertain us after a hard day of work, bring us together to share our joys, and (my favorite) open our minds to the different rules and philosophies of foreign cities, mythical worlds, and galaxies far far away.

Stories are so powerful because they’re so simple. Protagonists are good because they want to fix a problem. Antagonists are bad because they don’t. Stories aren’t debates. We take the protagonist’s side. Thus, Romeo and Juliet’s love is beautiful and worth dying for, while their families’ feud is ignorant and stupid. Luke Skywalker’s rebellion is good and worth fighting for, while Darth Vader’s empire is wicked and should be destroyed.

Our moral clarity about a problem turns the protagonists into our heroes and the antagonists into our villians. We thus follow their story with strong emotions, which burst out at the climax, where we find out who wins.

Our hero fights hard to defeat the story’s problem, but his superior morality, justice, and heroism isn’t enough. He’s often too weak or unskilled, and the villian beats him bloody. On the verge of failure, the hero needs to find something, something that’ll turn the tide. He searches, sees, and reaches for his salvation: a tool or a weapon—whether it’s a gun, magic book, or lightsaber.

Will our hero reach it first, or will the enemy? We in the audience, like extras in the story, hold our breath because the story’s society is controlled not by desires, opinions, or rules, but by which character holds the tools. The wielder is the victor. The victor writes the rules. It’s a lesson we need to learn for ourselves.

## A New Empowering Philosophy Called Techvolution

The rules. We think they control us. They don’t. And I’ll show you why.

Talk to any political junkie, no matter when, and they’ll say there’s a big election coming up. They’ll say something like “if the red team wins this one, then education, healthcare, infrastructure, and everything else will go to shit.” What he means is elections decide the rule makers, and that blue rules are good while red rules are evil.

If you buy it—and most of us have at some point—you watch blue cable news, read blue blogs, listen to blue talk radio. You fill your head with blue’s philosophy. Soon enough, your face is painted blue, you’re waving a blue bristol board while yelling blue chants at rallies, marches, and protests. You feel like a hero! You’re fighting against the evil red philosophy!

Let me ask you, if you’re a regular middle-class person, and you ignored the election, how much would you bet, that you would know who won, just by living your life.

I mean today, when team blue wins, does traffic suddenly disappear? When team red wins, does everyone suddenly eat healthy? Do you breathe fresher air, or see healthier neighbors, i.e. do your real-life problems get solved, when one color’s philosophy writes the rules?

If you think yes, if you think the red vs blue story is an edge of your seat thriller deciding the future of our society, you can stop reading. There’s lots of blogs, shows, and books waiting to sing to their choir, telling you to fight the enemy until you’re blue in the face.

If you don’t like the choir, or you’re starting to realize the "other side" actually suffers many of the same unsolved middle class problems you do, you’d probably like to keep reading. I wrote this book for you.

Whichever color wins an election today and re-writes the rules, regular people will still pay taxes, have a mortage, waste hours in traffic, pay increasing energy bills, under sleep, buy unhealthy food, watch climate change, overpay for questionable education, get pushed around by their health insurance, endure customer abuse, work unpaid overtime, remain micro-managed, and hope their job (which they likely hate) isn’t downsized or outsourced.

Under blue or red rules, our lifestyle stays the same, because the tools in which we live our lives, like suburban homes, gas cars, call centres, centralized power generation, paper based tax forms, mass produced unhealthy food, occasional doctor check ups, television for entertainment, an insatible education industry, and everything else in suburban America and Canada, stays the same.

The rules, no matter what color, don’t control us. The tools we live our life with do. And nothing changes between red and blue, because neither’s philosophy—from conservatism to progressivism, capitalism to Marxism—is about putting new tools into our hands.

It’s not our politicians fault. The philosophies they follow were invented before we had many tools. Horses and carriages and ships pushed by wind moved our stuff. Abacuses and chalkboards did our calculations, the moon lite our way to outdoor latrine pits. These were our primitive tools when red and blue were born. Think of it; their philosophical fathers like Adam Smith, Edmund Burke, John Stuart Mill, Karl Marx, never listened to music, read an eBook, made a phone call, opened a fridge, used electronics, had a genetic test, santized their wounds, used penicillin, knew about electricity, started a motor, learned about evolution, or typed on a keyboard. Yet we let these thinkers guide us in the digital age.

Red and blue philosphies were invented to group humanity into a massive collection action. With red and blue philosophies our farming ancestors came together, industrialized, and built the first rudimentary tools like steam engines, gas cars, indoor toilets, broadcast televisions, and computers the size of rooms. The masses needed to be extras, regulated and managed inside simplistic color coded parties because our tools were primitive. Thus, we couldn’t share with everyone but had to regulate access. To their credit, blue and red philosophies at least gave extras a voice in how our tools’ factories, regulations, and profits were controlled.

Yet today with live in a world far far away from primitive tools. Digital tools are so easy to make that we can customize them for every person’s individual problems. Technologies like high-speed internet, smartphones, machine learning, computer programming, cloud computing, heart rate monitors, 3D printing, genetic tests, air quality sensors, GPS trackers, smart watches, finger-print scanners, thermal cameras, have made tools like Skype, iPhones, Lyft, WhatsApp, Kickstarter, YouTube, Khan Academy, GoogleWear, GitHub, AirBnB, and Firefox so extremely powerful and so easy to make, we don’t need to fight to control them, but fight to spread them. This doesn’t come naturally to us, however, because the rules of old philosophies are based on fighting over, not sharing, tools.

Techvolution is a new philosphy about making regular people the hero of their own story. It does so by empowering them with new tools.

With Techvolution, you won’t fight political battles with bristol boards or painted faces. You’ll economically exercise your right to vote, by deciding which tools best solve your problem at home and work. Unlike me, you’ll never need to deal with any gatekeepers, because you won’t have to knock at anyone’s door asking permission to do what’s best for you.

I’m not talking about an idealic world from storytime. This place of sharing tools already exists. Wikipedia, YouTube, StackOverflow, GitHub, Linux, Mozilla are only a few examples of the wonderful world of cooperation. It’s called the open-source community because software and ideas are “openly shared” to help create new tools. Millions of creators and contributors, designers and coders, who don't care about titles or status but only how well a person solves problems, are already working and living inside a fundamentally new story that’s responsible for our online world. I only want to rid our society of old philosophies holding it back, to let these protagonists prosper.

People often say regular people are addicted to our phones. We aren’t. Checking news feeds, downloading ping-pong games, taking endless photos, is regular people toying around with our new tools. We're learning what they can do. Our ancestors did the same with printed books, cheap muskets, and telescopes, and soon were empowered to read, fight tyrants, and see the universe for themselves. We toy with new tools before we use them to change the world.

So, we're not addicted to our phones. We're learning to use them. New tools are lightsabers, we just need a new philosophy to turn them on. For us today, that’s Techvolution.

# ACT ONE

## Introduction

Fighting to spread the power of new tools is an archetypal human story. Galileo fought a religious establisment with a telescope, George Washington fought a political establishment with a musket, and Steve Jobs fought a economic establishment with an iPod.

Likewise, I want to empower you with tools. Yet, this is not a book about how to invent tools. Amazing books like _Rework_ and _Zero to One_ already do that. Nor is it a book about the history of invention. _The Innovators_ does that better than I could dream. If you want brilliant critiques of our society, _The Incerto_ and _The Great Degeneration_ are already waiting for you. Instead, this is a book about how new tools empower society, and how we can distribute their power to improve the lives of regular people today.

It all comes down to changing the rules of our society with a new philosophy. Todays philosophies don’t mix well with modern technology. They consider us, the middle class, as extras. People who are just around to watch the story unwind around them. Even if we watch our problems pile up at home and at work, we’re not supposed to solve them until we pass through the gatekeepers of old tools in government bureaucracies, bloated corporations, high-end lawyer offices, or endless consultant meetings. This is the equivalent of Blockbuster writing rules to protect itself and keep on reigning in an era of YouTube and Netflix; basically, the opposite of evolution.

Techvolution is inspired by Nature. Notice gatekeeper’s don’t exist there. Evolution doesn’t have anyone telling a cheetah she’s running too fast, that the ants are too cooperative, or that a camel is too water efficient. Lifeforms adapt as best they can to their own problems and the winners survive. There are no middleman, no gatekeepers, just problem solvers. And the problem solvers prevail.

Human biological adaptions have effectively stopped. We'll never biologically evolve to solve our problems. We'll never fly, do advanced calculations, or breath Martian air. Humanity continues life's evolution with tools. We're basically cyborgs who adapt and solve problems by upgrading our tools to the lastest problem in transportation, calculation, and breathing. Hold a plane joystick, calculator, or space suit, and you're a different cyborg each time.

However, our problem solving is held back by old philosophies that empower gatekeepers. People in control of old tools like Blockbuster, getting to decide when, and if, humanity will upgrade our tools.

In _Star Wars_, the Force is an all powerful energy field. Luke Skywalker's Jedi warriors harness the light side to help others. Darth Vader's evil Sith harness the dark side to help themselves.

We call technological protagonsts "trailblazers". Like Jedi, they empower us cyborgs with new tools. But since some gates are good, like the security ones, we don't have a political name for the antagonists. Thus, I call antagonists to our technological evolution Darth Blockbuster. They are the people who prevent human evolution for their self-interest.

Biological upgrades and adaptions is called evolution. I call human technological evolution _Techvolution_. This book is about inventing Techvolution, a philosophy to re-write the rules of society, to kill Darth Blockbuster, so regular people can solve our problems with technological upgrades as smoothly in human society, as natural selection does in nature.

And to make it happen, you, the current extra, have to join the fight. Because victory depends on you picking the right side between an old ruling philosophy and this new one.

# CAST OF IDEAS AND CHARACTERS

Before we go any futher, I want to lay out the philosophy of Techvolution more clearly. To do so, here are a few terms that will enable us to all be on the same page:

===

Philosophy: the largely unspoken ideals that tell members of society what’s right and wrong, good and bad, in science, art, morals, politics and economics. Philosophy is a civilization's collective consciousness used by members to make rules around questions like: what is scientific truth? Who should govern? And how should resources be organized?

Ruling philospophy: is a civilization’s chosen philosophy. One that all factions agree on. Like the “Divine Rights of Kings” derived from Christian theology used in royalist Europe, “Marxist-Leninism” of the Soviet Union, or the combination of “red / blue” philosophies of our philosophy today.

Rule book: the largely unspoken fashion, etiquette, workplace, rules that govern everyday life. The rule book is interpreted from the ruling philosophy.

Technology: a catchall term for things we make tools from, like concrete, lumber, nails, shingles, insulation, and bricks.

Tool: a catchall term for things we create with technology to solve a problem, like guns to kill bad guys, books to record and pass on knowlege, and houses to shelter in.

Frontline: The point of contact between a tool and the problem. A movie usher talking to moviegoers, nurses giving vaccines, cleaners cleaning a city bus, police chasing a robber, soldiers on the battlefield. People on the frontline have jobs to solve problems.

Hierarchy: Every tool develops a power structure to manage its use in society. Kings and queens having the keys to the castle for example. We reward those who rise in hierarchies with power and prestige. People in the hierachy have titles like prince and executive to mark their position inside the power structure.

Civilization story: The invention of new technology and creation of new tools to overcome whatever problem troubles us. We use tools to evolve.

Protagonists: people who invent, spread, and use new technology and new tools for the greater good. Usually close to the problems on the frontline, they individually struggle, but their continued self-sacrifice slowly improves life on Earth. I call them Jedi. We call their leaders trailblazers who often skirt the rules; Nikola Tesla, Steve Jobs, Michael S. Hart, Bill Gates, Linus Torvalds, Elon Musk.

Antagonists: people who selfishly resist new tools to defend their wealth, power, and prestige. Often called establishment or elites, antagonists usually manage companies or institutions based on dated technologies and think working on the frontline is beneath them. They work to control the rule book so they can hide behind it. We don't often individually identify them. I invented "Darth Blockbuster" so we can.

Extras: everybody in the middle of a battle between antagonist and protagonist. Because they have no direct loyalty to either side or their tools, extras can pick winners and losers. Usually extras are in the middle class; not so poor as to be desperate, but not so powerful they want to keep the world the same. Sadly, extras don't realize their power.

The Death Star: What I call the rule book when its controlled by Darth Blockbuster. Today it exists inside countless government regulations, corporation manuals, and social etiquette that prevent new tools being used by people.

Techvolution: a new philosophy empowering seemless human technological evolution by ridding Darth Blockbuster of his power, by empowering extras to decide when society should upgrade our tools.

## Nice to Meet You, Skywalker

And the story begins. Not in a foreign city, mythical world, or galaxy far far away. Right here and now, whereever you are on this Earth. We need to change up ruling philosophy to take advantage of digital tools. Only you can make it happen.

A little about me first. I'm nobody special. In my youth I was a cleaner, drywaller, movie usher, and die-hard ideologue. After dropping that bad habit, I studied technological innovation at the University of Toronto, mostly while working full-time. I'm grateful I never the frontine after graduation. I learned far more about innovation as a line worker, an account manager, a claims adjuster. Making an app and meeting my personal Darth Blockbuster was very enlightening. All this taught me Techvolution.

So that's a snapshot. But I'm not important. You are. Because from hospital cleaners, to internet technical support, nursing to adjusting, only workers on the frontline know the tools our society needs to fix our many problems.

So although today you're an extra in battle between Jedi and Sith, you are the hero of Techvolution. It's not surprising. Average joes are always the heroes. Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Neo, and Cinderella were regular people. They became heroes when called upon to defeat the bad guys.

Now you're called upon. Like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Morpheus, or the fairy godmother, I'm merely the guide to teach you how to defeat the villians. So the time is now young Skywalker, to leave the farm, and join the rebellion.

What is the rebellion. It's definitely not rallies, marches, or protests. It's a rebellion of the mind. We have to change our ruling philosophy. We have to destroy Darth Blockbuster's rule book, what I call the Death Star, for it keeps him in power, and prevents us all using new tools to solve the many frontline problems that puts the middle class in massive student debt, stuck in traffic, and in general struggling to keep up.

# ACT TWO - THE DEATH STAR

## The Magic of Evolution

Well young Skywalker, before you go off and face Darth Blockbuster, you have to learn some things. The most important being the all powerful energy field inside every lifeform. No not the Force. I'm talking about evolution.

Evolution empowers life by giving every new lifeform a slightly different variationss. This way life can constantly test for environmental changes in things like water levels, temperature, and food supply. The variations unfit for the frontline die off, while the fittest survive. This natural selection is how evolution finds which lifeforms best represent life on Earth.

Evolutions works so well because it creates biodiversity. The more lifeforms there are, the more life can probe and therefore better adapt to environmental changes. When temperatures increase or rain patterns change, high biodiversity means more lifeform feel frontline pain, respond faster, and thereby keep life's evolution going.

If the environment is stable however lifeforms need a caretaker. Someone to keep them in shape, ready to act for when the environment does change. That's why nature put in a system of checks and balances called ecosystems. Inside ecosystems is where lifeforms make communities and cooperate to mimick environmental changes by keeping each other on their toes.

Ecosystems are a food chain of different plants, herbivores, carinvores, and decomposers. Each lifeform checks the other's excesses and makes sure everyone reciprocates to keep the ecosystems' nutrients flowing in balance. Checks and balances and reciprocation is how ecosystems make sure life keeps evolving in good times.

Evolution may not be the Force, but it's certainly magical. Without any lifeform being aware of its tricks, evolution turned a lifeless planet into an oasis. The big drawback is time. Biological variations take millions of years to respond to environmental changes. Think of the poor polar bears. They'll never understand why the ice isn't coming. And even if they could, no lifeform can proactively change their biology.

In contrast, humanity can change (hopefully in time to help the polar bears). Not our biology. But our "cyborgology" if you will, because we feel frontline pain, reflect on the problems causing them, and create a new tool to overcome.

Techvolution is therefore intentional evolution. A better form of evolution that isn't a magical mystery, like evolution is to polar bears, but something we can understand. Question is, what drives us to evolve, when the rules often say it's wrong?

## The Majic of Techvolution

We call it genius when someone uses existing technology to make a new tool. Happily these trailblazers are self-motivated, and we already celebrate their genius and innovations. Heck, even Darth Blockbuster often loves their work. But innovation isn't the only step to Techvolution. Only when the extras use a tool do we evolve.

So what trick does nature play on the extras to use new tools and risk Darth Blockbuster's wrath. Like evolution, the trick lives within our souls.

Unlike evolution, the trick is not magic, because extras understand they're dropping one tool and attaching another; like swapping out the DVD player for Netlix. Yet, there's still something wonderfully mystical about choosing to leave ones's comfort zone and learn a new cyborgolgy. It's like a desert fox putting on a swimsuit, flippers, and goggles, and diving into the ocean yelling "I can do this!".

Changing our tools is so wonderfully brave, mysterious, and difficult, I call it majic. Pronounced like magic, but different so we know it's the free choice of a regular person to upgrade to a new tool and continue humanity's evolution.

Think of majic like a bonding agent. Carbon atoms are sticky and thereby bond other atoms to form the Universe's many molecules. Genius in the protagonists minds bonds existing ideas into original ones. Good storytelling bonds audiences with different worlds and characters. And majic bonds extras with a new tool.

Techvolution is the ruling philosophy letting extras majically bond with any tool that helps them solve frontline problems. The rules can get in the way. We can sort that out with a short lesson.

![Wikipedia development](/img\diagrams\techvolution-majic.png)

* Note: Majić is my family name. I lucked out it reads like "magic" in english. It's egotistical to use it here I know, but I couldn't think of a better word. I'm especially using it for my parents. They've been overworked all their life yet still always cleaned and built stuff for other people with care. I wanted to retire them. Instead, I can name the act by which a regular person upgrades their cyborgology, and improves humanity, in their name.

* Sticking it to my personal Darth Blockbuster makes me smile too.

## The Lesson

Despite our problems with our current one, society always needs a ruling philosophy. Darth Blockbuster fights to control it. When he does, he write rules to keep the tools he controls, and therefore himself, in power. Corporate manuals, univeristy guidelines, social justice blogs are among the pages of his Death Star rule book. These rules interfere with regular people majically forming bounds with new tools.

Maybe. Whose to know which rules are the bad ones. Maybe they're interfering with majic. Maybe they're just good rules. Darth Blockbuster doesn't tell people he's Darth Blockbuster. Instead he says he's an an Executive Vice President, Human Resources Representative, or high priced lawyer. So we need to clearly identify the difference between majic and rules, and thereby filter out the good and bad rules.

This lessons takes us to small farm in Maryland, and a young boy who worked hard to better himself.

===

Our story is about a Maryland farm boy overcoming ignorance with tools. The farm is one of those classic farms you might have seen on shows like "Little House on the Prarire". Salt of the earth farmers raising crops and families in 19th century rural America. Wikipedia or Khan Academy or didn't exist. Not even many books either. So, you only knew about your own way of life.

The boy Frederick worked the fields with his mother. It was hard labour of course, there weren't many machines back in the 19th Century, but humanity is used to sweeting when cultivating the Earth. The boy worked hard, he wanted to keep his mother happy and fed. She wanted the same for her boy.

In a few years, the boy was sent to work with a relative in Baltimore. The house was large and the young family could use a hand around the house; cleaning, shopping, doing chores. It made his mother happy he wouldn't sweat so much, yet the boy was a farmer and unsure of the big city.

The father of the house was Hugh. He wasn't around much though. His new wife Sophia was. She was a foreigner used to colder climates, who didn't know many people yet, so she stayed in a lot. Sophia was nice and treated the boy nice too. Not as a farmer, but as a interesting person; not something farm hands were used to from rich people. She made Frederick feel at ease.

One day, Sophia handed Frederick a list of items to pick up from the store. Frederick's eyes looked down, his shoulders slouched, like a dog who disappointed its masters. Frederick mumbled "I can't read miss Sophia."

Sophia responded, "My God, well that won't do! Reading is good. How else can a person give and receive information from... from... the world! I'll teach you, we'll do it together." So Sophia taught Frederick to read. Just a few weeks, and he got the basics.

The world indeed! All those markings in the store, on street corners, in books, in newspapers, in the Holy Bible, they're each a new world! Go left, turn right, open, closed, discounted, welcome, and Salvation, all this stuff a door to a new world.

Frederick danced to the store, he whisked himself to do his chores, because he was learning more everyday. The world kept getting bigger, information kept pouring in.

One day Hugh came home early. He saw Sophia and Frederick reading at the dinner table.

Hugh walked into the room. "Boy, get out, and wait in the hallway. Face the wall."

Frederick got out, waited outside, and faced the wall. Seconds turned to minutes. Frederick rolled the newspaper in his hands tighter. He didn't want to go back to the farm. But even more, he didn't want his angel to get in trouble.

Inside the room, Sophia was curious "What is it? Everyone learns to read in Ohio"

Hugh responded "This isn't Ohio. He is a slave. What do you think happens when slaves reads. Do you think he won't start thinking."

Sophia's eyes went wide. "I didn't know the rules."

Hugh responded "Teach him."

As Frederick heard the hallway door open, he grips his newspaper.

Sophia said, in no angelic voice, "Turn around."

Frederick does, and looks at his angel, the one who talked with him like he was a person. And she looked back and only saw _her boy_.

Sophia slaped the newspaper from her boy's hand. He didn't let go. She slapped again, and again and again. Each slap hurt more than a dozen whips on his scarred back.

She slapped, and slapped, and slapped, and slapped. She will not do evil. She will not break the rules. Frederick's angel became a demon. Sophia was clicked by society's rules. Now she was a believer philosophy of racism to justify human slavery.

Frederick's world shut. The one white person ignorant enough to treat him like a person, was now an educated convert to the rules that put him into chains. Physical chains if needed, but evil prefers mental chains of ignorance; they stay on so much easier.

Weeks later Frederick was still in despair. His daily routine was the same. Yet, working under demonic masters is just different. He didn't dance to the store, he didn't whisk to do his chores, and he never saw Sophia smile again. Demons are always on guard.

One day, Frederick saw a newspaper, the avenue to knowledge whose path Fredereick was once on. He looked at the markings, saw some words he knew, and one word he didn't. Yet he still stared at it. Why?

The answer slapped him harder than the demon ever did, he read the words "The Freedom States in the North". He heard the word freedom before, but he didn't know freedom was a real place.

A shockwave went through him when he realized if slavery was a place, then so must freedom be a place too. Here Frederick realized he could break his own chains. Because ignorance was always his demon, and knowledge was always his angel. And he fought ignorance, and received knowledge, whenever he read.

So, Frederick taught himself to read. He practiced with ignorant white kids on the streets. He practiced reading items at the grocery store. He practiced on every street sign. And he practiced everytime he was at the Baltimore dock; the dock I said, you know the place, where ships will take you anywhere in the world. If you can read the schedule.

One day Sophia waited for her boy to return. But the boy died when the man Frederick Douglass walked onto the ship headed north to freedom. The man knew the exact time, place, and fare he needed to get on. He read it, himself, on the schedule. Reading opened the world to Frederick, and now the free world was opened to him.

The story gets better. Frederick Douglass becomes a brilliant orator and writer. In a world with no radio, video, or telephones, he travels the Northern States and Europe telling everyone the truth about slavery. When the American Civil War (1861-1865) broke out, his books help make Britain reject recognizing the South, and thus deprived it of a much needed support. The irony of a slave educating people about slavery, and thereby helping to end slavery is amazing to me.

Note innovation wasn't Douglass' problem. Using a tool was.

## Douglass' Lessons

Frederick Douglass is a true Jedi Master. His great bravery, persistence, and intelligence showcase humanity's endless potential. The big lesson we need to learn here Skywalker, is using majic to tell the difference between good and bad rules.

Sophia taught Douglass to read. She wasn't told to. She did it because we naturally love teaching tools. Whatever our joys are, from boxing, fishing, or reading, we love spreading them. We love it, because spreading majic is even cooler than performing magic.

When a magician makes a playing card disappear, we smile in awe and childish wonder. That's really cool, but nothing new was created, so we soon lose our joy. However, when a majician connects someone with reading, they've similarly performed something awesome, but its not a trick; they've upgraded someone's cyborgology and effectively created a new and improved person. And that keeps our smile going for a long time.

Yet human made rules _sometimes_ say upgrading to a new tool is wrong. Medieval parishoners couldn't read a science book, peasant farmers couldn't have a musket, a 1990's kid couldn't download a digital song. Today millions of tired mothers can't telecommute. Why?

There is no easy answer. Society's rule book doesn't proclaim itself to be a Death Star. The lesson Skywalker is it'll never be easy to know the difference between good and bad rules. We make them so quickly, and they pile up so fast, to filter out the bad ones.

Majic is our best judge of the rules. It naturally makes us smile. From teaching a kid to walk, to teaching a grandmother to use Skype to watch her grandkids first steps, teaching and learning new tools opens our hearts because it solves problems, and improves our way of life.

So, when you're teaching or learning a new tool and someone steps in your way with a rule, ask yourself if you feel majic, and if you do, ask the rulemaker why he doesn't. Perhaps there's a good reason. But keep Sophia in mind. Performing majic made her fell good, while following the rules only made her feel safe.

And safety is fleeting Skywalker. No ruling philosophy lasts forever, thus all rule books eventually expire. Majic never will. It always was and always will be in our souls to test our rules.

Like Sophia ignore majic at your peril. She gave one of our greatest writers and orators his start, yet she lived a miserable life watching him succeed because she broke the rules. Rules of a society that was on its last legs anyway. That should help you decide which rules are worth following.

## A World With No Majic

Skywalker, the extras are struggling. Because we solve problems with tools, we need Techvolution, the freedom to choose our tools, to fight back. We already have Jedi in the open-source community creating new tools to solve frontline problems. We already have extras feeling the pain of frontline problems. What we don't have is the freedom of extras to majically form bonds with new tools.

Darth Blockbuster has turned society's rule book into his Death Star. Ever since the first digital protagonists like Grace Hopper, Jay Last, Vint Cerf, and Al Alcorn created digital tools en masse in the 1970's, he's written contracts nobody can understand, regulations nobody can read, and enforces politically correct behavior nobody likes. Our society's biggest problems like personal isolation, political hatred, and climate change, are wounds of the Death Star's many laser blasts.

Let's look at the world going south in the 1970ss, because society increasingly ignored majic and instead followed the increasingly immense rule back of Darth Blockbuster.

## Things Won't Change, Until

Most of our problems started in the 1970's for a reason. That's when protagonists's created digital tools, and Darth Blockbuster showed up to keep our car driving, suburban living, broadcast television watching, 9-5 working, unhealthy food eating, univeristy admission test taking lifestyle going. Despite totally new tools, the American way of life hasn't changed. It's still the "American Dream" to live in a post World War II baby boomer suburb.

Thus, red / blue politics fight old fights. They fight to "fairly" allocate the control, regulation, and profit, of primitive tools. For example, because university libraries and lecture halls are still considered "formal education", red / blue endlessly debate who should get into university and how the masive expense should be paid. Endless battles over affirmative action, student loan rates, and state education subsidies are the result.

While better tools are ignored. Digital tools can educate anyone willing. Wikipedia, YouTube, Khan Academy, Udemy, Skillshare, Brilliant, The Great Courses, are merely the first new digital education tools. They do wonderful jobs, yet are funded for a tiny fraction of formal education, and get no official support. We don't teach kids to read or update Wikipedia in schools. We don't track their progress in Khan Academy's micro-lessons. We defintely don't recognize "degrees" from Udemy, or YouTube, even though most programmers and designers learn far more there then in any college classroom.

And thus our society suffers. Despite way too much carbon in the atmostphere, housing bubble bursts, massive student debt, and horrible individual health, we keep living the same way, under the rules of a aged ruling philosophy, with rules written by antagonists. Our entire climate is changing because our ruling philosophy is not.

Middle class quality of life, political cooperation, and climate change, won't get better until the extras join the protagonists, step-up to the antagonists, and change their ruling philosophy. Only then will the world change. Our world stays damaged, waiting for Techvolution.

So Skywalker, that's why you need to join rebellion of the mind. Let's look at one of the battles already fought.

## First Battle Scene

### Introductionnn

In the 1970's the transistor, internet, computer monitors, and other digital technology, started to leave labs and research centres and make their way into products. Finally, after centuries of primitive tools, society had ones cheap enough to mass produce, yet powerful enough to change our way of life. Of course, that's when Darth Blockbuster appeared and went to work defending his way of life.

Some examples. In the 1970's AT&T defended their telephone monopoly by successfully lobbying government to ban Americans from using internet modems. In 1984, the entertainment industry defended broadcast television by unsuccessfuly suing home video recorders. In 2001, the music industry defended music Compact Discs by successfully suing digital songs. Throughout society the antagonists found ways to prevent the majical possibilities digital tools offered society to technologically evolve.

The antagonists even resisted help. As Napster was introducing digital songs to America, and being sued for it, Steve Jobs wanted to improve digital songs with iTunes. Music executives had already tried and failed horribly. With no options, and despite the supposed crisis of Napster, Jobs said he'd " never spent so much of my time trying to convince people [music exceutives] to do the right thing for themselves".

The problem wasn't Napster. It was Darth Blockbuster. New tools questioned who should be on top. So the the people on top resisted change, even from Steve Jobs. From Galileo to Washington, Tesla to Jobs, the battle between antagonits, protagoinsts, and extras has always been the same. Here's how it breaks down.

### How New Tools Start the Fight

Technological evolution is like its biological cousin. There are adaptations of existing lifeforms, and totally new lifeforms. In technology this the difference between a new technology, and a new tool.

Upgrading a technology is an iterative change, like going from Sedan's to SUV's, tube televisons's to LCD's, VHS to DVD's. Each is different technologically, but they do the same job, so no political battles are started. No new majic is required to attract users.

But when we've upgraded enough technologies, like microchips, touchscreens, batteries, and WiFi, a genius can unlock a new tool like smartphones. And this is a big deal.

![New Tool Creation](/img\prologue\techvolution-new-tool-creation-pc.png)

Why? Well, because creating a new tool asks a climactic and political question: who controls it? After all, whoever does, is more powerful. The weilder can let extras majically connect with new tools to solve their problems. Or withold new tools and convince the extras to keep using old tools with techniques like advertising, culture, and spectacle. Techniques I call dark majic. Like heavily advertised muscle cars with V8 horsepower in the era of Teslam dark majic keeps extras holding an old tool.

Thus, while civilization is a struggle to overcome problems by upgrading technology and inventing new tools, it’s also a battle to control them. The people with the old tool fight to retain their power, while inventors and innovators imagine a new society that shares it.

The eternal story of civilization is thus protagonists making new tools, antagonists attacking new tools, and many extras watching them fight. Our politics is an ongoing history of technological change, with protagonist and antagonist both reaching for the tool to make themselves the winner.

Today the extras are not self-aware of their power to decide the winner. I’ll show you how important you are. Here’s how you changed the world just by being curious and loving majic.

![Dist-vs-retention](/img\prologue\techvolution-distribution-vs-rentention-2.png)

### Extras Killed Wikipedia's Evil Twin

The environment keeps changing. Life needs to know how, and uses its lifeforms to probe for answers. Similarly, people always have some nagging question. Like how Tesla engine works, or what happened to the electric car. Constant questions are a problem and we need a reference tool to solve it. True to ourselves, we make one with the technology available and upgrade it when possible.

Our first reference tool was the wisdom of our elders. The first technological upgrades were papyrus scrolls and ink (500 BC) and books (500), which turned some elders into experts like Hippocrates and Aristotle. When wood-pulp paper (1200) and the printing press (1456) were invented, humanity unleashed mass-produced books. Now experts could share knowledge between themselves and educate the masses. We called the reference books encyclopedias.

People loved encyclopedias. For the first time, many answers were available on demand. The _Encyclopedia Britannica_ (1878) was the standard. It went into continuous publication (1933) to keep people updated to the latest facts. In the following decades, the computer, digital printer, and telecommunications meant encyclopedias were written and stored digitally. But they remained a set of printed books and CD's controlled by experts.

Then came the world wide web (1991), a new technology that unlocked many new tools like websites, forums, blogs, and something called “wikis”. Wiki software lets anyone write or edit a webpage by pressing “edit now”. All changes are saved, so anyone can erase errors or vandalism by pressing “undo now”. For years programmers used wikis to collaboratively write technical manuals.

As web tools boomed in the late ’90’s, protagonist Jimmy Wales wondered if the web could upgrade encyclopedias. Today, most of us who were curious about things electric cars know our quest ends with a free online encyclopedia anyone can edit called Wikipedia. But it didn’t start out that way.

Wikipedia started as Nupedia (2000). Nupedia was a free online copycat of Encyclopedia Britannica where only “expert” professors made articles. Wikipedia (2001) was a side project. Only programmers knew “community content creation” would work.

Everyone else assumed regular people would only read the work of professors. The first issue with this theory was that the professors didn’t like to share their knowledge. In its first year, Nupedia had 12 articles. Wikipedia had 40,000, which most professors loved to belittle as rubbish, and disallowed students from referencing them in their papers. Yet professors refused to improve, or to assign students to improve, Wikipedia.

The second issue was that it turned out “expert” answers and “regular” answers are the same. Electric cars us A/C motors no matter who says it. And thirdly, most importantly, Wikipedia made majic so easy many extras became protagonists! A huge community of non-academics voluntarily shared their knowledge one “edit now” at a time and fiercely protected their common knowledge with “undo now”. Nobody told them, paid them or made a rule to encourage it. Because performing majic is its own reward.

And lastly, the remaining extras flocked to Wikipedia. While most people didn't contribute, they still ignored the rules, and felt the majic of learning a new tool to help them answer their questions. The extra’s mass support quickly made Wikipedia king, while giving Nupedia and Encyclopedia Britannica quick deaths.

That’s the story of Wikipedia. Made by new protagoinsts, made the standard reference tool by empowered extras. Few believed it was possible, because even professors don’t understand new tools always unpower the few, to empower the rest. Interestingly, after I finally conceded temporary defeat to my personal Darth Blockbuster, I uploaded a few pages to Wikipedia instead. Not as helpful as my app, but it took just a few weeks of work, and one “edit now” button, to make it real. It felt majical to bypass the rules.

![Wikipedia development](/img\prologue\techvolution-enclyclopedia-book-wiki.png)

### You Can Win

Wikipedia's victory is another example of the archetypal human story. Like Galileo and his telescope, George Washington and his musket, and Steve Jobs and his iTunes. Wikipedia was a victory for protagonists against antagonists. What makes it especially cool, is the extras played such a big part.

And that’s the story Skywalker I want you to join with lightsabers a-blazin’, dicing up old tools like evil storm troopers, to smooth out humanity’s natural evolution. In addition to Wikipedia, StackOverflow, GitHub, Bitbucket, Vimeo, and many others are empowering individuals to become protagonists.

Note however, our lives cut across thousands to millions of problems. Thus, our villians are not in a massive group like “the rich” or the “the unions” as old philosophies label. Our villians reveal themselves inside thousands of companies, institutions, and organizations, by suppressing majic of new tools, so they can keep their version of the DVD alive.

The extras can kill all these Darth Blockbusters. I know this because our battle today was fought generations ago with his master, Darth King.

Darth King lived inside palaces, using society’s money to host splendid banquests and balls. His absolute power was hidden inside a ruling philosophy of the “noble’s divine right to rule”. Slowly, as protagonists invented scientific instruments, books, and guns, a new philosophy was born. A philosophy of science and enlightenment, political equality and democracy, made real when the protagonists and extras fought as one in the American and French Revolutions. They were inspired by the new philosophy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

![Battle Scene](/img\prologue\techvolution-battle-scene.png)

## Rousseau's Extras

### Freeing Cinderella

“Extras are born free; and everywhere they are in chains.” That’s paraphrasing Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who wrote that in 1762. Was Rosseau the King of France? He wasn’t. Was he the richest man in England? Absolutely not. Rousseau was a poor writer who copied sheets of music to make the rent. More than 300 years later, he is recognized as being a great philosopher, a political visionary, and a protagonist who helped free the world with his new philosophy.

Rousseau lived when kings and queens, dukes and duchesses ruled civilization. A time when Mozart played inside exquisite palaces during the nobility’s many banquets and balls. This was the image of opulence that had Cinderella dreaming her days away as she cleaned a dirty chateau. Sadly, unlike the the fairy tale, the extras didn’t have a fairy Godmother to make their dreams come true. Instead, the commoners cleaned the noble’s vast libraries, used guns while dying in their wars, and wondered what it looked like through a telescope. The extras were excluded from the power of new tools because they believed their beloved Holy Bible said only noble people had the “divine right to rule”.

Rousseau called bullshit. In truth, Jesus was a carpenter, a commoner just like any other extra—you could argue—who rose above the masses and became the ultimate protagonist. Who is to say that other extras can’t live up to their own potential? Rousseay said books, guns, and scientific instruments should liberate the extras who were only in chains for the happiness of con artists. The self-proclaimed “divine nobility” didn’t like hearing that. This powerful self-protecting community of Darth Kings declared Rousseau a banquet-pooper, and chased him out of Switzerland, France, and England. Maybe that’s why Rousseau rented instead of owned.

Starting in 1776, within Rousseau’s lifetime, Darth King started to face the music when the American people started a revolution. One year after he died, the French had their own revolution in 1789. And on it went from country to country because Rousseau, and others like him, make the extras realize they should become protagonists in a civilization “of the people, for the people, by the people”. Cinderella soon forgot about the fancy ball, and instead played the music of freedom, in a choir of equals that sounded something like this:

>Do you hear the people sing?
Singing a song of angry men?
It is the music of a people
Who will not be slaves again
When the beating of your heart
Echo’s the beating of the drums
There is a life about to start
When tomorrow comes!

Revolutionary songs like this spread the people’s liberty, equality, and fraternity throughout the world. In a few years, civilization changed its philosphy from knowing the nobles were divine, to knowing they were villians. When the people took control of books, guns, and science, they put presidents and senators, judges and sherriffs in power, who ruled at the request of new protagonists who built a civilization with checks and balances, because no one was divine. A change empowered by tools, thought of in philosophy, yet made real with the bloodshed of revolutions.

Rousseau died never having found a home. After they won their revolutions, a population of heroes put him to rest inside the glorious Panthéon, heralding him as a renowned breaker of chains, in a free world he helped build. Where any guy can be the prince, and any girl can be Cinderella.

The question for us is, how did Rousseau do it?

![Revolutions!](/img\prologue\techvolution-revolution.png)

## The Road to Techvolution, and the Death of Revolutions

Rousseau, a poor writer, changed history by making the people realize they suffered on the frontline because the ruling philosophy was old. See, even though the people didn't have telescopes, guns, or books, society did. Thus, the people were continually disadvantaged. It's like a student at university today. He can use Wikipedia to find an answer, but still isn't allowed to reference it in term-papers. So he spends hours searching through books instead.

Likewise, even though French and Americans could read up on current events, they still couldn't vote. Even though they could use muskets to defend their own land, they were fighting wars to expand the king's glory. Rousseau made the people realize this was bullshit.

The people's demand for change started a revolution, a sudden questioning of a civilization’s ruling philosophy. The American, French and all the others in the 19th centuries were violent, because the divide between ruling philosophy, and frontline society, was so wide.

It's a lesson for us, as we start this Techvolution. We have to hurry up. Because the longer we wait to update our ruling philosophy to digital tools, the more out of touch the frontline and ruling philosophy gets. The result is needless revolution. All the more reason for a Techvolution now.

## Revolution

Skywalker, you look tense. I get why. Revolutions are tough. Maybe we should get the bristol boards out, smear the face paint, and fight! Fight for free college education! Fight for less regulations! Fight for affordable health insurance! Fight for tax cuts! Let's march and yell!

What color do you want. See the trap there? No matter how hard one side pushes, the other side matches. A recipe for inaction, which Darth Blockbuster funds to keep himself in power.

There is no answer for contemporary problems using old philosophies. I know red /blue is easy and comfortable, but if you want that, cable news and their wise pundits are waiting.

So keep the marches and protests of red / blue out of your mind. We're inspired by, but not repeatting, _Les Miserables_. Fighting for change doesn't mean to grab hold of the commanding heights of primitive tools. We have digital tools. We can make endless products and apps to solve each peron's individual problems. Once we have Techvolution, the freedom to choose the best tools to solve our problems at home, work, and leisure.

We might have too many choices actually. Windows or Mac? iPhone or Android? Tesla or Ford? Car or walking? Uber of Lyft? Mailing wedding invitations, or call and ask your friends to the party? Milk or rice milk? What shoes to buy. Which podcasts to listen to. Should you really skip university and self-learn? If the generic "American Dream" is bad, the specific one is daunting. We have to filter the good choices and tools, from the bad.

We will. And we'll use Rousseau to do it.

## Ruling Philosophy

Rousseau said the nobility were con artists. They who hid behind divinity to rule society for their self interest. Yet noble families ruled every European country. There had to be some reason for it, and there was. At first these families were declared holy by the people, because they were holy.

I'll tell a quick story to explain. It starts with the fall of Western Rome. Rome started as a republic in 753 BC, and became a Empire in 27 BC. After several centuries of prosperity, around 180, the Roman Empire started to suffer a general decline. Years of civil wars, declining population, bloated civil administration, greedy military, lazy civilians, stupid emperors, relentless barbarian invasions, and the pacificying effects of Christianty. Finally in 476 western Rome fell apart. It was chaos. Society returned to zero. The water didn't run. The judges didn't rule. The military didn't defend. Almost like a zombie apocolypse movie.

No kidding. Vikings raided, Arabs invaded, Vandals roamed. This is when the Dark Ages (500 - 1000) started. We call it the Dark Ages, because there is literally little record of anything. Few people wrote records, histories, manuscripts. Western Europe went "dark". In times of such anarchy, the people needed security above all else. Whoever stopped the zombies must surely be holy.

The former Roman province of Gaul was at the centre of chaos. Native Celts were pushed out to Wales, Scotland, and Ireland by invading Frankish tribes. These tribes who added to the chaos by warring with each other. Eventually however, a winner prevailed. In 486 Clovis I (466-511), established a new kingdom. His dynasty ruled for centuries. Each new generation returned more law and order, and military protection, to the Kingdom of France.

The kingdom was backed by the one remaining Roman institution, the Roman Catholic Church. The churhes priests told the people to cherish their nobility. Sermons told the people, the Bible says kings are God's chosen representatives. The people couldn't read, but it didn't take much convincing. Raids, invasions, and attacks were less and less. With peace came better farming, trade, and growth. The nobles divine right to rule was an idea the people supported. They could see the defeated invaders, and feel the full stomachs for themselves. Divinity was a logical reality.

The problem with the story of the nobles divine right to rule, wasn't the divinity of the original nobles. France's Kings after Clovis I, like Charles Martel (688-741) and Charlemagne (742-814), all fought on many battlefields to protect their people while making rules to help them prosper. Of course they were protecting their power and taxpayers too. But that's the point. The leaders and the people had a symbiotic relationship.

And it worked. Soon after Charlemagne, Europe left the Dark Ages and entered the High Middle Ages (1000 - 1300). This time wasn't all the bad to live in, with relative peace, security, and wealth not seen since Rome's peak. We still celebrate it with "Medieval Times" and "Game of Thrones" stories.

The problem with the story, is the nobles divine right to rule didn't have a conclusion. As Europe travelled through the High Middle Ages, Late Middle Ages, Renaissance, Enlightenment, Europe kept getting more peaceful and richer.

All the wealth was going to the divine nobility. Now long removed from fighting Vikings or Vandals, these nobles told themselves they were divine because of their "noble blood". The nobility that Rousseau knew, didn't live in castles, wearing body armour of war heroes. They lived in opulant palaces and enjoyed endless banquets and balls. Cinderella wasn't even allowed in!

Here's a few paintings to showcase the change. One's of Charles Martel, and his people. The other of Louis XVI (1754-1793), and his people.

![Martel to Louis](/img\techvolution-martel-louis.png)

Opulance and wealth. They're like signs of a ruling philosophy gone on too long. Early nobles wrote rules to encourage new tools forming majically connections with regular people and improving society for everyone. In the Middle Ages, peasant farmers were supposed to make tills to harvest more food, use screws to dig good wells, work iron to make lots of barrels.

However, as new tools kept getting more powerful, the nobles wrote rules to keep them away from the extras. Books, muskets, scientific instruments were all personally empowering. They were kept away from the people by dark majic. Tricks to prevent the people from connecting with new tools, to upgrade their cyborgology, and stay dependant on old tools.

Extras holding muskets died on countless battlefields wars for the nobles personal "glory". The Wars of Spanish Succession, Austrian Succession, Seven Years War, and more, all fought between countries that were no longer kingdoms trying to keep society together after Rome's collapse. But nation-states, with large bureaucracies, in which the nobility were merely executives, usually too distracted with court dramas and planning the next banquet.

The nobles used dark majic to trick the people into thinking wars, and banquets and balls were for everyone's benefit. Church sermons were sppken from spectularly built churches and cathedrals, while they kept saying God sent the nobles to rule. Priests on the frontline felt the pain of the people, yet bishops and cardinals not so much. Distanced from the frontline was the divider between those happy with the ruling philosophy, and those who wanted a new one.

Here's an example of the divide. Louis XIV made a program to let French peasants visit the Palace at Versailles. Tours were free, and only required a hat and coat (spares were available for rent). Louis wanted "his people" to see how glorious his kingdom was. He thought once the people saw entire rooms made of gold, and hallways of mirrors, they'd see how lucky they were to live in France. The irony that most peasants had never even looked into a mirror, and therefore had never even seen their own face, didn't occur to Louis.

The large divide between ruling philosophy, and frontline problems, marked the impending end of the nobles divine right to rule. It was a change seen in the change of early nobles castles and armour, used to defend their people, into palaces and dresses, used to enjoy a fun time at society's expense. Banquets and balls marked the impending end of Darth King. We need to understand exactly why to help forecast our problems. And our answer is in mastering stories.

## Jedi Training

### Jedi Introduction

Skywalker, you're doing well. But if you're going to topple Darth Blockbuster, you need to learn the advanced stuff. In the first battle scene, the one with Wikipedia, we learned how new technology is made into new tools, and when a new tool is created, there's a battle between protagonists and antagonists, both reaching for the new tool to make themselves the winner.

Europe's divine nobles kept winning this battle. The nobles spent society's money on their personal banquets, balls, and palaces, until the people revolted with bent up rage. With the benefit of hindsight, the American and French Revolutions are obvious to us. But in real-time, they weren't. It's very hard to interpret the society you're living in. It's not like the nobles wanted to have their heads chopped off.

So, to interpret our society better we need a tool. And that's our Life Star. It will give extras better rules to follow, because their rooted in Nature. Like a telescope or microscope replaced human made rules about the Universe and Nautre, the Life Star will replace the human made rules, with answers rooted in Nature and empower us to see and understand our society better.

The Life Star starts by learning the power of stories.

### Storytelling Indicators

Here's why stories increase our insight into our society.

A story is a protagonist fighting to solve a problem an antagonist defends. They fight in three parts. The first is an introduction to the problem and characters. The second is the battle between good and bad sides. The third part is the conclusoin, where we find out which side wins.

In good storytelling, be it fantasy, romance, or comedy, the sequence of events must be unexpected enough to be interesting, yet logical enough to be believable. Balancing the two is the art of good storytelling because it makes audiences wonder, care, but comprehend, what's going to happen next.

So, stories surprise us, but at the same time, they need to be logical. That means every story element needs a reason to exist, even if we don’t initially understand it. And here’s the connection with Techvolution and our Life Star. Because understanding all the reasoning hidden in stories, helps us understand all the reasoning hidden in our society.

Because we solve problems with new tools. Inventing, and distributing new tools is a story. Invention is fueld by genius, distribution by majic, and both fight antagonists to be created. To master these stories, we have to fully understand stories.

Stories are valuable because they explain why humans act the way we do. The human subconscious will always try to find meaning to any series of events, be it a movie, or a life. The conscious mind will always perceive a series of events. Thus, if a story is logical story, an audiences unconsicous and conscious minds are in alignment, a link develops between the story, and the viewer. When a story isn't logical, is a bad story, it requires bullshit to keep the audience engage. Like how modern blockbuster movies pour on more special effects and stars. The stories suck, but the audience is distracted with the spectacle of explosions, sex, gore porn, and celebreties.

This same thing happens in human societys. When society's story is logical, people inside will function without too much oversight. When however society is non-functioning, spectacle is used to distract the people, and rules are used to keep them in line.

Now, we have to breakdown stories, so we can later make the Life Star.

### Story Parts

Aristotle dissected stories in Poetics. He teaches us all their parts, which are listed below. From the least to the most important.

Items: are the props, of the story. Broom sticks, magic hats, houses. Put them all together and items make the setting, like ancient Rome, galactic space, or suburan American. The items are like the veil. To understand society, means to be able to tell why the items are the way they are.

Passion: Items come alive when somebody gives them passion. The American flag, wedding rings, Nobel prizes. Just items, until someone feels passion about them. People promote and defend their passions in their dialogue.

Dialogue: is the powerful words, whether written of spoken, between characters fighting for their passions. Like Douglass learning to read, and Hugh telling Sophia teaching a slave to read is bad. Dialogue is authority. Because once an idea is spoken, it can spread and become political. Tyrants start by burning books, and controlling the free speech. Change happens first in dialogue. Like Rousseau, who was only dangerous because he wrote good dialogue, to topple the antagonists to change.

Antagonist: defends the society against changes. They use items, passions, and dialogue to do it. However, since an antagonist defends society, he is a servant of, and thus bound by the society's ruling philosophy.

Ruling philosphy: is the philosophy that sets society's rules. Like the "Dark Side" controlling the empire in _Star Wars_, the machines controlling _The Matrix_, or the evil step-family controlling Cinderella. The ruling philosophy isn't created in the story. It already exists. Inside this cave is the reality most people live inside. The ruling philosophy so powerful it controls anyone not a protagonist.

Protagonist: the rulebreakers who see a problem with the ruling philosophy, and fight to replace it with a new one, like Luke Skywalker, Neo, Cinderella. Only protagonists can rise above the ruling philosophy. That's why the protagonist is the story's leader. Their success determines if society will change or not.

Plot: the series of battles between protagonist and antagonist. Usually the plot, and the battles, is about a tool whose creation, or destruction, determines the winner of the story. The Death Star, matrix, and glass slipper, are all tools. Whoever controls them, is the winner of the story.

![Argh](\../img\thewriter\triangle-office-space.png)
**Office Space:**  Hits close to home, the story about the boring drugery of modern suburban life and office work. The ruling philosophy is commercialism that gives workers repetitive tasks and keeps them in line with absurd office culture and just enough money to pay their bills. The antagonist is the boss who gets a disproportionate amount of money, prestige, and power.

The protagonist is the guy who values his freedom more then money. The plot rests on whether the protagonist will control the tool, money, to free himself from having to work anymore.

### Charting Stories

What does a healthy story, its events, philosophies, characters, and items, work together.

Here's a legend.

![Legend](\../img\thewriter\story-legend.png)

**Old Society** - The society before the story starts.
**Beginning** - When the protagonist breaks from society.
**Protagonist philosophy** - The good guy acts out his philosophy.
**Antagonist philosophy** -  The bad guy acts out his philosophy.
**Realizations** -  Moments when a character realizes something.
**Suffering of the Protagonist** - Long periods when the protagonists suffers.
**Reversal of Situations** - When the plot changes big time.
**Free will** - The time character's have to act. Small spread is grave danger, big is nothing matters.
**Conclusion** - The final battle.
**New Society** - The result of the battle.

This is the how story's look like. We'll map out the fight over new tools soon. First we have to see the three difference kinds of stories we'll encounter.

### Three Kings of Stories

There are three kinds of stories. One that works, and two that don't for different reasons.

![Functional Story](\../img\thewriter\story-functional.png)
*Functional:* Story parts are well ordered. The story is about an explicit problem. The protagonist wants to change something, and the antagonist doesn't. Both have passion, making them a believable person. As protagonist and antagonist battle, they make a logical yet surprising plot.

The stories problems are logical, and thus the character has time to figure them out. Because it's a functional story the audience cares about the story and its characters. Ex. Cinderella, Shawshank Redemption, Star Wars, Pixar, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, etc.

![Art Story](\../img\thewriter\story-art.png)
**Art:** Story elements are disordered. Character are are emphasized over plot. The story doesn't have an explicit problem. Thus, art stories emphasize character's selfish passions, and are less stories than personal diaries about loves, hobbies, and interests.

Since there is no battle between protagonist and antagonist, the plot is often illogical and inconsequential to outsiders. The separation between plot and character is wide because noting is at stake. The conclusion doesn't change the original reality very much. Ex. "The Cinema", Snow Angels, Wrecked, Spanglish, many Sundance, and TIFF films, etc.

![Spectacle Story](\../img\thewriter\story-spectacle.png)
**Spectacle:** Story elements are disordered. The story is about an obvious problem like the world is ending. Because the problem is so simple, neither the protagonist or antagonist has much character. The divide between character and plot is small.

Spectacle stories emphasize items and effects. The story is about how the protagonist wins, not if. Spectacle is like learning a new toy. It's about having fun with no purpose in mind. Ex. Transformers 1-8, Star Wars 1-3 / 7-9, most sequels and remakes.

**Conclusion:** Art stories don't have a real beginning. Since they aren't about a specific problem they could start at any moment. Spectacle stories have a beginning but are about fighting for survival and not fighting for a new reality. Only functional stories have real beginnings. Because functional stories have a protagonist fighting to replace a reality with their own.

Likewise, only functional stories have conclusions. Conclusions require mixing two proposed realities and making a new one. Conclusions are also where plot and character share importance. Because at the conclusion the characters actions are so important, they directly affect the plot.

![After the story ends](\../img/thewriter/distribution-star_wars.png)

And this is the important part. When any story ends, all story elements, all characters, all items and thoughts, return to being equal. Because the plot that bound them is over, and thus each waits for a new story to give them life and purpose, and give anyone the chance to be the new hero.

For example, in _Star Wars_ Once the Death Star is blown up, Light Side defeated the Dark side. Thus, Luke is no longer the protagonist, Vader isn't the antagonist, dialogue isn't controlled by the need to destroy/save the Death Star, passions can follow something else, and items are just things again. The hierarchy becomes a circle in a time of equality.

Importantly, since spectacle and art stories don't have stories, they can't have conclusions. So they continue growing indefinitely. Thus art is followed with more art, and spectacle is followed with more spectacle. They never end.

Until people inside reality realize the divine nobles bankrupted their entire society.

### Small example

Taking what we've learned about story elements, and the three kinds of stories, let's look back at what we've learned about the creation and distribution of new tools.

Spectacle is how tools are first made. Basically we toy with new technology, trying to figure out what it can do. Spectacle works best here because it's easy and cheap. For example, pornography was one of the first book topics printed, and online pornography quickly spread on the early world wide web.

After toying around, we learn what the tool is capable of, and start applying it to real world problems. Here a new tool enters the functional stage. Where protagonists question society, and continually break the rules to push society forward.

Then comes the third stage, art and spectacle. A new tool only has so much problem it can solve. After Charles Martel and Charlemagne built the castles, standing army, and judges, that returned peace and order to western Europe. This was the functional stage of history.

Naturally, once civilization returned to Europe, its members should have returned to being equals. Yet, since they didn't have Techvolution, Europe waited for a revolution to return equality. In the meantime, the story becaome a mixture of art and spectacle. The nobles lived a art story, one based on fueling their selfishness with expensive props. And spectacle, used to distract the people from the the non-functioning story.

![After the story ends](\../img\thewriter\techvolution-story-types-applied.png)

And this moment in the human story, is what Techvolution is designed to overcome. When we identity the problem our society is meant to overcome, we can have more funtional stories about overcoming problems, and less art stories about spending money one ourselves.

And that's what Rousseau noticed. That society was past due its moment of conclusion. That instead of protagonists becoming equal again, and distributing the proceeds of a new tool throughout society, the leaders descendants kept it for themselves.

### Ruling Philosophy Seen By Jedi's

That means we today are living in a art and spectacle story. Art is what the establishment enjoys, palaces and banquests and balls. The extras are bombareded with spectacle, to distract from tools that aren't up to date with the recent problems, but are made fancier instead.

Duplication...?

Like any story, our ruling philosophy should have a goal. With goals come a natural conclusion. Protagonists are heroes because they set to overcome's the stories problem, and therefore become special, or divine.

However, in stories when the problem is overcome, the hero returns to being a regular person. Unfortunately, people took the nobles divine right to rule literally. Stuck inside their ruling philosophy, the nobles were protagonsits in their eyes, while being "Darth Kings" to history.

Similarly, on ruling philosophy as no conclusion built in. Ask any Darth Blockbuster you want, managing partner at a consultanting firm, high priced lawyer, music executive, Professor of Distinguished Chair of Media Studies, when they will return to being equal. They won't even know what the fuck you're talking about. They're divine!

They use art and spectacle to hide their dysfunction. Real heroes want to end the fight, and return home to their friends and families. They don't want the praise, they want to overcome the problem.

  . Perpetual functional story. Techvolution is the perpetual functional story. Because people are free to choose their own tools, and thus can solve their own problems. They can't live in art/spectacle, inside an ecosystem.

### Natural Indicators

In ecosystems, lifeforms excesses are checked by the food chain. Which is good, because balanced and flowing resources means all lifeforms live, probe, and adapt to problems. Europe's nobility was hoarding resources, this alone is a clear indication their ruling philosophy, and its rules, was past its usefulness. It was contrary to Nature.

We can see the same problem in more details when we analyze stories.

## The Death Star

Midway through _Star Wars_, the ship taking Skywalker, Obi-Wan, Leia, and Solo is captured by the very ship the secret plans were stolen to destroy. It's great writing, because, they have to escape it, so they can destroy it.

Well I hope you took notes Skywalker. Because they got me! The antagonists have me in a Darth Blockbuster choke hold. And I'm in trouble.

See, I broke the rules and they sent their stormtroopers. I was over powered. Not by superior reasoning, philosophy, or ethics. No, they over powered me because some extras joined them! I'm here, like Rapunzel, trapped in the Death Star, under the watch of extras. You have to the secret plans to the rule book. And now have to use them, in order to free me. I'm being well treated and feed, other than being forced to listen to red / blue cable news. Can you convince the extras I'm a good guy? Can you save me?

Oh what did I do? I downloaded a movie from the pirate bay.

Hurry up! Blue / red cable news is showing protesters flying into a Climate Change Strike. I don't know how much longer I got, nevermind the polar bears. Although I think the bears will realize the stupidity before the bristol boards with thousands of air miles do. Help!

### Skywalker Turns on His Lightsaber

Fucking Obi-Wan. How'd he get caught? Caught, I didn't even know they were chasing us. Shit's getting serious. Or shit always is. He'd saying something like that.

So he broke the rules, and the extras agreed, and now he's trapped, and I have to get him out.

Or better put, he broke their rules, and watched a digital movie. The first step is intelligence. Let's go on YouTube and see what we can find on Darth Blockbuster.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r1mLa9Gk4Ow" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

An official reporter, talking to valued executives and altruistic artists about a problem they say is hurting society. At least that's how some extras saw these peoples, and thus they turned on Obi-Wan. Well many extras were downloading too, but despite that, it was against the rules. Okay, so we got the basics. Lets use Techvolution, to change all the extras minds.

### Technological History of the Movies

It's funny how going to YouTube solved my problem so quickly. Now, I need to know how movies and television technologically evolved. This would take weeks at a library. But I have Wikipedia so it'll take a few hours. Rubbish indeed professors.

So let's free Obi-Wan.

The first thing to understand, is movies didn't invent stories. We've always told stories and always will. They help us understand our lives and societies. Religious sermons, epic poetry, and stage plays have filled our need of stories throughout the years.

The movies, and later television, are merely tools that help tell stories. Each is merely a creation of three pieces of technology. Data transmission, data storage, and data viewing. Movies started in 1894 when Thomas Edison's laboratory invented the kinetoscope; the first machine that moved pictures through a light source fast enough to give the impression of seamless movement. Hence the name "moving pictures", simplified as "movies".

The kinetoscope was like a vending machine for movies. Customers looked through a peep hole to see clips of boxing matches or dance routines. It was a popular noveltly, kinda like GIFs on Instagram. Edison owned the patents, and created the New Jersey based Motion Picture Patent Corporation (MPPC) to make sure everyone in the young movie industry paid their dues.

After a few years MPPC's interference and legal threats, in what amounted to shakedowns, movie companies moved to Los Angeles to get away. And as new projector technology came, MPPC lost its patent monopoly anyway, and the movie industry was free to grow in LA's good weather, cheap land, and no stiffling corporate hierachies.

Technology kept improving. New projectors could show movies on huge screens. Although reels weren't long enough yet to show long movies. With the new projectors, movie theaters called Nickelodeons (because admission cost a nickel) opened up across the country. The movies were still novelties, showing exotic animal, news reels, or sports highlights.

By the 1920's film reels were long enough to show three act stories. Sound still wasn't synched with film. Instead movies spoke dialogue with subtitles and theatres used live music bands, to communicate plot points.

In 1927 film was finally synchronized with sound, giving movies dialogue and music. For the first time in history, full stories were not limited to a physical theatre. Any movie theatre in the world could show any story. A new storytelling tool was thus created.

The people certainly felt movie majic. The movies attracted millions every week. American industry rushed to control the booming industry. American culture was slowly told on the silver screen. Leading actors became cultural icons. The industry exploded with profits. Although the people controlled none of it, their interest and loyalty made it happen one movie ticket at a time

Of course, all the technology that made the movi eindustry so rich and powerful was physical. Data storage, transport, and viewing was physical film, light projectors, and delivery trucks.

This didn't change until a new tool was born in 1948. Televisions used a different mixture of technologies. Huge magnetic tape reels stored content. Radio transmitted content over the airwaves. And televisions recieved the transmissions and displayed the content on tube televisions.

Broadcasts television companies like NBC, ABC, and CBS, now competed with movie theatres. Story quality wasn't as good, but the convenience was huge. Especially as Americans slowly moved away from the cities packed with movie theatres, into the suburbs packed with TV's.

From the 1950's to the early 1980's nothing much changed in the entertainment industry. Movies and television got better technologies. Film reels got clearer, color, and widescreen. Likewise, televisions got bigger and bandwidth improved with cable. But no new tools were created. The people still couldn't choose or produce their own content.

Then came new tools. The magentic tapes the broadcasters stored their content on got small enough to make Video Cassette Recorder. VCR's cut out the broadcaster, who of course sued Sony for letting people break the rules and "time shift" television shows. The case ended up in the Supreme Court in 1984.

In a 5-4 vote, the extras were free to add the VCR to their cyborgology. The power to record and watch videos was distributed to the people. Of course VCR, home cameras, and renting movies became very popular. The most successful video rental company took the name "Blockbuster; the common term for popular movies. The entertainment industry forgot about its objections, and gladly put its content on Blockbuster's busy shelves.

Home entertainment kept getting better. Soon came DVD's and flatscreen televisions. DVD's were more advanced CD's, and worked similar to videotapes, except they were digital. Meaning data was stored as "1 or 0". Plasma or LCD flatscreens televisions were much bigger then tube televisions, and since they were digital too, they were High Definition.

Even more people rushed to upgrade their cyborgology with DVD's and home theatres. Blockbuster rental stores were even more packed. And people started buying hundreds of DVD's for home libraries. The entertainmetn industry loved it. They didn't even care movie theatre attendence dropped heavily. In fact, they used theatres as marketing hype. The money was in DVD sales.

Although movie theatres kept going bankrupt, the record entertainment industry profits were huge, so they loved DVDs. Yet the data transmission, data storage, and data viewing technologies that made movies, were now almost entirely digital.

Except movie distribution. People still had to drive to pick up their DVD's or less likely go to the theatre. Hence, people still needed to concentrate around movie theatres, rental stores, or TV guides, i.e. the castles with gatekeepers, to acccess their digital data.

Until they didn't.

The internet, the transfer of digital information that was used for email and webpages since the 1970's, had kept getting better and faster. And in the early 2000's the internet got High Speed, and could finally transfer enough 1's and 0's of a DVD faster then someone driving to pick one up.

And here enters places like The Pirate Bay. Like Napster, it introduced digital movies to people first. Altough the entertainment industry used digital camera's, film projectors, email, webpages, YouTube, they wanted the people to keep using DVD's, they even made new ones called Blu-Ray and HD-DVD.

The people wanted the better tool. Pirate Bay was the first to offer it. It was a pain, it was hard to learn, but it was better than driving.

Pirates you might say! People are evil, people are lazy, people are thieves! Really? Then explain the graph below, the one what shows how the evil people responded with protagonist Reed Hastings made a new tool, and distributed its powers to the people. What we call Netflix.

If middle class Americans, Canadians are pirates, why didn't Blockbuster stores have steal bars? The same reason why we don't steal Netflix. Blockbuster was a fair deal, until data streaming was possible. Then Netflix was.

The people elected to download movies from pirate bay or because it was a upgrade available to their cyborgology. The only natural rule is natural selection. The people choose the best tool because with new majic, they evole into better cyborgs. It's not the people's job to wait for an industry to catch up to nature. But the other way around.

Maybe the industry would have noticed that, if they weren't so busy at so many movie premieres, talk shows, award shows, and launch parties. The Oscars, Correspondence Dinners, Emmy's, Golden Globes, Cannes Film Festival, Sundance Film Festival, Toronto International Film Festival, and so many others. All modern version of banquets and balls, with gates to keep you out, and rules put in place to make the good times of the DVD going. Party loving, profit loving, foresight lacking is a recipe for antagonism, hence Darth Blockbuster rose up.

Digital tools empowered the extras to fight back, and check his selfishness. Techvolution tells them its right to do it. As for it being against the rules, it was, and maybe it should be, but do you think Darth Blockbuster will buy back all those DVDs, Blu-Rays, and HD-DVDs he said was better then illegal downloading?

He won't. Because while Darth Blockbuster expects people to follow his rule book, he follows nature's, and doesn't use bad tools himself.

### Decision Time

Well extras, stormtroopers, that's your master. He's a Sith Lord. While he may be a great person, nice to you and his employees, wears nice clothing, tips well, whoever he is doesn't matter. He is an antagonist to society. He fought against video tapes, then jumped on board when they made him money. He fought against interet songs, then jumped on board. Fought against internet streaming, then jumped on board.

What's going to happen when 3D printing threatens his merchandising. Or when Virtual Reality let's people live their own stories. Or whatever! We shouldn't have to argue for new tools! You fight him, or are his Stormtrooper, because you decide the winner between protagonist and antagonist!

Let Obi-Wan go!

No, we can't work with him. You can't stand in the middle. Pick a side.

## A Hopeless Fight, A Sure Victory

Can't make up your mind. This will help. Digital tools are strong. The force is strong with whoever holds it. And that is not by accident. It's by design. The thousands of protagonists who built digital tools like wanted to decentralize power. For the interent, they built it in from the start. And this fact means Darth Blockbuster never did, and never will, stand a chance against today's internet Jedi.

### Protagonist Paul Baran

The internet has many protagonists. Paul Baran is one of the big ones. Here's why.

The internet is a network. There are many ways of sending data through a network. The simplest is how phone systems do it, with a direct circuit link between two phones. A call's connection only stops when someone hangs up.

Alexander Graham Bell invented "direct circuit links" in 1876 and put it into action when he co-founded the American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T) in 1885. For generations direct links was how all telecommunications worked. But when the Soviets tested a hydrogen bomb in 1955, Paul Baran took it upon himself to make a new tool to help prevent a nuclear holocaust.

Baran realized to prevent nuclear war, the world needed a communications network that would survive an atomic attack. Only robust and reliable communications would ease American and Soviet trigger fingers during tense times.

Baran worked alone for years. By 1960 he came up with the two ideas he needed. The first was that his network should have no hubs or organizations (like telephone's have) to control the flow of information. Central hubs make systems vulerable to attack or failure. Instead data flow should be completely distributed so every node can send and receive information. Baran's equal nodes network looks like a fishnet. Each node only needs three or four links to survive any attack.

Next Baran had to figure out how to send information across the network. This led to his second idea, which was to break up the data into standard-size little packets. Each message would be broken into many of packets, each of which would scurry along different paths through the network’s nodes and be reassembled when they got to their destination. If one packet didn't get there in time, it wasresent. This way there'd be no "dropped calls" and communication would always stay open. Baran published his ideas into detailed technical specs and made sure everyone, especially the Soviets, could copy his work.

Baran then walked into a nest of villians. When Baran's employer RAND recommended his "node-packet data network" idea to the Air Force (in control of America's nuclear missles) they wanted to build it. But when the Department of Defense got itself and the Defense Communications Agency involved Baran soon found out working with so many bureaucrats was hopeless.

So Baran tried to convince AT&T, in control of America's telephone network, to supplement their system with his node-packet data network. “They fought it tooth and nail,” he recalled. “They tried all sorts of things to stop it.” They would not even let RAND use the maps of its circuits, so Baran had to use a leaked set. He made several trips to AT&T headquarters in lower Manhattan. On one of them, a senior executive who was an old engineer looked stunned when Baran explained that his system would mean that data could go back and forth without a dedicated link remaining open. “He looked at his colleagues in the room while his eyeballs rolled up sending a signal of his utter disbelief,” according to Baran. After a pause, the executive said, “Son, here’s how a telephone works,” and explained a patronizing and simplistic description.

The Sith's metaphorical Death Star became real. It was against the rules to make a reliable communication network that might help prevent a nuclear holocaust. Good thing Jedi's don't give up. Baran continued to push. AT&T finally had him and other outsiders to a series of seminars explaining how its telephone system really worked. “It took ninety-four separate speakers to describe the entire system,” Baran marveled. When it was over, the AT&T executives asked Baran, “Now do you see why packet switching wouldn’t work?” To their great disappointment, Baran simply replied, “No.”

To heck with Darth Telephone!

A decade later Baran's network was built when the US government's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) saw the wisdom in a node-packet distrbuted communications network. In 1969 ARPA used Baran's technical specs to build ARPAnet, the first version of the our internet.

Baran's network is why our internet, smartphones, apps always empower individuals. In the DNA of the interent is a distributed node network that nobody can control or shutdown. An individual has the exact same access as any corporation or government.

That's why the internet is majical. Whoever uses it, is automatically empowered. It's why Darth Blockbuster never had a chance. And never will. Remeber after someone else built the internet, AT&T prevented regular Americans from using it by having modems banned. The entertainment industry sued VCR's, digital songs, digital movies. They always lost, because their Death Star of rules, will always lose to the internet, it's the basis of humanity's Life Star.

At Now please tell me, why Darth Blockbuster is so moral and just, the he deserves to hold back digital tools. Techvolution is to be the first explicit philosophy of the internet and other new tools. It's a phiilosophy to distribute the power of new tools, because our new tools were made to distribute power. So let Obi-Wan go!

_Paul Baran's and Crocker's story was adapted from Walter Isaacson's awesome book_ The Innovators, _Chapter 7._
  
## King's Choice

### Place in Line

When Rousseau was being chased around Europe, King Louis XVI rule France and King George III ruled England. Both faced revolutions inspired by the pain on the frontline their mismanagement of government, its finances caused. However, these weren't the first kings to face revolts.

Before Rousseau explain frontline problems to the people. The people still rose up against noble's excesses and incompetent leadership. Without Rousseau's new philosophy they used Christian theology. Among the first to face the people's wrath was King Charles I, who ruled England from 1625-1649.

Charles ruled as an absolute monarch under the "nobles right to rule" ruling philosophy. England had a Parliament but it was supposed to advise the king, not tell him what to do. After some revolts in the Middle Ages, parliament did however earn the power to approve taxes.

After years of past monarchs mismanaging government finances, and Charles overspending himself, he needed money. Parliament refused to say yes until it got more powers. Charles refused to talk. Instead he sent parliament home, and ruled by himself for 10 years. He raised taxes using some very old feudal tithes and rules. One retroactively fined some men for not showing up to Charles' coronation 10 years earlier. Their version of not reading the fine print.

Parliament eventually got sick of this subversion, raised an army of fervent Christians, and fought the English Civil War (1642–1646). These army was local men, whose officers were chosen by merit. Charles men were mostly nobles who hired mercenaries to fight for them. The war was bad. It inspired the saying that life without a working government is "nasty, brutish, and short".

Charles lost. He was held under arrest, while rules for a "constituional monarchy" were being made by the Parliamentarians. Charles escaped. Hired a new army, and fought the Second English Civil War (1648–1649).

Charles lost again. Parliment was enraged. They fervent Christians forgot about a constitutional monarch, and charged Charles for crimes against the English people. Quite a novel idea at the time. But even if they didn't have Rousseau's philosophy yet, the people were still empowered by guns, books, and scientific instruments to start to think for themselves. While they didn't have a new ruling philosophy, the people were at least questioning the one in power.

Charles didn't budge. He was the descedant of 1,000 years of noble blood. He was the natural leader the same way a father is the leader of his children. Charles refused to speak to the court because a father doesn't answer to his children. But then Charles did speak, and that fact, showcases how set the Sith are in their stories.

### Charles Speaks

Charles had a speech impediment. Often called a stammer or studder. No one then, or even now, understands what causes it. It's annoying to listen to. Like your speaker wire is frayed, and the music is choppy.

That's because talking with a stutter is like playing guitar with music notes written on the fly by a gremlin. Some words are easy to say, some are ~~difficult~~ hard, and some decide which at the last mili-mili-mili-second. The stutterer has to jump around the words in real time. Fail and you miss a --- beat.

But a stutter isn't just pauses. Stuttering is like getting hit with a stun gun or having a mini-seizure. You're body seizes. Your neck tenses. You stop breathing. It's horrible. And it can happen every fourth word.

The physical pain isn't even the worst. Getting _that_ look from people is. The "what the fuck is wrong with you?" look.

Hello, my ~~name~~ I go by John-ne. I wa-want ~~can~~ want to help ~~master~~ human evol-ution. I've been ~~writ~~ trying to write this book for ~~about~~ ah ~~five~~...

The prospect of talking, except to yourself and a dog, which Charles had two of, causes huge anxiety. The idea of never conversing with anyone causes huge loneliness and depression. _The King's Speech_ showed it well. Stuttering usually forces a person to be shy, passive, eager to please, and come up with weired reasons for their erratic speaking like hand gestures, random silence, binge drinking, and swear words (which for some reason never cause a stutter). It's entirely possible King Charles' relationship with Parliament was so bad because he simply didn't want to talk with them. Not that he would ever admit he had a impediment. After all, he was a king!

I know this all because luckily enough (kidding) I have the same affliction as Charles. It was the reason I got a job in a car insurance claim department. After a vice president at an old company secretly told my supervisor I wasn't allowed to talk to customers, for fear of embarrasing the company, I was like shit I guess I don't have this damn gremlin under control. I wasn't even that mad about it (although I was that it was an open secret for over a year). I never told anyone I had the impediment, so despite therapy as a kid, it was obviously still a problem.

So fuck it. I decided to jump in the pool and sink or swim. A car insurance claim call-centre is like climbing Mount Everest for a stutterer. A daily workout of all day phone calls, angry drivers, customer service expectations, no "outs" like swear words, booze, or wonky behavior to hide behind.

And it was far worse then I thought. The insurance company wanted adjusters to answer ever more phone calls. To incentize us, they'd ring a monotone "bell" because... I don't know. They never said why, we employees learned questioning "the bell" was a bad idea. Management used it as punishment; "answer more phone calls or we'll make the bell faster and louder!".

I'm being serious by the way. We were often more stressed then the person who just had a car crash. Whatever the reason, DING-DING-DING-DING almost all day, which gave people who weren't stutterers huge anxiety, breakdowns, and stress leaves.

Super-shock speech therapy! After about a year I didn't have to massage my jaws at night to release it from all the teeth shattering jaw-clenches I did to divert vocal stuttering. I was cured!

The point is this. That's what it took for me to mostly, except when pretenious cultures limit my word choices, never stutter. It's like night and day. The anxiety washed away the more pitch perfect things I said. A hidden outgoing personality was brought out and frankly is fun, although still surreal, to be.

Yet Charles never had this lesson. In addition to being arrogant about his nobility, he was famoulsy shy, and quiet his whole life because the gremlin likes it that way. Even when fighting for 16 years defending his ruling philosophy, Charles still probably had to massage his strained jaws every night. I can sympathize. The gremlin is a bully.

At Charles trial, a Christian king, faced a Christian uprising. However, while the soldiers were inspired by sermons from the Bible, Charles was accused of being "a Tyrant, A Traitor, Murderer, and a public enemy to the Commonwealth of England". Not a bad Christian king, but a bad ruler. The people of England, empowered with many books, scientific instruments, and especially guns of a healthy civilization, were firing their leader. A novel ideal at the time.

The prosecutors didn't have Rousseau's new ruling philosophy to explain their dreams of a fairer society. They simple said Charles didn't have a "divine right to rule" and asked for the death penalty. Charles wouldn't even acknowledge the trial. He didn't believe his life was on the chopping block. Kings don't answer to children.

Charles wasn't pretending or bluffing. He wasn't proud, or stubborn. He psychologically couldn't understand even the idea of being wrong. He lived in a different story with a different ruling philosophy. One that made him the protagonist.

The judges convicted Charles anyway. He was sentenced to death by removing the head from the body. Charles was flabbergasted. He finally spoke in his defense at the execution. Fuck the ringing bell of a claims department, Charles only had words to justify himself to his (supposed) subjects, and to history. And... and... no stutter. Not once!

Charles freely, openely, spoke the music of his mind.

He didn't just speak, he spoke so eloquently many people, even those who hated him, were impressed. He spoke so well, so clearly, people heard no gremlin! Fuck... I'm happy for him. It must have felt like God killed the gremlin. Indeed Charles's last words were a clearly spoken:

> Truly I desire their (the people’s) liberty and freedom as much as anybody whomsoever; but I must tell you their liberty and freedom consist in having of government, those laws by which their life and their goods may be most their own. It is not for having a share in government, Sir, that is nothing pertaining to them. A subject and a ruler are clear different things...therefore I tell you that I am the Martyr of the people. I die a Christian according to the profession of the Church of England, as I found it left me by my father... I have a good Cause and I have a gracious God. I will say no more.

Clealr spoken words about being behind the times. Kings were no longer needed. The people could rule themselves. Charles should have been happy his children grew up. Instead he used their money to hire foreigners to kill them.

Charles was merely defending the rules as defined by the ruling philosophy. Despite massive government debt, a restless population, and many chances for compromise, he didn't want to fix frontline problems, but protect the rules. He was an antagonist. The extras followed the protagonists, reached for new tools, fought and won their empowerment.

Later kings still didn't learn. Even more distanced from the frontline inside their palaces, banquets and balls, their heads filled with gremlins that said the rules are just, good, and will never end. France, Spain, Russia had country wide banktrupcies, food shortages, and revolutions, and it didn't matter. The ultimate gremlin is isolation from the frontline. Many more Darth Kings faced the chopping block with the voice of God calling them martyrs.

So do you still think Darth Blockbuster will to let Obi-Wan go?

### Walking On Eggshells

The battle scene. I face Darth Blockbuster. He stares back with hate. I'm still bound. He could strike me down. Instead he lifts his finger, and my cuffs release.

My lightsabre is on a table. I grab it. Turn it on. He does too. The light of both hum together, a nice tune, that foretells violence.

Why didn't he strike me down. He wants to prove something. He needs people to follow his rules, and no better way than for them to see him the hero, and his rules as just. Hero's don't murder, they avenge wrong doing.

So I fight the Sith lord. We jump up and down. Slice left and right. Slash, kick, we're both beating the other bloody. Nothing divides our powers. Neither is reaching for salvation. We both have the same tools. And that's been the problem all along Skywalker.

I mentioned this several times, but never pointed it out. This battle between protagonists and antagonists is ages old. It was fought when we invented swords, bows and arrows, the printing press, muskets, and telescopes. Like clockwork, the Sith fight to retain power, the Jedi fight to distribute it. When the former wins, the people's cyborgology stays dependant. If the latter wins, the people upgrade their powers to solve frontline problems on their own terms.

Machiavelli, Galileo, John Locke, Oliver Cromwell, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, George Washington, Frederick Douglas and so many other great people have fought it. Yet the Sith keep coming back because the Sith win every battle by default. They have society's rulebook. And while the protagonists keep making new tools and fighting to spread their powers, the majic the extras fell is so often to faint in comparison to the Sith's Death Star at work, home.

The Sith's frequent victories mean the line between old and imagined new societies gets wide. These wider lines represent increasingly different realities. Officially, we follow the Sith's rules out of fear of his Death Star. Yet evolution stops for no one. Thus, humanity still dreams and works towards distributing the power of new tools. Old and new society's co-exist, but increasingly diverge.

When someone has their own version of reality, we call it a mental illness. Dealing with this person is said to be like "walking on eggshells", because it's very hard to socialize with a unique version of right and wrong. The lesson is when Techvolution is held back, and society gets more out of whack, the Sith and Jedi are walking on egg shells with each other. Compromise is impossible.

Wide lines brings more violent battle scenes like civil wars and revolutions. Human technological evolution thus happens in jumps. Techvolution only works when we all seeminglessly drop bad tools for new ones.

Thus, it was never my goal to defeat _this_ Death Star. Destroy one and like in the _Star Wars_ movies the Sith just make another one. The real reason Darth Blockbuster let me go, because even if I strike him down and Techvolution becomes a ruling philosophy, another Darth will return and corrupt society's rule book again. In the past, whenever the Death Star is destroyed by a new tool, a new heirachy forms around it. And when human technological evolution surpasses these tools, the Sith have formed around it, and made a new Death Star to protect their power and keep and keep their supposed children on the bottom.

Obi-Wan knows, for as long as the hierarchies exists, killing one king, only lets another take his place.

The Death Star is a tool, a corrupt rule book that keeps new tools down, and the extras distracted from their natural Techvolution. But it's a tool nonetheless. Thus, we can fight the Sith for eternity trying to keep it clean, and out of majic's way. But society doesn't have time to hold our breath hoping the good guys desires, opinions, or rules, win. Every story is decided by which character holds the tools.

To truly learn the lesson we must create a tool that replaces the Death Star. One that continually enforces our natural evolution. Where the only rule is natural selection. Otherwise, a short time from now, in a society not to far away, another Johnny Majic will be told his simple new tool is against the rules.

That's what I wanted to teach you. To use the battles of good and evil in history, to understand Techvolution, to not only make it a ruling philosophy, but to make a tool that will keep it in power and forever kill the Sith.

And only the extras can build it. The protagonists can help, but must stay out of the battle. Only the majic of many extras can defend against a corrupted rule book. And now that job is to you Skywalker. I look at you and see not the kid asking about the rebellion of the mind, but the kid who will forever win the rebellion against the Death Star with our very own Life Star.

So I lift my sword, and smile. I smile at eternal rest. Because the Jedi will no longer face down the Sith. It's your job. So I raise my sword, and Darth Blockbuster strikes me down as I know you'll learn the lesson. The person who holds the tools wins.
