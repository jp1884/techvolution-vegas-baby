# INTRODUCTION

## Freeing Cinderella

“Extras are born free; and everywhere they are in chains.” Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote that in 1762. He was the King of France. No he wasn’t. He was the richest man in England. Nope. Rousseau was a poor writer who copied sheets of music to make the rent. More than 300 years later, he is recognized as being a great philosopher, a political visionary, and a protagonist who helped free the world with his new philosophy.

Rousseau lived when kings and queens, dukes and duchesses ruled civilization. A time when Mozart played inside exquisite palaces during the nobility's many banquets and balls. This was the image of opulence that had Cinderella dreaming her days away as she cleaned a dirty chateau. Sadly, unlike the the fairy tale, the extras didn't have a fairy Godmother to make dreams come true. Instead, commoners cleaned noble's vast libraries, used guns while dying in their wars, and wondered what it looked like through a telescope. The extras were excluded from the power of new tools because they believed their beloved Holy Bible said only noble people had the "divine right to rule".

Rousseau called bullshit. In truth, Jesus was a carpenter, and books, guns, and scientific instruments should liberate the extras who were only in chains for the happiness of con artists. The self-proclaimed “divine nobility” didn’t like hearing that. This powerful self-protecting community of Darth Kings declared Rousseau a banquet-pooper, and chased him out of Switzerland, France, and England. Maybe that’s why Rousseau rented instead of owned.

Starting in 1776, within Rousseau’s lifetime, Darth King started to face the music, when the American people started a revolution. One year after he died, the French had one too in 1789. And on it went from country to country because Rousseau, and others like him, discovered the magic words for extras to realize they should become protagonists in a civilization “of the people, for the people, by the people”. Cinderella soon forgot about the fancy ball, and instead played the music of freedom, in a choir of equals that sounded something like this:

>Do you hear the people sing?
Singing a song of angry men?
It is the music of a people
Who will not be slaves again
When the beating of your heart
Echo’s the beating of the drums
There is a life about to start
When tomorrow comes!

Revolutionary songs like this spread the people’s liberty, equality and fraternity throughout the world. In a few years, civilization changed its philosphy from _knowing_ the nobles were divine, to _knowing_ they were villians. When the people took control of books, guns, and science, they put presidents and senators, judges and sherriffs in power, who rulled at the request new protagonists who built a civilization with checks and balances, because no one was divine. A change empowered by tools, thought of in philosophy, yet made real with the bloodshed of revolutions.

Rousseau died never having found a home. After they won their revolutions, a population of heroes put him to rest inside the glorious Panthéon; as a renowned breaker of chains, in a free world he helped build. Where any guy can be the prince, and any girl can be Cinderella.

## The Realm of Human Understanding

How did Rousseau do it? He changed the ruling philosophy. He had to use revolution, a sudden questioning of a civilization’s ruling philosophy. Yet he did it all with words.

First let's just say, the nobility are the gatekeepers of the ruling philosophy, but not necessarily are they Darth Blockbusters. They are group of people who share a mix of characteristics like race, religion, age, gender, family, ideology, or wealth, and they operate civilization's science, politics, or economics by controlling society's tools. Every civilization needs a nobility, because every civilization has a ruling philosophy to defend. Note, I often use “nobility”, but you could reword this as royalty, aristocracy, elites, establishment, authorities—it basically refers to anyone with a hand in guarding the ruling philosophy. The noble families of Europe keeping Cinderella out of the party are one example. The rich senatorial families of Republican Rome, and the voting citizens of ancient Athens are others.

Whether anyone is a Darth King, or Darth Blockbuster, depends on the road map of tool development. Transformative technologies like the printing press, telescope, gun, and steam engine are new tools whose power should be shared.

Revolutions happen because of delayed sharing. For example, when the printing press empowered everyone in society to start reading, many nobles refused to accept once upon a time illiterate peasants/extras were increasingly educated people capable of particpating in their own government. But as nobles refused to distribute political power, they turned what should have been a series of moderate reforms, into a revolution of sudden ones.

There's a lesson. Although new technology enables a new philosphy, it's not until the extras realize the potential that a change happens. Change is thus triggered when a great thinker writes “magic words” inside seminal books that make extras realize the new options provided by transformative technology. Whether these options are scientific, political, or economic, they give new answers to insert into a civilization’s DNA. If enough people believe in the magic, change happens.

So let's get to work, and create a new philosophy, but telling you a story about the new world our new tools make possible, once the extras feel their hearts sing together.

## Our Ruling Philosophy

Today the red blue philosophy can be summarized like this, taken from a Bloomberg BusinessWeek article a few years back.

>The United States has no purpose. That is, perhaps, its greatest achievement. America’s founding document, its Declaration of Independence, allows the state to exist only to secure life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That’s it. There’s a curious lack of ambition in those words. The United States was not founded for the greater glory of anything or as the necessary outcome of history; it was founded for the freedom to collect figurines, to join a clogging troupe, to take a road trip. Yet these words, which carry no ideology whatsoever, are the ones that keep winning (against other political and economic systems, such as fascism and communism). This is the lesson of the past 10 years...The most successful organizing principle the world has ever known is a simple guarantee that we can buy and do things that have no purpose greater than the satisfaction of our own happiness.

We'll discover where this came from, why it's holding us back, and how we can overcome it, throughout this book.
