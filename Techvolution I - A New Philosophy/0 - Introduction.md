# INTRODUCTION

## Freeing Cinderella

“Extras are born free; and everywhere they are in chains.” Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote that in 1762. He was the King of France. No he wasn’t. He was the richest man in England. Nope. Rousseau was a poor writer who copied sheets of music to make the rent. More than 300 years later, he is recognized as being a great philosopher, a political visionary, and a protagonist who helped free the world with his new philosophy.

Rousseau lived when kings and queens, dukes and duchesses ruled civilization. A time when Mozart played inside exquisite palaces during the nobility's many banquets and balls. This was the image of opulence that had Cinderella dreaming her days away as she cleaned a dirty chateau. Sadly, unlike the the fairy tale, the extras didn't have a fairy Godmother to make dreams come true. Instead, commoners cleaned the noble's vast libraries, used guns while dying in their wars, and wondered what it looked like through a telescope. The extras were excluded from the power of new tools because they believed their beloved Holy Bible said only noble people had the "divine right to rule".

Rousseau called bullshit. In truth, Jesus was a carpenter, and books, guns, and scientific instruments should liberate the extras who were only in chains for the happiness of con artists. The self-proclaimed “divine nobility” didn’t like hearing that. This powerful self-protecting community of Darth Kings declared Rousseau a banquet-pooper, and chased him out of Switzerland, France, and England. Maybe that’s why Rousseau rented instead of owned.

Starting in 1776, within Rousseau’s lifetime, Darth King started to face the music, when the American people started a revolution. One year after he died, the French had one too in 1789. And on it went from country to country because Rousseau, and others like him, discovered the magic words for extras to realize they should become protagonists in a civilization “of the people, for the people, by the people”. Cinderella soon forgot about the fancy ball, and instead played the music of freedom, in a choir of equals that sounded something like this:

>Do you hear the people sing?
Singing a song of angry men?
It is the music of a people
Who will not be slaves again
When the beating of your heart
Echo’s the beating of the drums
There is a life about to start
When tomorrow comes!

Revolutionary songs like this spread the people’s liberty, equality and fraternity throughout the world. In a few years, civilization changed its philosphy from _knowing_ the nobles were divine, to _knowing_ they were villians. When the people took control of books, guns, and science, they put presidents and senators, judges and sherriffs in power, who ruled at the request new protagonists who built a civilization with checks and balances, because no one was divine. A change empowered by tools, thought of in philosophy, yet made real with the bloodshed of revolutions.

Rousseau died never having found a home. After they won their revolutions, a population of heroes put him to rest inside the glorious Panthéon; as a renowned breaker of chains, in a free world he helped build. Where any guy can be the prince, and any girl can be Cinderella.

The question for us is, how did Rousseau do it?

## The Road to Techvolution, and the Death of Revolutions

The easy answer is he made people realized they lived on the frontline today, and the ruling philosophy was from the past. See, even though the people didn't have telescopes, guns, or books, society did. Thus the people were continually disadvantaged. It's like a student at University today. He can use Wikipedia to find an answer, but still isn't allowed to reference it in term-paper. So he spends hours searching through books instead.

Likewise, even though French and Americans could read up on current events, they still couldn't vote their opinion. Rousseau made the people realize the society they lived in, the one filled with tools, was reality, while the ruling philsophy was behind the times.

This change required started revolution, a sudden questioning of a civilization’s ruling philosophy. The American, French and all the others in the 19th centuries were so violent, because the divide between ruling philosophy, and frontline society, was so wide.

Here we must say, the nobility are the gatekeepers of the ruling philosophy, but not necessarily are they Darth Blockbusters. They are group of people who share a mix of characteristics like race, religion, age, gender, family, ideology, or wealth, and they operate civilization's science, politics, or economics by controlling society's tools. Every civilization needs a nobility, because every civilization has a ruling philosophy to defend. Note, I often use “nobility”, but you could reword this as royalty, aristocracy, elites, establishment, authorities—it basically refers to anyone with a hand in guarding the ruling philosophy. The noble families of Europe keeping Cinderella out of the party are one example. The rich senatorial families of Republican Rome, and the voting citizens of ancient Athens are others.

Whether anyone is a Darth, depends if they're withholding the power of new tools for themselvse. Transformative technologies like the printing press, telescope, gun, and steam engine are new tools whose power should be shared.

Revolutions happen because of delayed sharing. For example, when the printing press empowered everyone in society to start reading, many nobles refused to accept once upon a time illiterate peasants/extras were increasingly educated people capable of particpating in their own government. But as nobles refused to distribute political power, they turned what should have been a series of moderate reforms, into a revolution of sudden ones. Thus, to enable techvolution, and rid the world of revolutions, we need a  road map of tool development.

Nature doesn’t have Darth Blockbuster, and thus doesn’t have “evolutions”, just continual evolution.  Techvolution is about smotthing out human evolution by empowering extras to continually pick better tools for their problems on the fronitline. Among the many benefits of that, means we'll never have revolutions again.
