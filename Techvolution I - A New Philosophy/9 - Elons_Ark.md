## Backpage

Donald Trump is the saviour of the world.

If that statement inspires hatred or love you're the one of growing crowd that's annoying the rest of us to tune out. Your hateful screams and chants of support, it all means nothing. It's noise. All you're trying to do is shift blame for our society's problems onto anyone but yourself. You need each other because you're contributions don't speak for themselves.

Of course, you're so brainwashed by old philosophies you think otherwise. Before you read the new philosophy called Techvolution, this preview will educate you on what every other lifeform on Earth knows. Only evolution determines if we survive or die. Anyone whose been in the wild will now this. Once you do, you'll shut up and get to work so humanity can thrive once again.

## Our problems - Rates Up

What do you want from politics? If you want screaming, yelling, blame, and picking a group of people to fight. Go do that.

## How Life Solves Problems



Creatures continue playing because their combination of attributes gives them an edge. But, as the planet inevitably changes, traits lose their advantage. Thus, while evolution is a constant race to harvest resources more efficiently, no species ever knows if its list of adaptions is good enough to overcome the problems of its environment. That's why pain hurts so much; it's Life's way of telling individuals to change their behavior and try something else before it's too late.

Evolution has these laws:

 - No species survives forever.
 - All lifeforms have a common ancestry.
 - Evolution of new species is gradual.
 - The number of species always multiplies to fill niches.
 - Natural selection determines which individuals lives on.

These laws describe the patterns and processes of evolution. The competition started after a few amino acids combined to form the first cells 3.6 billion years ago. Since then, evolution has continually created new species. Each is based on the prior one, but each removes or adds traits to find an edge. That edge could mean simple improvements like getting bigger or smaller, faster or slower. Or, the edge could be a specialization to find a niche no one else has, such as polar bears being the only seal hunters seals in a frozen ecosystem.

Regardless of what new adaptation an organism evolves, evolution's selection of the best adaptations requires daily and hourly scrutiny throughout the world of every adaptation, even the slightest. The best way to continually test species is with ecosystems. By putting creatures inside a shared environment, there are checks and balances to keep everyone able to harvest resources from the environment and each other. So when any plant, fungus, scavenger, predator, herbivore, or omnivore falls behind, Life can easily search the ecosystem and create a new species to take the laggard's place. Crucially, all lifeforms cooperate inside ecosystems to keep Life playing the game of survival.

It took scientists centuries to demystify the story of Life's evolution, and this summary misses the many details. But the essence is here: Life must adapt new species to Earth's ever-changing environment. The faster, the better; the more species, the better. Individual evolution suffers no interference because individuals are Life's unit of selection. Wherever there's liquid water, an artist named evolution works night and day, creating custom lifeforms to harvest every possible ray of sunshine, food scrap, and heat source. Evolutions's constant stream of creations is the only reason Earth isn't just another rock revolving around a star with no one to notice how beautiful the Universe is.

Because animals sadly can't change their genes. Like the polar bear now, all must endure the pain of "survival of the fittest" to evolve. We humans also evolved via the same laws of evolution. But once we invented technology, our evolution started to look a little different.
