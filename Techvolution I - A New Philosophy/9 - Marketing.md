## Mixed Ideological Politics

>I thought you guys would like to hear the story. I know my fellow wrestlers know exactly what I'm talking about. A [martial art] is either real or it's not. It's very early on in the sport of mixed martial arts. When the logical assumption from the marketing team is that you're going to get every taekwondo student, every karate student, every judo practitioner, and every aikido and they're just going to absolutely love [mixed-martial arts].

>It ended up being the absolute opposite.

>All of those arts that I just named that turned out to not be real, or at least real in terms of their effectiveness in actual combat, steered as far away from [mixed martial arts] as they could. [They] begged their students not to watch. Found a number of different reasons why [mixed martial arts] is too violent or too, whatever their excuse was.

>Because [the practioners of martial arts] didn't like what they were finding out. They had bought into it they had spent their life they had mastered some of these movements to only find out that it was a waste of time.

Are you sick of today's politics? The ranting and raving. The endless half-truths and memes that only serve to entrench already held beliefs. This books feels your pain. It's geared to the moderate middle who want politics to be about rationale problem-solving instead of inflaming hatred.

Solving pain is what this book is all about. To limit pain, why we humans invent tools, technology and self-defence techniques.

Learning a little about martial arts starts our journey to fix our politics. We can take a deep lesson from those who train very hard to avoid some very bad pain.

Karate, kickboxing, wrestling, jiu-jitsu, judo, and boxing being among the most common martial arts today. Each of these disciplines use the same human body to train powerful techniques to subdue an opponent. When competing each discipline creates rules that say only their techniques are allowed; there's no kicking in a boxing match for example.

In the late 1980s, as home televisions and cable spread information across the world, once isolated fighting cultures started to change. People got curious. Some boxers started to train submissions. Thai kickboxers learned some wrestling. Masters in one discipline started as eager newbies in another. Many martial artists began to follow the rules of evolution and adopted the philosophy of "adapt or die."

The world of martial arts started to get all mixed up.

Eventually, after several years of watching, learning, and participating in the cross-pollination of techniques between the world's martial arts, fighters started to ask themselves, "which martial art is best?"

Would a boxer beat a kickboxer? What would happen if a wrestler fought a karate guy? What these people were asking is what if we threw away the rule book and just fought a fight.

In the early 1990s, the questions stopped, and the fighting started. At first, called Vale Tudo, then Ultimate Fighting, martial artists from every discipline fought in fights with no rules. Finally, the world's masters could prove their martial art was the best in the world!

And the winner of the best martial art wasâ€¦

All of them are.

And none of them. 

And this surprised everyone. Every discipline thought it was the best, but it was only good at its techniques. It seems obvious, but it wasn't. Every martial artist evolved inside its man-made rules. Their culture, referees, coaches, and pundits, everyone didn't care to notice Nature has no rules. The winner of a real right is the person left standing. Said another way, true fights should not be judged according to who has the best techniques but who can use any method to win a battle.

Every lifeform on Earth knows this.

No deer in the world depends on a judge to save it when fighting off a bear, as no bear depends on a judge declaring it the winner to get its next meal. Yet humans did believe man-made rules would save them in a fight.

We're not stupid. We just easily fall prey to good storytelling. 

Each martial artist was so encased into the history, culture, traditions, of their sport they were inside echo chambers that created a reality so complete, it tricked people into thinking it was real. Hence people fought real fights without fear of their opponent's techniques.

Think of that.

Many martial artists got beaten up black and blue, knocked unconscious, or suffocated by a choke hold because human storytelling convinced them fights have rules.

Once martial artists opened their minds, they started fighting for themselves. They quickly realized the rules of boxing, kickboxing, wrestling, etc., were excellent for honing their techniques but were also artificial and must be forgotten when preparing for an actual fight.

Once the martial arts community learned to "adapt or die," they eventually became "faceless"; they stopped acting how they wanted and evolved what they needed. Instead of falling prey to their martial arts culture, history, and storytelling of being the best, martial artists slowly embraced evolution as their best instructor. Training all disciplines teaches these new martial artists to thwart any attack and threaten an adversary when an opportunity arises.

Once martial artists adopted the rules of evolution, they entered a brave new world. 

A world of remarkable progress. With an open mind, fighters improved themselves by leaps and bounds every year. Boxers became wrestlers, and Jiu-jitsu black belts learned high-kicks. The individual disciplines brought their techniques to an open marketplace of ideas. Real fights were experiments to highlight the best fighting adaptions and weed out the bad ones in a process similar to the scientific method.

With evolution as their ultimate teacher, these new martial artists started to listen to their bodies to tell them which techniques were best. The faster the victories, and the less pain suffered in winning them, was the best judge, teacher, and pundit of fighting philosophies. The best martial arts trainers were the ones who helped their students adapt faster.

This new open-minded fighting philosophy was so successful it created a new way for humans to train and combat called mixed-martial arts.

In mixed martial arts, fighters don't limit themselves within the confines of an artificial rulebook. Anyone with an open mind can learn a little from every discipline. The best technique is reveal by its effectual truth to show results.

Mixing the human body's adaptability with a free mind created a new, self-correcting, and sustainable martial art. Since mixed martial arts includes all techniques, any person, whether short or tall, chubby or skinny, aggressive or meek, can find their niche and learn to win a fight.

And finding a niche is what evolution is all about.

Here's what we should take from the story of mixed-martial arts. 

The middle-class has many systematic problems that keep getting worse. Taxes get more confusing. School gets less helpful. Insurance gets more expensive. And so much more bad trends.

Yet, we believe in a single ideolgy of "red", "blue", "green" or whatever. And this is why we're getting our asses kicked in our real lives.

Like martial arts of old, it's we keep losing in our lives, because we believe in one ideology and think our lives are governed by its rule book.

Even though all of today's ideologies centuries ago. The middle-class today is getting its ass kicked because we believe in the storytelling of ideologies so deeply, we're like old martial artists who forgot Nature has no rules, and evolution tells us to try whatever works until we win.

That's what this book _Techvolution_ is. It's a rebellion inside your mind that realizes you are a lifeform in Nature, and thus no rules apply except those that help you solve practical everyday problems. Humans evolve with tools, so your job is to solve frontline pain to evolve life on Earth with technology.

This new philosophy gives you the freedom of mind to mix and match ideologies as needed to overcome any political or economic problem you face. Be it a dreadful morning commute, climate change, or government red tape.

This new philosophy called Techvolution might be called mixed ideological politics. Sadly, practicing mixed-ideological politics can be challenging.

Ideologues tell great stories. Except they don't want you to read their stories, they want you to live them. To practice mixed ideological politics, you'll need to avoid being sucked into the fascinating stories ideologues tell. Before you can pick and choose better politics and policies from any ideology, we need to protect you from ideological storytelling.

To free you from ideologies, you'll learn everything about storytelling. We did that in Story-Cut Tools. 

Techvolution is the aftermath. After it, you'll be as powerful in your politics as a mixed martial artist is in a street fight.
