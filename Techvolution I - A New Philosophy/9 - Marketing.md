## Mixed Ideological Politics

>I thought you guys would like to hear this story. I know my fellow wrestlers know exactly what I'm talking about. A martial art is either real or it's not. Very early on in the sport of mixed-martial arts, when the logical assumption from the marketing team is that you're going to get every taekwondo student, every karate student, every judo practitioner, and every aikido and they're just going to absolutely love mixed-martial arts.

>It ended up being the absolute opposite.

>All of those arts that I just named that, turned out to not be real, or at least real in terms of their effectiveness in actual combat, steered as far away from mixed-martial arts as they could. They begged their students not to watch. Found a number of different reasons why mixed-martial arts is too violent or too, whatever their excuse was.

>Because the practioners of old martial arts didn't like what they were finding out. They had bought into it. They had spent their life. They had mastered some of these old martial arts movements. To only find out that it was a waste of time.

Are you sick of today's politics? The ranting and raving. The endless half-truths and memes that only serve to entrench already held beliefs. This books feels your pain. It's geared to the moderate middle who want politics to be about rational problem-solving instead of hollow attention-seeking.

Solving pain is what this book is all about.

To fight pain we humans develop things. We change government policies to direct our resources in better ways. We invent tools to solve our problems with lasting solutions. And, we learn new ideas to expand our minds.

Whatever we develop, we do it to solve our pain.

Martial arts is a great example of this quest. Karate, kickboxing, taekwondo, wrestling, aikido, jiu-jitsu, judo, and boxing are our most famous self-defense disciplines. Each teaches techniques to subdue an opponent. When training and competing each discipline creates rules that say only their techniques are allowed; there's no kicking in a boxing match for example.

The world's martial arts co-existed for many years. Teachers happily taught the right way to perform each technique to the next generation. Practioners would train almost everyday. The best students would compete in tournaments, get scholarships, and strive to become world champions. And, believers of a martial art would congregate around experts, promotions, and the latest news.

But never would these martial arts fight across disciplines.

However, in the late 1980s, as home televisions spread information across the world, once isolated fighting cultures started to open up. People got curious. Fighters started to ask themselves, "which martial art is best?"

Would a boxer beat a kickboxer? What would happen if a wrestler fought a karate guy? What if martial artists threw away the rule books and fought a real fight.

In the early 1990s, the questions stopped, and the fighting started. At first called Vale Tudo, then Ultimate Fighting, martial artists from every discipline fought in fights with no rules. Finally, the world's fighting masters could prove their martial art was the best in the world!

And the winner of the best martial art was...

All of them are.

And none of them. 

And this surprised everyone. The martial arts community assumed one discipline would reign supreme. But each discipline had a limited toolbox of techniques. Sometimes those techniques were very effective in a real fight. But often they were not. For example, karate's katas, taekwondo's flashy high-kicks, boxing's obesssion with standing toe-to-toe and swinging for a knockout. In a real fight many beloved martial arts techniques like these were easily countered.

No martial art discipline was complete.

Before the open competition of Ultimate Fighting, each martial art didn't need to notice that. Each was happily vested into its own sub-culture that hid the fact Nature has no rules and the winner of a real right is the person left standing.

Said another way, many martial arts students were tricked into thinking fights should judged according to man-made rules instead of real-world results. And, as Ultimate Fighting grew over the 1990s and 2000s, it forced reflection among the martial art communities.

As said in the opening quote, many practioners, referees, coaches, and pundits (especially from the least effective disciplines) choose to retreat back into their sub-cultures because they "didn't like what they were finding out." However, many fighters accepted the effectual truth being revealed by Ultimate Fighting. 

And so, the world of martial arts started to get all mixed up.

Some boxers started to train submissions. Thai kickboxers learned some wrestling. Masters in one discipline started as eager newbies in another. Eventually, after several years of watching, learning, and participating in the cross-pollination of techniques, these fighters evolved skills far beyond their old martial arts teachers and cultures.

With the constant physical pain of failure, and a newly open mind, martial artists adopted evolution's philosophy of "adapt or die." Human self-defense finally learned what every lifeform on Earth knows; there is no rule-book.

No deer in the world depends on a judge to save it when fighting off a bear, as no bear depends on a pundit declaring it the winner to get its next meal.

Humans we're wrong to think a single discipline or technique is the best. The best technique is entirely depenedant on assessing ones's opponent and surroundings while measuring the risks and rewards of the fight. But fighters were not stupid. Their fault is quite human; they fell prey to good storytelling. 

Quality storytelling is why so many devoted boxers, judokas, and other martial artists were engrossed into their respective history, culture, traditions. Isolated martial art disciplines acted like echo chambers with a reality so complete, it tricked people into believing it was the single source of truth. Hence martial artists fought street fights without fear of their opponent's techniques.

Ignorance wasn't bliss for the many martial artists who got beaten up black and blue, knocked unconscious, or suffocated by a choke hold because human storytelling convinced them real fights conform to their discipline's rulebook.

Once martial artists opened their minds, they started fighting for themselves. Fighters quickly realized the rules of boxing, kickboxing, wrestling, etc., were excellent for honing their techniques but were also artificial and must be forgotten when preparing for an actual fight.

Once the martial arts community learned to "adapt or die," they eventually stopped acting how they wanted and evolved what they needed. Instead of falling prey to their martial arts culture, history, and storytelling, martial artists slowly embraced evolution as their instructor.

Once martial artists adopted the rules of evolution, they entered a brave new world. 

A world of remarkable progress. With an open mind and access to the world's information on the internet, fighters improved themselves by leaps and bounds every year. Boxers became wrestlers, Jiu-jitsu black belts learned high-kicks. The individual disciplines brought their techniques to an open marketplace of ideas.

With evolution as their ultimate teacher, these new martial artists started to listen to their bodies instead of other peoples stories. The speed of victories, and the less pain suffered in winning them, was the best judge, teacher, and pundit of what's the best fighting philosophy. The best martial arts trainers were the ones who helped their students adapt faster.

This new evolutionary fighting philosophy was so successful it created a new way for humans to think of self-defense called mixed-martial arts.

In mixed-martial arts, fighters don't limit themselves within the confines of an artificial rulebook. Everyone should learn a little from every discipline. The best technique is the one that brings results. So devoted to evolution, mixed-martial artists want everyone to improve because, "iron sharpens iron".

Mixing the human body's adaptability with a free mind created a new, self-correcting, and sustainable martial art. Even a moderate mixed-martial artist would defeat a master of a single discipline. Just as important, since mixed-martial arts includes all techniques, any person, whether short or tall, heavy or thin, aggressive or meek, can find their niche and learn to win a fight. 

And finding a niche is what evolution is all about. By empowering anyone and everyone, mixed-martial arts is the ultimate fighting philosophy.

To learn self-defence today, you best learn mixed-martial arts. You may also train boxing, wrestling, and other disciples, but by learning mixed-martial arts, you'll understand the limitations of each discipline. And especially important, by practicing mixed-martial arts you'll always judge your skill level against a real fight.

And, on our journey to improve our politics, here's the lessons we should take from the story of mixed-martial arts.

Today, in the early 21st century, the middle-class has many systematic problems that keep getting worse. Taxes get more confusing. School prepares students less for the job market. Insurance gets more expensive. And there are many more topics trending badly.

We all want better for ourselves and our kids. So we turn to politics to make it happen. The worst things get, the more political people become. Politics to us means a single ideolgy of "red", "blue", "green" and so on. We back one of these by donating, buying books, watching pundits, and...

We keep getting our asses kicked in our real lives.

Like martial arts of old, we keep losing because we believe in _one_ ideology and wrongfully think our lives are governed by its rule book.

The middle-class is so engrossed in the storytelling of ideologies, all the books, lectures, shows, pundits are like old martial artists masters convincing us following their rules gives automatic success. And when we feel the pain of real life problems, we're told the other disciplines are not options because they break the ideological rule-book.

The truth is, the storytelling of today's political ideologies are incomplete.

That's why I wrote _Techvolution_. It starts a rebellion inside your mind to help you realize you're a lifeform in Nature, and thus no rules apply except those that help you solve practical everyday problems.

Nature is a street fight, and evolution is the only teacher you need.

Techvolution gives you the freedom of mind to mix and match ideologies to overcome any political or economic problem. Be it a dreadful morning commute, rising climate change, or debilitating government red tape. This new philosophy might be called mixed-ideological politics.

To see above today's onslaught of cable news, Twitter feeds, and other ideological stories, we must dissect storytelling. We did that in [Story-Cut Tools](https://storycuttools.netlify.app/). After reading that short book, you'll understand how stories work and how to avoid falling victim to their echo chamber power. (If you don't want to, we'll give a summary of the essentials in the next chapter.)

Techvolution is what comes after the realization you don't need to only believe in a single ideology. After reading this book, you'll be as powerful in your politics as a mixed-martial artist is in a street fight.
