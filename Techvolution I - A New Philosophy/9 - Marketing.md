## Mixed Ideological Politics

>I thought you guys would like to hear this story. I know my fellow wrestlers know exactly what I'm talking about. A martial art is either real or it's not. Very early on in the sport of mixed-martial arts, when the logical assumption from the marketing team is that you're going to get every taekwondo student, every karate student, every judo practitioner, and every aikido and they're just going to absolutely love mixed-martial arts.

>It ended up being the absolute opposite.

>All of those arts that I just named that, turned out to not be real, or at least real in terms of their effectiveness in actual combat, steered as far away from mixed-martial arts as they could. They begged their students not to watch. Found a number of different reasons why mixed-martial arts is too violent or too, whatever their excuse was.

>Because the practioners of old martial arts didn't like what they were finding out. They had bought into it. They had spent their life. They had mastered some of these old martial arts movements. To only find out that it was a waste of time.

Are you sick of today's politics? The ranting and raving. The endless half-truths and memes that only serve to entrench already held beliefs. This books feels your pain. It's geared to the moderate middle who want politics to be about rational problem-solving.

Solving pain is what this book is all about.

To fight pain we humans develop things. We change government policies to direct our resources in better ways. We invent tools to solve our problems with lasting solutions. And, we learn new ideas to expand our minds.

Whatever we develop, we do it to solve our pain.

Martial arts is a great example of this quest. Karate, kickboxing, taekwondo, wrestling, aikido, jiu-jitsu, judo, and boxing are our most popular self-defense disciplines. They each teach a set of techniques to subdue an opponent. When training and competing each discipline creates rules that say only their techniques are allowed; there's no kicking in a boxing match for example.

The world's martial arts co-existed for many years. Inside each discipline, teachers happily taught the chosen techniques to the next generation. Practioners would train almost everyday. The best students would compete in tournaments, get scholarships, and strive to become world champions. And, believers of a martial art would congregate around experts, tournaments, and the latest news.

But never would these martial arts fight across disciplines.

However, in the late 1980s, as home televisions spread information across the world, once isolated fighting cultures started to open up. People got curious. Fighters started to ask themselves, "which martial art is best?"

Would a boxer beat a kickboxer? What would happen if a wrestler fought a karate guy? Many people starting ask what if martial artists threw away the rule books and fought a real fight.

In the early 1990s, the questions stopped, and the fighting started. At first called Vale Tudo, then Ultimate Fighting, martial artists from every discipline fought in fights with no rules. Finally, the world's fighting masters could prove their martial art was the best on Earth!

And the winner of the best martial art was...

All of them are.

And none of them. 

This revelation surprised everyone. The martial arts community assumed one discipline would reign supreme. But that wasn't the case because each discipline had a limited toolbox of techniques. Sometimes those techniques were very effective in a real fight; like some Brazilian jit jitsu's submissions, or wrestling's dominate control. But many techniques like karate's katas, taekwondo's flashy high-kicks, boxing's obesssion with standing toe-to-toe and swinging for a knockout were easily countered and therefore not effective.

After several years of fighting no rules tournaments it became clear that some martial arts were more effective than others, but each had drawbacks and none was complete. As Ultimate Fighting grew in popularity during the 1990s and 2000s, it forced the martial art communities to reflect on their techniques and proclamations.

As said in the opening quote, many practioners, referees, coaches, and pundits (especially from the least effective disciplines) choose to retreat back into their sub-cultures because they, "didn't like what they were finding out." Fortunately, many fighters accepted the effectual truth revealed by Ultimate Fighting. 

And so, the world of martial arts started to get all mixed up.

Some kickboxers started to train submissions. Wrestlers learned some punching. Masters in one discipline started as eager newbies in another. Eventually, after several years of watching, learning, and participating in the cross-pollination of techniques, these fighters evolved skills far beyond their old martial arts teachers and disciplines.

Listening to the physical pain of failure with a newly open mind, martial artists adopted evolution's philosophy of "adapt or die." Human self-defense finally learned what every lifeform on Earth knows; there is no rulebook.

No deer in the world depends on a judge to save it when fighting off a bear, as no bear depends on a pundit declaring it the winner to get its next meal.

Just like in Nature, the best martial art technique is entirely dependant on ones's opponent and surroundings while measuring the risks and rewards of the fight. Whatever techniques are most efficient to win the fight are the best.

For decades, all fighters put the horse before the cart, so to speak. They had the answers before knowing the problem. Martial arts students were tricked into thinking fights are won or lost according to man-made rules governeed by teachers, pundits, and judges instead of real-world results. 

Despite sometimes getting beaten black and blue, martial artists were never stupid. Their fault is quite human; they fell prey to good storytelling. 

Quality storytelling is why so many devoted boxers, judokas, and other practioners were so easily misled by their respective discipline. Filled with history, culture, traditions isolated martial art disciplines acted like echo chambers with a reality so complete, it tricked people into believing it was the single source of truth.

Once martial artists opened their minds, they started fighting for themselves. Fighters quickly realized the rules of boxing, kickboxing, wrestling, etc., were excellent for honing their techniques but were also artificial and must be forgotten when preparing for an actual fight.

Thus evolution became martial artists instructor and the community entered a brave new world. 

A world of remarkable progress. With an open mind and access to the world's information on the internet, fighters improved themselves by leaps and bounds every year. Kickboxers became wrestlers, Jiu-jitsu black belts learned high-kicks. The individual disciplines brought their techniques to an open marketplace of ideas.

With evolution as their teacher, these new martial artists started to listen to their bodies instead of other peoples stories. The speed of victories, and the less pain suffered in winning them, was the best judge, teacher, and pundit of what's the best fighting philosophy. The top martial arts trainers were the ones who helped their students adapt faster.

This new evolutionary fighting philosophy was so successful it created a new way for humans to think of self-defense called mixed-martial arts.

In mixed-martial arts, fighters don't limit themselves within the confines of an artificial rulebook. Everyone should learn a little from every discipline. The best technique is the one that brings results. So devoted to evolution, mixed-martial artists want everyone to improve because, "iron sharpens iron".

Mixing the human body's adaptability with a free mind created a new, self-correcting, and sustainable martial art. Today, even a moderately skilled mixed-martial artist is an overwhelming favorite against a champion of any single fighting discipline. Just as important, since mixed-martial arts includes all techniques, any person, whether short or tall, heavy or thin, aggressive or meek, can find their niche and learn to win a fight. 

And finding a niche is what evolution is all about. By empowering anyone and everyone, mixed-martial arts is the ultimate fighting philosophy.

On our journey to improve our politics, here's the lessons we should take from the story of mixed-martial arts.

Today, in the early 21st century, the middle-class has many systematic problems. Taxes get more confusing. School prepares students less for the job market. Insurance gets more expensive. And there are many more topics trending badly.

We all want better for ourselves and our kids. So we turn to politics to make it happen. The worst things get, the more political people become. Politics to us means a single ideology of "red", "blue", "green" and so on. We back one of these by donating time and money, buying books, following pundits, giving our loyalty, and...

We keep getting our asses kicked in our real lives.

Like old martial artists who believed their chosen discipline was the single source of truth, the middle-class keeps losing because we believe in _one_ ideology and wrongfully think our lives are governed by its rulebook.

And as our economy keeps getting worse, the more people buy into one ideology's storytelling. It's easy to because many teachers, pundits, commentators are selling us their books, lectures, podcasts. Each is like old martial arts masters telling us stories how their techniques give automatic success.

And when we continue to feel the pain of real life problems, we're told the other disciplines are not options because they break the ideological rulebook. Or even worse, we're told we must attack other ideologies because the failing economy is _their_ fault.

The truth is, all political ideologies and their economic plans are incomplete.

That's why I wrote _Techvolution_. It helps break any steadfast loyalty to one ideology and encourages you to realize you're a lifeform in Nature, and thus the only rules and techniques that matter are those that help you reliably solve your everyday problems.

Nature is a street fight, and evolution is the only teacher you need.

Techvolution gives you the freedom of mind to mix and match ideologies to overcome any political or economic problem. Be it a dreadful morning commute, rising climate change, or debilitating government red tape. This new philosophy might be called mixed-ideological politics.

Seeing through today's onslaught of Twitter feeds, cable news, dinner table arguments will be hard. To see above today's political noise requires a understanding of storytelling. One you got that, you'll avoid being sucked into the false security of ideological echo chambers.

Techvolution and its mixed-ideological politics is what comes after the realization you don't need to believe in a single ideology. After reading this book, you'll be as powerful in your politics as a mixed-martial artist is in a fight.

* Note: if you're so curious, we analyze storytelling more indepth in _Story-Cut Tools_.

## Echo Chambers Are Needed, Until They're Not

- Remember we're not erasing ideologies.

It would be nice if humanity created mixed-martial arts first. Spending hundreds of years developing martial arts techniques the ultimately proved ineffective seems like a waste. But starting off with mixed-martial arts wasn't possible.

We had to invent lots of options in order to select the best. Only ignorant people think great results don't require lots of wasted effort. Every hit product starts off with a poor first try. Every great book has hundreds of erased pages.

By the same token, to invent martial art techniques needed lots of wasted effort. So while boxing alone isn't too effective againt a trained mixed-martial artist, for humanity to learn excellent punching techniques required we create boxing. Same applies to judo and its bodythrows, jiu-jitsu and its submissions, and so on for every discipline. Being isolated inside an echo chamber enforced by strict rulebooks allowed the practioners inside a martial art to iterate and perfect their selected techniques.

The obstacle mixed-martial arts had to overcome wasn't the rulebooks of martial arts disciplines, but their proclamations about being the single source of truth.

By thinking they had the monopoly on truth, old martial arts had the solution before hearing the problem. Such ignorance is sadly a common drawback of humanity. It's natural to advocate for one's skillset. It's also natural to resist realizing those skills are outdated; starting all over is a hard reality for anyone to accept.

The achievement of mixed-martial arts is banishing ignorance from martial arts and replacing it with enlightenment. Anyone who chooses mixed-martial arts knows there are no easy answers because real fights have endless possibilities. Thus, the culture of mixed-martial arts, from teachers to commentators, newbies to veterans, is that any proclamation about being the "single source of truth" is a lie.

Thus, it's vital to remember there is nothing wrong with all but the extremist of today's ideologies. This book is not trying to erase your preferred ideology anymore than a mixed-martial artist wants to erase boxing. Every sub-culture has something to offer. But none can consider their techniques the single source of truth. Each ideology must be mixed and matched as needed by the problem being solved.

To soothe doubters that our politics can be rationalized like this, in addition to mixed-martial arts, modern medicine is another example of this kind of enlightenment.

Modern medicine has many disciplines and specialists. Some are based on cutting edge research, others on old school remedies. In the past, when isolated by geography and culture, people would be bound to do what the local healer or doctor prescribed. But today, you would never go to one medical professional, expecting them to be a master of every possible health problem.

There's simply too many problems for any one medical discipline.

That's because all medical professionals, from hemopathic healers to neural surgeons, are sub-disciplines. Each has their own techniques, cultures, and rulebooks, and none say they are the single source of truth. The skill in modern medicine is mixing disciplines to solve a patients pain. While modern medicine certainly isn't perfect (especially its administration), compared to the past medicine filled with leeches, witchcraft, and one-size fits all solutions, it's nearly magical. Modern medicine and mixed-martial arts are both achievements in human enlightenment by being open-minded and letting the problem determine the best solution.

That book does the same for ideology.

If a person can be train to fight different techniques from many different martial arts disciplines, and the doctor who heals fighters can recommened specialists from many different medical disciplines, why can't we also learn political and economic rules (that govern Ultimate Fighting and modern medicine) can also be self-aware enough and respectful enough to know their chosen techniques strengths and weaknessess?

To enlighten our politics in such a way, we only have to accept no ideology is complete. They must be mixed and matched according to their strengths and weaknesses in solving a particular problem. Like in medicine or Ultimate Fighting, any ideological technique must be evaluated based on evidence of their results and not ideological purity.

To mix and match ideolgies today, we must break their echo chambers. As said above about martial arts disciplines, echo chambers are at first needed to foster different ideologies, but the time comes when disciplines must acknowledge they are sub-discplines in the service of a greater goal; i.e. solving any and all real-life problem.

Moving ideologies towards enlightnment has a big obstacle. Ideological pundits, teachers, commentators keep the echo chamber filled to cement their jobs and prestige and to avoid the constant open competition evolution requires.

Ideologues keep people in their echo chambers by telling great stories. To escape their spell, we must understand the magical powers of stories.

## The Story of Cinderella

- how to see through echo chambers so we can mix and match them.

The classic fairytale _Cinderella_ is a great story. It's about a orphaned country girl living with her step family. Although pretty, hard-working, and humble, Cinderella spends her days doing grueling house work because her stepmother dislikes her and much favors her own two daughters. When a gallant ball is held to find a wife for a handsome prince, Cinderella isn't allowed to attend, and must watch her two nasty stepsisters go to the ball.

And then Cinderella's fairy godmother appears. Using her magic the godmother creates the dress, horses, and staff needed for Cinderella to attend the party.

Under a false name Cinderella dazzles the gallant prince. But the spell that brought her to the ball soon ends, forcing the shy country girl to leave the prince with nothing but a glass slipper to remember her by.

The heartbroken royal orders his allies to search the country for the unknown girl who fits the glass slipper.

The search eventually gets to the house of Cinderella. The evil stepmother has gotten wise that her stepdaughter is the prince's heartthrob, and so locks her in the attic. Being the lovable girl she is, the house staff steals the key for their beloved friend. They get the attic door open in time for Cinderella to ask the prince's men if she can try on the glass slipper. But, just as she's about to, the evil stepmother shatters it.

To which Cinderella responds by revealing she has the other slipper.

And the rest is history.

The movie _Cinderella_ was very popular when it was released. It's popular today. And it'll be popular hundreds of years from now when humanity is (hopefully) travelling the stars. People will always like it because it's a great story.

People love stories. We can't get enough of them. A good story lets us experience the trials, lessons, and drama of another person. From horrible brushes with death, to whimsical romances, stories let us experience many lives.

Stories are so powerful because they create a complete reality. Everything in real life has a representation in a story. Props fill the storyworld with items from beds to airplanes. There is music to relay the emotions of characters in the story. The dialogue communicates what each character wants in a easy to understand way. Then there's the villain who earns their name because he likes world the way it is and defends it against change. Next comes the philosophy of the world the story is set in. The philosophy dictates the rules everyone in the story is supposed to live by, for example Cinderella is supposed to obey her stepmother. After that is the hero, who disreards the ruling philosphy and envisions a better world. And at the top of this story pyramid is the tools; a catchall term for the real objects and levers of power that determine who controls what happens in the story world.

The magic of good storytelling is mixing these incredients together. If done properly, the resulting cake will transfix audiences. They'll absorb the story like it really happened to them. You can see this for yourself because people will jump, scream, cry while watching what is in reality, images on a screen.

And that brings us back to echo chambers. To dismantle echo chambers starts by realizing the story of Cinderella isn't about a girl controlled by her evil step-family. It's also not a story about a girl overcoming her evil step-family to marry her prince charming.

The story of Cinderella is about a girl overcoming her step-family using levers of powers, i.e. tools.

If Cinderella doesn't get the horses, carriage, and evening dress from her fairy godmother, she'll never get into the ball. If the prince didn't find her lost slipper, she'd never see him again. If her allies didn't steal the key to the attic, she'd never get out in time. And if Cinderella didn't have the second glass slipper, the story of _Cinderella_ would be a tragedy instead of a fairy tale.

Cinderella had a problem, and it wasn't that her step-family were terrible people, it was that her terrible step-family controlled important tools and Cinderella didn't.

The drama of the story is the battle over tools. From the tickets to the royal ball, to the famous glass slipper, _Cinderella_ is a battle over real objects because only real objects can forcibly change the world.

This holds true for every story. From _Star Wars_ to _The Matrix_, the villian controls the tools and uses the ruling philosophy to justify their control. The hero suffers an injustice that lets them see a problem with the ruling philosophy. The drama of the story is whether or not the hero will seize control of the tools, implement their own philsophy, and thus change the world. 

If you were to draw our Cinderlla, this is what it looks like.

- Starting Reality - Cinderella is orphaned an living with a hateful stepfamily.
- Hero insight - Cinderella decides to disobey her cruel stepmother.
- Back and forth drama - Stepmother and Cinderella and their respective friends, battle to control evening ware, invitations, attic keys and finally glass slippers.
- New reality - Cinderella marries her prince charming and becomes a princess.

The important thing to remember when talking about echo chmabers is to realize philosophies are sub-serviant to tools. And that philosphies change when tools change. And perhaps the most important thing to learn is that once a story ends, the hero is no longer the main character.

And these are the truths those who sell being a single source of truth don't like.

## Each Tool Has Its Own Philosophy

- echo chambers change with tools, so we automatically mix and match them when we change tools.

We're already discussed how each martial art has specific techniques. Boxing has punching, wrestling man-control, and so on. Each of these techniques adapt the human body to perform a task. And in that way martial arts turn the human body into a different tool.

As we just learned, each tool has a philosophy behind it.

Boxing is about aggresive hitting, punching combinations, and footwork. Jiu-jitsu is about patience, durability, and seizing openings. Wrestling is hard training with endless reptitions. These are the philsophies needed to hardness the respective techniques of each sport.

The tools we use determine the philosophy we believe in. This is why old martial arts were so scared of mixed-martial arts. By allowing any technique, mixed-martial arts disabled any possibilility of having an eternal philosophy. And if you sell philosophy instead of real-world results, that's going to hurt your sales numbers.

Like mixed-martial arts and modern medicine, good stories also freely to mix and match tools.

For example, think of Cinderella locked inside that attic. The prince's men are so close, and if she can just get outside and try on the glass slipper her horrible life will change forever; if her friends can get the key.

Whatif they'd failed getting the key, and instead brough back a match?

Now the oppressed girl has some soul searching to do. The philsophy behind buring the house down, even to earn her freedom, is a different philosophy then getting some friends to steal a key.

The beauty of mixed-martial arts, modern medicine, and any field that selects its techniques, tools, applications based on the problem, is they are like a hero in a good story. Always free to use any tool to solve the problem at hand.

To recognize an ideologue and echo chamber, simply to ask their storytellers to change the tool. They won't be able to do it. They sell and earn their money, prestiage, on knowing a limited set of techniques and tools; be it government run social programs or corporate welfare. To let the problem determine the best solution is to threaten their self-image of being leaders.

Regardless. You can leave an echo chamber, by simply being a hero of your own story.

Be like Cinderella, decide to fight back agaisnt an injustice and find allies to help you seize the tools you need to change the world. 

## Evolution

- changing techniques/tools is evolution. changing tools is technological evolution.

So, this introduction was a lot longer than I wanted it to be. Hopefully its been worth it to get to this point.

I only needed to write so much because of one hard truth we don't yet know.

Mixed-martial arts is training to adapt the human body to perform different fighting techniques. Modern medicine is using technology to educate people to use tools uncover the causes of pain and rememdy it using the tools of a variety of different disciplines.

These human endeavors are enlightened because they disregarded human rules when they get in the way of solving problems. And in the real world and the story world, we solve problems with tools/techniques and other adaptions that can physical alter the world.

And this is how evolution works too. Life continuosly makes new species, it's the most practical ones that survive. Human evolution mimicks natural evolution. Except we do not evolve biologically as animals do. A blue whale will never fly and a monkey will never swin. Humans adapt using tools. The idiots who think humans have enough genetic diversity to explain our differences are all dead or dying. They all fell in the face of technological progress because evolution wait for no one.

Thus,... Human beings must go from creation. To selection. The first step is where echo chambers form. The second step is when we praise

But unlike Nature, we can select our own options. Once we have an enlightenment philosophy to transition people from being loyal members of a discipline, to selecting from these options based on their effectiveness in solving a problem.
