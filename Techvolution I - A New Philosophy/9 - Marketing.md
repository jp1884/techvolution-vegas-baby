## Mixed Ideological Politics

>I thought you guys would like to hear this story. I know my fellow wrestlers know exactly what I'm talking about. A martial art is either real or it's not. Very early on in the sport of mixed-martial arts, when the logical assumption from the marketing team is that you're going to get every taekwondo student, every karate student, every judo practitioner, and every aikido and they're just going to absolutely love mixed-martial arts.

>It ended up being the absolute opposite.

>All of those arts that I just named that, turned out to not be real, or at least real in terms of their effectiveness in actual combat, steered as far away from mixed-martial arts as they could. They begged their students not to watch. Found a number of different reasons why mixed-martial arts is too violent or too, whatever their excuse was.

>Because the practioners of old martial arts didn't like what they were finding out. They had bought into it. They had spent their life. They had mastered some of these old martial arts movements. To only find out that it was a waste of time.

Are you sick of today's politics? The ranting and raving. The endless half-truths and memes that only serve to entrench already held beliefs. This books feels your pain. It's geared to the moderate middle who want politics to be about rationale problem-solving instead of a blame-fest.

Solving pain is what this book is all about.

To fight pain we humans develop things. We change government policies to direct our resources in better ways. We invent tools to solve our problems with lasting solutions. And, we learn new ideas to expand our minds.

Whatever we develop, we do it to solve our pain points.

Martial arts is a great example of this quest. Karate, kickboxing, wrestling, jiu-jitsu, judo, and boxing are our most famous self-defense disciplines. Each teaches techniques to subdue an opponent. When training and competing each discipline creates rules that say only their techniques are allowed; there's no kicking in a boxing match for example.

The world's martial arts co-existed for many years. Practioners would train against each other in endless matches and tournaments; but never would they fight across disciplines.

However, in the late 1980s, as home televisions spread information across the world, once isolated fighting cultures started to open up. People got curious. Fighters started to ask themselves, "which martial art is best?"

Would a boxer beat a kickboxer? What would happen if a wrestler fought a karate guy? What if martial artists threw away the rule books and fought a real fight.

In the early 1990s, the questions stopped, and the fighting started. At first called Vale Tudo, then Ultimate Fighting, martial artists from every discipline fought in fights with no rules. Finally, the world's fighting masters could prove their martial art was the best in the world!

And the winner of the best martial art wasâ€¦

All of them are.

And none of them. 

And this surprised everyone. Every discipline thought it was the best, but it was only good at its techniques. It seems obvious to say a kickboxer is great a kicking and terrible at wrestling and therefore it's impossible to say one discipline is better than another, but it wasn't.

Every martial artist evolved inside its man-made rules. With isolation, martial art culture, referees, coaches, and pundits didn't need to notice Nature has no rules.

The winner of a real right is the person left standing.

Said another way, many martial arts students were tricked into thinking fights should judged according to rules instead of real-world results. As ultimate fighting grew over the 1990s and 2000s, it forced reflection among the world's martial artists.

As said in the opening quote, many choose to ignore progress and went back into their sub-cultures. But many people choose progress. As a result, the world of martial arts started to get all mixed up.

Some boxers started to train submissions. Thai kickboxers learned some wrestling. Masters in one discipline started as eager newbies in another. Eventually, after several years of watching, learning, and participating in the cross-pollination of techniques, fighters evolved far beyond their old martial arts teachers and cultures.

With the constant physical pain of failure, and a newly open mind, martial artists adopted the evolution's philosophy of "adapt or die." Human self-defense learned what every lifeform on Earth knows; there is no rule-book.

No deer in the world depends on a judge to save it when fighting off a bear, as no bear depends on a pundit declaring it the winner to get its next meal.

Humans we're wrong to think any single fighting discipline or technique is the best martial art. But we are not stupid. Our fault is that we fall prey to good storytelling. 

Quality storytelling is why so many devoted boxers, judokas, and other martial artists were totally engrossed into the the history, culture, traditions. Isolated martial art disciplines acted like echo chambers with a reality so complete, it tricked people into thinking it was real. Hence martial artists fought street fights without fear of their opponent's alien techniques.

Think of that.

Many martial artists got beaten up black and blue, knocked unconscious, or suffocated by a choke hold because human storytelling convinced them fights have rules. Why train for a choke hold if the referee would declare it illegal?

Once martial artists opened their minds, they started fighting for themselves. Fighters quickly realized the rules of boxing, kickboxing, wrestling, etc., were excellent for honing their techniques but were also artificial and must be forgotten when preparing for an actual fight.

Once the martial arts community learned to "adapt or die," they eventually became "faceless"; they stopped acting how they wanted and evolved what they needed. Instead of falling prey to their martial arts culture, history, and storytelling, martial artists slowly embraced evolution as their instructor.

Once martial artists adopted the rules of evolution, they entered a brave new world. 

A world of remarkable progress. With an open mind and access to the world's information on the internet, fighters improved themselves by leaps and bounds every year. Boxers became wrestlers, Jiu-jitsu black belts learned high-kicks. The individual disciplines brought their techniques to an open marketplace of ideas.

With evolution as their ultimate teacher, these new martial artists started to listen to their bodies instead of other peoples stories. The speed of victories, and the less pain suffered in winning them, was the best judge, teacher, and pundit of what's the best fighting philosophy. The best martial arts trainers were the ones who helped their students adapt faster.

This new open-minded fighting philosophy was so successful it created a new way for humans to think of self-defense called mixed-martial arts.

In mixed-martial arts, fighters don't limit themselves within the confines of an artificial rulebook. Everyone should learn a little from every discipline. The best technique is the one that brings results. So devoted to evolution, mixed-martial artists want everyone to improve because, "iron sharpens iron".

Since mixed-martial arts includes all techniques, any person, whether short or tall, heavy or thin, aggressive or meek, can find their niche and learn to win a fight. Mixing the human body's adaptability with a free mind created a new, self-correcting, and sustainable martial art.

And finding a niche is what evolution is all about. By helping everyone find their niche, mixed-martial arts is the ultimate fighting philosophy.

If you need to learn self-defence, today you learn mixed-martial arts. You may learn boxing, wrestling, and the other disciples, but because of mixed-martial arts, you'll understand the limitations of each and your real-world skill level is judge against a real-fight.

Here's what we should take from the story of mixed-martial arts. 

Today, in the early 21st century, the middle-class has many systematic problems that keep getting worse. Taxes get more confusing. School gets less helpful. Insurance gets more expensive. And there are many more bad trends.

We want better for ourselves and our kids. So we turn to politics to make it happen. The worst things get, the more political people become. Politics to us means a single ideolgy of "red", "blue", "green" and so on. We back one of these and...

We keep getting our asses kicked in our real lives.

Like martial arts of old, we keep losing because we believe in _one_ ideology and wrongfully think our lives are governed by its rule book.

The middle-class today can't learn this lesson. We're so engrossed in the storytelling of ideologies, all the books, lectures, shows, pundits are like old martial artists masters convincing us following their rules gives automatic success. 

The truth is, the storytelling of today's political ideologies are an ignoble lie.

That's why I wrote _Techvolution_. It starts a rebellion inside your mind that helps you realize you are a lifeform in Nature, and thus no rules apply except those that help you solve practical everyday problems. Nature is a street fight, and evolution is the only teacher you need.

Techvolution gives you the freedom of mind to mix and match ideologies to overcome any political or economic problem. Be it a dreadful morning commute, climate change, or government red tape. This new philosophy might be called mixed-ideological politics.

To see past ideologues great stories, you'll need to read Story-Cut Tools. It dissects storytelling like a doctor investigates a lifeform. After reading it, you'll understand how stories work and how to avoid falling victom to their influence.

Techvolution is the aftermath. It is a new philosophy to empower a improved politics. After reading this book, you'll be as powerful in your politics as a mixed-martial artist is in a street fight.
