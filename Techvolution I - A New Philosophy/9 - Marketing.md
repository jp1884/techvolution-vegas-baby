## Mixed Ideological Politics

>I thought you guys would like to hear this story. I know my fellow wrestlers know exactly what I'm talking about. A martial art is either real or it's not. Very early on in the sport of mixed-martial arts, when the logical assumption from the marketing team is that you're going to get every taekwondo student, every karate student, every judo practitioner, and every aikido and they're just going to absolutely love mixed-martial arts.

>It ended up being the absolute opposite.

>All of those arts that I just named that, turned out to not be real, or at least real in terms of their effectiveness in actual combat, steered as far away from mixed-martial arts as they could. They begged their students not to watch. Found a number of different reasons why mixed-martial arts is too violent or too, whatever their excuse was.

>Because the practioners of old martial arts didn't like what they were finding out. They had bought into it. They had spent their life. They had mastered some of these old martial arts movements. To only find out that it was a waste of time.

Are you sick of today's politics? The ranting and raving. The endless half-truths and memes that only serve to entrench already held beliefs. This books feels your pain. It's geared to the moderate middle who want politics to be about rational problem-solving.

Solving pain is what this book is all about.

To fight pain we humans develop things. We change government policies to direct our resources in better ways. We invent tools to solve our problems with lasting solutions. And, we learn new ideas to expand our minds.

Whatever we develop, we do it to solve our pain.

Martial arts is a great example of this quest. Karate, kickboxing, taekwondo, wrestling, aikido, jiu-jitsu, judo, and boxing are our most popular self-defense disciplines. They each teach a set of techniques to subdue an opponent. When training and competing each discipline creates rules that say only their techniques are allowed; there's no kicking in a boxing match for example.

The world's martial arts co-existed for many years. Inside each discipline, teachers happily taught the chosen techniques to the next generation. Practioners would train almost everyday. The best students would compete in tournaments, get scholarships, and strive to become world champions. And, believers of a martial art would congregate around experts, promotions, and the latest news.

But never would these martial arts fight across disciplines.

However, in the late 1980s, as home televisions spread information across the world, once isolated fighting cultures started to open up. People got curious. Fighters started to ask themselves, "which martial art is best?"

Would a boxer beat a kickboxer? What would happen if a wrestler fought a karate guy? Many people starting ask what if martial artists threw away the rule books and fought a real fight.

In the early 1990s, the questions stopped, and the fighting started. At first called Pancrase, Vale Tudo, then Ultimate Fighting, martial artists from every discipline fought in fights with no rules. Finally, the world's fighting masters could prove their martial art was the best in the world!

And the winner of the best martial art was...

All of them are.

And none of them. 

And this surprised everyone. The martial arts community assumed one discipline would reign supreme. But that wasn't the case because each discipline had a limited toolbox of techniques. Sometimes those techniques were very effective in a real fight; like some Brazilian jit jitsu's submissions, or wrestling's dominate control. But many techniques like karate's katas, taekwondo's flashy high-kicks, boxing's obesssion with standing toe-to-toe and swinging for a knockout were easily countered and not therefore not effective.

After several years of fighting no rules tournaments it became clear that some martial arts were more effective than others, but no discipline was complete.

Before the open competition of Ultimate Fighting, each martial art didn't need to notice that. Each was happily vested into its own sub-culture that hid the fact Nature has no rules, judges, or referres. The winner of a real right is the person left standing.

Said another way, many martial arts students were tricked into thinking fights are judged according to man-made rules instead of real-world results. And, as Ultimate Fighting grew in popularity during the 1990s and 2000s, it forced reflection among the martial art communities.

As said in the opening quote, many practioners, referees, coaches, and pundits (especially from the least effective disciplines) choose to retreat back into their sub-cultures because they, "didn't like what they were finding out." However, many fighters accepted the effectual truth revealed by Ultimate Fighting. 

And so, the world of martial arts started to get all mixed up.

Some kickboxers started to train submissions. Wrestlers learned some punching. Masters in one discipline started as eager newbies in another. Eventually, after several years of watching, learning, and participating in the cross-pollination of techniques, these fighters evolved skills far beyond their old martial arts teachers and disciplines.

With the constant physical pain of failure, and a newly open mind, martial artists adopted evolution's philosophy of "adapt or die." Human self-defense finally learned what every lifeform on Earth knows; there is no rulebook.

No deer in the world depends on a judge to save it when fighting off a bear, as no bear depends on a pundit declaring it the winner to get its next meal.

Just like in Nature, the best martial art technique is therefore entirely dependant on ones's opponent and surroundings while measuring the risks and rewards of the fight. Whatever techniques are most efficient to win the fight are the best.

For decades, all fighters believed otherwise, but they were never stupid. Their fault is quite human; they fell prey to good storytelling. 

Quality storytelling is why so many devoted boxers, judokas, and other practioners were engrossed into the respective history, culture, traditions of their respective martial arts. Isolated martial art disciplines acted like echo chambers with a reality so complete, it tricked people into believing it was the single source of truth.

Once martial artists opened their minds, they started fighting for themselves. Fighters quickly realized the rules of boxing, kickboxing, wrestling, etc., were excellent for honing their techniques but were also artificial and must be forgotten when preparing for an actual fight.

Thus evolution became martial artists instructor, and so the community entered a brave new world. 

A world of remarkable progress. With an open mind and access to the world's information on the internet, fighters improved themselves by leaps and bounds every year. Kickboxers became wrestlers, Jiu-jitsu black belts learned high-kicks. The individual disciplines brought their techniques to an open marketplace of ideas.

With evolution as their teacher, these new martial artists started to listen to their bodies instead of other peoples stories. The speed of victories, and the less pain suffered in winning them, was the best judge, teacher, and pundit of what's the best fighting philosophy. The best martial arts trainers were the ones who helped their students adapt faster.

This new evolutionary fighting philosophy was so successful it created a new way for humans to think of self-defense called mixed-martial arts.

In mixed-martial arts, fighters don't limit themselves within the confines of an artificial rulebook. Everyone should learn a little from every discipline. The best technique is the one that brings results. So devoted to evolution, mixed-martial artists want everyone to improve because, "iron sharpens iron".

Mixing the human body's adaptability with a free mind created a new, self-correcting, and sustainable martial art. Today, even a moderately skilled mixed-martial artist is an overwhelming favorite against a master of any single fighting discipline. Just as important, since mixed-martial arts includes all techniques, any person, whether short or tall, heavy or thin, aggressive or meek, can find their niche and learn to win a fight. 

And finding a niche is what evolution is all about. By empowering anyone and everyone, mixed-martial arts is the ultimate fighting philosophy.

On our journey to improve our politics, here's the lessons we should take from the story of mixed-martial arts.

Today, in the early 21st century, the middle-class has many systematic problems. Taxes get more confusing. School prepares students less for the job market. Insurance gets more expensive. And there are many more topics trending badly.

We all want better for ourselves and our kids. So we turn to politics to make it happen. The worst things get, the more political people become. Politics to us means a single ideology of "red", "blue", "green" and so on. We back one of these by donating time and money, buying books, following pundits, and...

We keep getting our asses kicked in our real lives.

Like old martial artists who believed their chosen discipline was the single source of truth, the middle-class keeps losing losing because we believe in _one_ ideology and wrongfully think our lives are governed by its rulebook.

The worse things get our economy, the more people buy into the storytelling. What's not to like, all the ideologues selling us their books, lectures, podcasts are-like old martial arts masters- telling us stories how their techniques give automatic success. 

And when we continue to feel the pain of real life problems, we're told the other disciplines are not options because they break the ideological rulebook. Or even worse, we're told we must attack other ideologies for their heresy.

The truth is, all political ideologies are incomplete.

That's why I wrote _Techvolution_. It helps break any steadfast loyalty to one ideology and encourage you to realize you're a lifeform in Nature, and thus the only rules and techniques that matter are those that help you reliably solve practical everyday problems.

Nature is a street fight, and evolution is the only teacher you need.

Techvolution gives you the freedom of mind to mix and match ideologies to overcome any political or economic problem. Be it a dreadful morning commute, rising climate change, or debilitating government red tape. This new philosophy might be called mixed-ideological politics.

Seeing through today's onslaught of Twitter feeds, cable news, dinner table argumetns is not easy. To see above the noise requires a deep understanding of storytelling. One you got that though, you'll avoid being sucked into the false security of ideological echo chambers.

Techvolution and its mixed-ideological politics is what comes after the realization you don't need to believe in a single ideology. After reading this book, you'll be as powerful in your politics as a mixed-martial artist is in a street fight.

## Echo Chambers Are Needed, Until They're Not

It would be nice if humanity started its self-defence training with mixed-martial arts. Spending hundreds of years developing martial arts techniques the ultimately proved ineffective seems like a waste. But starting off with mixed-martial arts wasn't possible.

We had to invent lots of options in order to select the best. Only ignorant people think great results don't require lots of wasted effort. Every hit product starts off with a poor first try. Every great book has hundreds of erased pages.

To invent martial art techniques similarly needed lots of wasted effort. So while boxing alone isn't too effective againt a mixed-martial artist, we wouldn't have the knowledge of excellent punching if boxing exist. Same applies to Judo and its bodythrows, jiu-jitsu and its submissions, and so on for every discipline. Being isolated inside an echo chamber allowed martial arts practioners to iterate and perfect the selected techniques of their respective discipline. 

The problem mixed-martial arts had to overcome wasn't the rulebooks of martial arts disciplines, but their proclamations about being the single source of truth.

By thinking they were the best martial art, old martial arts had the solution before hearing the problem. And this is a common drawback of humanity. Because it's natural for anyone trained in a discipline to advocate for their skillset. If those skills were wrong, they'd have to start all over again, and that's a hard reality for anyone to accept.

The achievement of mixed-martial arts is fostering human enligthenment. Everyone inside mixed-martial arts knows that each person is always learning, there are no easy answers, and it's okay to fail. Mixed-martial artists know any proclamation about being the "single source of truth" fails when facing an adversary with an open mind.

Modern medicine is another example of this kind of enlightenment.

Modern medicine has many disciplines and specialists. Some are based on cutting edge research, others on old school remedies. In the past, when isolated by geography and culture, people would be bound to do what the local healer or doctor prescribed. But today, you would never go to one medical professional, expecting them to be a master of every possible health problem.

That's because all medical professionals, from hemopathic healers to neural surgeons, are sub-disciplines. Each has their own techniques, cultures, and rulebooks, and none say they are the single source of truth. The skill in modern medicine is mixing disciplines together to solve a patients pain. While modern medicine certainly isn't perfect (especially its administration), compared to the past filled with leeches, witchcraft, and one-size fits all solutions, it's much better. Because codern medicine and mixed-martial arts are both achievements in human enlightenment by being open-minded and letting the problem determine the best solution.

That book achieves the same for ideology.

There are lots to learn from old ideologies, but none are complete. They must be mixed and matched according to their strengths and weaknesses. Like in medicine or Ultimate Fighting, any ideological technique must be evaluated based on evidence of their results and not ideological purity.

To mix and match ideolgies today, we must break their echo chambers. They were once needed to foster many different ideologies, but the time comes when disciplines must acknowledge they are sub-discplines in the service of a greater goal; i.e. solving real-life problems.

This enlightnment has a big obstacle. People's political emotions are so strong today. Ideological pundits, teachers, commentators tell great stories. To escape their spell, we must understand the amazing magic of storytelling.

## The Story of Cinderella

The classic fairytale is about a orphaned country girl living with her step family. Pretty, hard-working, and humble, Cinderella spends her days doing grueling house work because her step mother is cruel towards her. The stepmother favours her own two daughters, and thus when a gallant ball is held to help a handsome prince find a wife, Cinderella isn't allowed to attend, and must watch her two stepsisters go to the ball.

When her fairy godmother arrives with magic in hand, Cinderella gets the chance to visit the royal ball herself.

Using a false name the shy girl dazzles the gallant prince. But the spell that brought her to the ball soon ends, forcing the shy Cinderella to leave the prince with nothing but a glass slipper to remember her by.

Heartbroken, the prince orders his allies to search the country for the unknown girl who fits the glass slipper.

The search eventually gets to the house of Cinderella. The evil stepmother has gotten wise that her stepdaigher is the prince's heartthrob, and so locks her in the attic. Being the lovable girl she is, the house staff rescue their beloved friend. Cinderella escapes in time to ask the prince's men if she can try on the glass slipper. But, just as she's about to, the evil stepmother breaks it.

To which Cinderella responds by revealing she has the other slipper.

And the rest is history.

The movie _Cinderella_ was very popular when it was released. It's popular today. And it'll be popular hundreds of years from now. People will always like it because it's a great story.

People love stories, we can't get enough of them.  A good story lets us experience the trials, lessons, and drama of another person's experience. Stories let us live many different lives.

Stories are so powerful because they are complete reality's. Everything in real life has a representation in a story. Props fill the storyworld with items from beds to stables. They have music to relay the emotions of their characters. The dialogue communicates what each character wants in a easy to understand way. Then there's the villain who earns their name because he defends the world they way it is and doesn't want anything to change. Next comes the philosophy of the world the story is set in. The philosophy dictates the rules everyone in the story is supposed to live by, for example Cinderella is supposed to obey her step-mother. After that is the hero, who disreards the ruling philosphy and envisions a better world. And at the top of this story pyramid is the tools; the levers of power that determine who controls the story world.

These elements are all needed in a story because they are our everyday reality. The magic of good storytelling is to combine all this elements so well that the audience is transfixed. Watch a person enjoying a good story and there engrossed, and jump, scream, cry as if the story is real.

And that brings us to echo chambers. To understand the difference between echo chambers and reality is to realize the story of Cinderella isn't about the girl controlled by her evil step-family. It's also not a story about a girl overcoming her evil step-family to marry her prince charming.

The story of Cinderella is about a girl overcoming her step-family using tools.

If Cinderella doesn't get the horses, carriage, and evening dress from her fairy godmother, she'll never get into the ball. If the prince didn't find her lost slipper, she'd never see him again. If her allies didn't steal the key to the attic, she'd never get out. And if Cinderella didn't have the second glass slipper, the story of _Cinderella_ would be a tragedy instead of a fairy tale.

Cinderella had a problem, and it wasn't that her step-family were terrible people, it was that her terrible step-family controlled tools and Cinderella didn't.

The drama of the story is the battle over tools. From the tickets to the royal ball, to the famous glass slipper, _Cinderella_ is a battle over tools because tools are the lever of power in every story.

In everything story, the villian controls the tools and uses the ruling philosophy to justify their control. The hero suffers an injustice that lets them see through the BS of the ruling philosophy. The drama of the story is whether or not the hero will seize control of the tools, implement their own philsophy, and thus improve the world. 

If you were to draw our Cinderlla, this is what it looks like.

Starting Reality
Cinderella's Desired Reality
Back and forth battle over tools
New reality

The important thing to remember when destrouing echo chmabers is that philosophies are sub-serviant to tools.

## Each Tool Has Its Own Philosophy

We're already discussed how each martial art has specific techniques. Boxing has punching, wrestling man-control, and so on. Each of these techniques adapt the human body to perform a task. And in that way martial arts turn the human body into a different tool.

As we just learned, each tool has a philosophy behind it.

Boxing is about aggresive hitting, punching combinations, and footwork. Jiu-jitsu is about patience, durability, and seizing openings. Wrestling is hard training with endless reptitions. These are the philsophies needed to hardness the respective techniques of each sport.

What echo chambers can't do, is change tools, because the tools we use determine the philosophy we believe in. This is why old martial arts were so scared of mixed-martial arts. They were limited to the techniques that they knew, and as a sub-discipline they weren't free to mix and match tools as needed, because each tool has a different philosophy attached to it.

Boxing is about heavy hitting, punching combinations, and footwork. Jiu-jitsu is about patience, durability, and seizing openings. Wrestling is hard training with endless reptitions. These are the philsophies needed to hardness the respective techniques of each sport.

For example, think of Cinderella locked inside that attic. The prince's men are so close, and if she can just get outside and try on the glass slipper her horrible life will change forever; if her friends can get the key. But if they'd failed getting the key, and instead brough back a match?

Now the oppressed girl has some soul searching to do, because the the philsophy behind buring the house down, even to earn her freedom, is a different philosophy then getting some friends to steal a key.

Because tools determine philosophy. 

This is also why, when facing a problem ideologies default to the same solutions. One side always wants government control, while another ideology wants corporate control.



based their reality on their real-world results, because they want the philosophy to rule supreme.

The beauty of mixed-martial arts, modern medicine, and any field that selects its techniques, tools, applications based on the problem, is they are always free. Free to remove the old tool, grab new tool.

The different between an echo chamber, is simply to ask their storytellers to change the tool. They won't be able to do it. They sell and earn their money, prestiage, on knowing a limited set of techniques and tools. To let the problem determine the best solution is to threaten a freedom of tools, and therefore threatens their self-image of being leaders.




## Evolution

echo chambers helped invent the options we select from. This is how Evolution works too. Life continuosly makes new species, it's the most practical ones that survive. Human evolution mimicks natural evolution.

But unlike Nature, we can select our own options. Once we have an enlightenment philosophy to transition people from being loyal members of a discipline, to selecting from these options based on their effectiveness in solving a problem.

This enlightnment thus requires breaking from echo chamber. Which we can do by understanding the magic of storytelling.
