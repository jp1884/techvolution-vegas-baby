# A World With No Majic

Life wants many different lifeforms. High biodiveristy empowers life to better respond to environment changes. Evolution makes it happen.

Human evolution, what I call Techvolution, is interrupted by Darth Blockbuster. He uses rules to distract people from their love of majically teaching and learning new tools. This sucks for extras and protagonists. But it's absolutely horrible for society.

Because we don't evolve to our environment. Digtal tools burst onto our world in in the 1970's. The 1970's is when the transitor, integrated circuit, microchip, internet were cheap enough to let protagonists create new tools. The extras should have been selecting new tools to combate road traffic, expensive education, incomprehsible health insurance plans, and so forth.

Instead, Darth Blockbuster kept writing rules to protect his pre-digital tools of huge tax codes, books, broadcasting, and lecture halls.

Now our society is hurting. Predicatably, since the 1970's our politics and climate have gone to shit. Looks at these trends.

## Frontline

Red blue politics used old ruling philosophies. One's based on limited tools, and trying to figure out how to "fairly" allocate the control, regulation, and profits of society's limited tools. Who should get into University, and how should it be paid, is an easy example.

Without changing their ruling philosophy, our politics is unable to work together. They increasingly blamed each other for their shared inability to update society to the new environment of digital tools.

That means our society is forced to us use pre-digital tools. Mass produced gas cars and inefficient suburban housing, used by millions stuck in traffic going to and from 9-5 jobs. Our climate is changing because our ruling philosophy is not.

A date ruling philosophy causes more problems on the frontline. Incomprehensible tax codes that keep legons of accounts and lawyers employed. Education system charging teenagers tens of thousands of dollars. A banking industry ready to load kids the money because the rules say kids can never declare bankruptcy on it. Highways citizens keep paying to expand, yet commute times keep getting longer.

The people are disadvantaged. Our problem isn't lack of innovation per se. It's lack of majic, because the extras are held back from connecting to new tools, because of the rules. Middle class quality of life, political cooperation, and climate change, won't get better until the extras join the antagonists in stepping up to the antagonists, and change the world.
