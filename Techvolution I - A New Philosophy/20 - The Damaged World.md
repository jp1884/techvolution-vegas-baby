# A World With No Majic

Evolution lets life react to a changing environment. The faster life reacts the better. Human evolution is interrupted by Darth Blockbuster. He doesn't want extras can't freely deciding which tools they want to use. This sucks for extras and protagonists. But it's fucking horrible for society.

Because since the creation of digital technology in the 1970 we've barely adapted. Instead, Darth Blockbuster keeps writing more rules to protect his pre-digital tools of books, broadcasting, and lecture halls.

Now our society is hurting. It's not surprise since the 1970's our politics and climate have gone to shit. Looks at these trends. Red blue politics, based on pre-digital tools, has increasingly blamed each other for their shared inability to improve society using digital tools. And without new tools, our environment is left baring the burden of gas cars, mass commuting, suburban housing, and 9-5 jobs. No suprise, these tools make up the red / blue ideal lifestyle of pre-digital 1950's, 1960's America.

Look at this trends Skywalker.

## Frontline

Our world's in a bad state. And it wont get better until we fight back.  The view from the frontline is the same.

The people are disadvantaged. We deal with problems, from small pots on our roads, to waiting on hold with our health insurance. Workers expect to get outsourced by bosses so busy looking up to the prince, they don't even know what the job at the bottom is.

Our problem isn't lack of innovation. It's lack of majic. Extras are held back from connecting to new tools, and evolving life. Quality of life, political hatred, climate change, won't get better until the heroes step up to the antagonists.
