# A World With No Majic

Skywalker, the empire is evil. They don't mean to be mean, but they are. They use their Death Star of a rule book to keep their tools in power. From contracts nobody can understand, to regulations nobody reads. Our society's biggest problems like personal isolation, politicla hatred, and climate change, are wounds by the Death Star's own laser blasts.

We need Techvolution and it's Lifestar to fight back. Remember Techvolution mimicks nature, where life makes biodiverity to better adapt to environmental changes. In nature no one says evolution is against the rules. The only natural rule is natural selection.

Because we evolve with tools, we need the same freedom to choose. We already have protagonists creating new tools to solve frontline problems. We already have extras feeling the pain of frontline problems. What we don't have is the freedom of extras to majically form bonds with new tools, nor can we easily convince them to join our cause.

Because our natural Techvolution is interrupted by Darth Blockbuster. He takes hold of society's ruling philosophy, and uses it to make rules that intimidate extras. This sucks for extras and protagonists. But it's absolutely horrible for society. Especially ours today.

The Death Star has been busy since the 1970's. That's when protagonists created digital tools en masse, and Darth Blockbuster showed up to stop the majic of extras using them to change society. Look at the affects on our personal isolation, politics, and climate.

## Things Won't Change, Until

Things can't change if our tools and politics stay the same. Most of our problems started in the 1970's for a reason. That's when protagonists's created digital tools, and Darth Blockbuster showed up to keep our car driving, suburban living, 9-5 working, unhealthy food eating, univeristy admission test taking lifestyle going. Despite totally new tools, the American way of life hasn't changed. It's still the "American Dream" to live in a post World War II baby boomer suburb.

Thus, red / blue politics fight old fights. They fight to "fairly" allocate the control, regulation, and profit, of limited tools. For example, because university libraries and lecture halls are still considered "formal education", red / blue endlessly debate who should get into university and how the masive expense should be paid. Endless battles over affirmative action, student loan rates, and state education subsidies are the result.

While answers are ignore. Digital tools like Wikipedia, YouTube, Khan Academy, Udemy, Skillshare, Brilliant, The Great Courses, can educate anyone willing. Yet we don't recognize that fact. We don't teach kids to read or update Wikipedia. We don't track their progress in Khan Academy's micro-lessons. We don't "graduate" based on knowlege, but on years of service. We defintely don't recognize "degrees" from Udemy, or YouTube, even though most programmers learn far more there, then in any college classroom.

Blue / red politicians increasingly blame each other for a non functioning society. Frontline problems go unsolved, the blame going back and forth like a hot potato. Darth Blockbuster is happy. Old philosphies and political deadlock means he can keep adding rules to keep the extras away from new tools, and keep using his pre-digital tools.

And thus our society suffers. Despite too much carbon in the atmostphere, housing bubble bursts, massive student debt, and horrible individual health, we keep living the same way, under the rules of a aged ruling philosophy, with rules written by antagonists. Worst, our climate is changing because our ruling philosophy is not.

Middle class quality of life, political cooperation, and climate change, won't get better until the extras join the protagonists, step-up to the antagonists, and change their ruling philosophy. Only then will the world change. Our world stays damaged, waiting for Techvolution.
