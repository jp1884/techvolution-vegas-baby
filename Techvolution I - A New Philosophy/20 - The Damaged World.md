# A World With No Majic

Life wants biodiveristy. Evolution is life's tool to get it. Lots of lifeforms empower's life to better respond to frontline problem when the environment changes. Biological evolution takes time, but at least there's no one saying its wrong. The only natural rule is natural selection.

Humanity evolves with tools. Protagonists experience frontine problems, and create new tools to solve them. Extras feel the pain of frontline problems, and majic makes them love the work of learning and teaching new tools. We call this Techvolution.

Yet Techvolution is interrupted by Darth Blockbuster. He takes hold of society's ruling philosophy, and uses it to make rules that intimidate extras, and thereby thwart new tools from getting used, and improving the world. This sucks for extras and protagonists. But it's absolutely horrible for society. Especially ours today.

Because extras are not naturally selecting their own tools. So we are not adapting to our environment, like personal isolation, political hatred, and climate change. All these are symptons of a ruling philosophy increasingly out of date since the 1970's. That's when protagonists created digital tools en masse, and Darth Blockbuster showed up to stop the majic of extras using them to change society.

Look at the affects on our personal isolation, politics, and climate.

## Frontline

Most of our problems started in the 1970's. That's when protagonists's created digital tools, and Darth Blockbuster showed up to keep our car driving, suburban living, 9-5 working, unhealthy food eating, univeristy admission test taking, lifestyle going. Despite totally new tools, the American way of life hasn't changed. It's still the "American Dream" to live in a post World War II baby boomer suburb.

Our politics also the same. Using old philosophies, red / blue politics fight to "fairly" allocate the control, regulation, and profit, of limited tools. For example, because university libraries and lecture halls are still considered "formal education", red / blue endlessly debate who should get into university, and how the masive expense should be paid. Endless battles over affirmative action, student loan rates, state subsidies are the result.

The great power of digital tools to empower everyone is ignored. Wikipedia, YouTube, Khan Academy, Udemy, Skillshare, Brilliant, The Great Courses, and so much more can educate anyone willing. Yet we don't recognize that fact, because our ruling philosophy survices on the battles over limited tools.

Our politics thus can't work. Blue / red politicians increasingly blame each other for a non functioning society. Frontline problems go unsolved, the blame going back and forth like a hot potato.

Darth Blockbuster is happy. Old philosphies and political deadlock means he can keep adding rules keep the extras away from the majic of new tools, and use keeps using his pre-digital tools.

And thus our society suffers. Despite too much carbon in the atmostphere, housing bubble bursts, massive student debt, and horrible individual health, we keep living the same way, under the rules of a aged ruling philosophy, with rules written by antagonists. We abuse Earth's resources. Our climate is changing because our ruling philosophy is not.

Middle class quality of life, political cooperation, and climate change, won't get better until the extras join the protagonists, step-up to the antagonists, and change their ruling philosophy. Only then will the world change. Our world stays damaged, waiting for Techvolution.
