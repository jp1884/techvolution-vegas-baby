# A World With No Majic

Life wants biodiveristy. Evolution is life's tool to get it. Lots of lifeforms empowers life to better respond to frontline problem when the environment changes. Biological evolution takes time, but at least there's no one saying its wrong. The only natural rule is natural selection.

Humanity evolves with tools via Techvolution. Protagonists experience frontine problems, and creat new tools to solve them. Extras feel the pain of frontline problems, and majic makes them love the work of learning and teaching new tools.

Yet Techvolution is interrupted by Darth Blockbuster. He takes hold of society's ruling philosophy, and uses it to make rules that intimidate extras, and thereby thwart new tools from improving the world. This sucks for extras and protagonists. But it's absolutely horrible for society. Especially ours.

Because extras aren't naturally selecting their own tools, we haven't been adapting our environment. Our society's many problems, like personal isolation, political hatred, climate change, all started in the 1970's as a result. That's when protagonists created digital tools en masse. And its when Darth Blockbuster showed up to stop the majic of extras using them to change society.

Look at the affects on our politics and climate.

## Frontline

Most of our problems started in the 1970's. Protagonists's created digital tools, Darth Blockbuster showed up to keep our car driving, suburban living, 9-5 working, unhealthy food eating, univeristy admission test taking, era of mass production going. Despite totally new tools, the American way of life hasn't changed. It's still the "American Dream" to live in a post World War II baby boomer suburb.

Our politics is thus also the same. Red / blue politics happily use old philosophies. Both trying to figure out how to "fairly" allocate the control, regulation, and profit of society's limited tools. For example, because university libraries and lecture halls are still considered "formal education", red / blue still to debate who should get into university, and how the masive expense should be paid. Endless battles over affirmative action, student loan rates, state subsidies are the result.

The great power of digital tools is ignored, especially in education. Sticking with old philosophies holds them back. Our politics thus can't work. Politicians increasingly blame each other for their shared inability to update society to digital tools. Frontline problems go unsolved. Red blames blue and vice versa in an vicious cycle.

Darth Blockbuster is happy. Political deadlock means our society is forced to keep using his pre-digital tools.

And thus our climate suffers. We keep using Darth Blockbuster's mass produced gas cars, college education, inefficient cookie cutter suburban housing, unnutrious fast food. Despite frontline problems of too much carbon in the atmostphere, housing bubble bursts, massive student debt, and horrible individual health. We overuse Earth's resources. Our climate is changing because our ruling philosophy is not.

The people suffer. Middle class quality of life, political cooperation, and climate change, won't get better until the extras join the protagonists, step-up to the antagonists, and change their ruling philosophy. Only then will the world change.
