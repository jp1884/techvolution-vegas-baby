# A World With No Majic

Evolution lets life react to a changing environment. The faster life reacts the better. Human evolution is interrupted by Darth Blockbuster. He doesn't want extras freely deciding their own tools. This sucks for extras and protagonists. But it's fucking horrible for society.

Because since the creation of digital technology in the 1970 we've barely adapted. Instead, Darth Blockbuster keeps writing more rules to protect his pre-digital tools of books, broadcasting, and lecture halls.

Now our society is hurting. It's no surprise since the 1970's our politics and climate have gone to shit. Looks at these trends. Red blue politics, based on pre-digital tools, has increasingly blamed each other for their shared inability to improve society using digital tools. Forced to use pre-digital tools, our environment is left baring the burden of gas cars, mass commuting, suburban housing, and 9-5 jobs.

## Frontline

The view from the frontline is the same. Incomprehensible tax codes that keep legons of accounts and lawyers employed. Education system chargeing teenagers tens of thousands of dollars. A banking industry ready to load kids the money because the rules say kids can never declare bankruptcy on it. Highways citizens keep paying to expand, yet commute times keep getting longer.

The people are disadvantaged. Our problem isn't lack of innovation. It's lack of majic. Extras are held back from connecting to new tools, and evolving life. Quality of life, political hatred, climate change, won't get better until the heroes step up to the antagonists.
