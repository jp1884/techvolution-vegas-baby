# A World With No Majic

Life wants biodiveristy. Evolution is life's tool to get it. Lots of lifeforms empowers life to better respond to frontline problem when the environment changes. Biological evolution takes time, but at least there's no one saying its wrong. The only natural rule is natural selection.

Humanity evolves with tools via Techvolution. Protagonists experience frontine problems, and invent new tools to solve them. Extras feel the pain of frontline problems, and majic makes them love the work of learning and teaching new tools.

Yet Techvolution is interrupted by Darth Blockbuster. He takes hold of society's ruling philosophy, and uses it to make rules that distract extras, and thwart new tools from improving the world. This sucks for extras and protagonists. But it's absolutely horrible for society. Especially ours today.

Without extras naturally selecting their own tools, we haven't been adapting our changing environment. Our society's many problems, like personal isolation, political hatred, climate change, all started in the 1970's. That's when digital tools were created en masse. And when Darth Blockbuster showed up.

Look at the affects on our politics and climate.

## Frontline

Red blue politics use old philosophies. One's trying to figure out how to "fairly" allocate the control, regulation, and profits of society's limited tools. For example, when libraries and lecture halls were the only means of education, old philosophies needed to debate who should get into university, and how  the masive expense should be paid. Endless battles over affirmative action, student loan rates, state subsidies are the result.

Digital tools greatly open up our options. Sticking with old philosophies holds them back. Our politics thus can't work. Politicians increasingly blame each other for their shared inability to update society to digital tools. Frontline problems go unsolved. Red blames blue and vice versa in an vicious cycle.

Darth Blockbuster is happy as our society is forced to keep using his pre-digital tools.

And thus our climate suffers. We keep using Darth Blockbuster's mass produced gas cars, college education, inefficient cookie cutter suburban housing, unnutrious fast food. Despite frontline problems of too much carbon in the atmostphere, housing bubble bursts, massive student debt, and horrible individual health. We overuse Earth's resources. Our climate is changing because our ruling philosophy is not.

The people are disadvantaged. Middle class quality of life, political cooperation, and climate change, won't get better until the extras join the antagonists in stepping up to the antagonists, and change the world.
