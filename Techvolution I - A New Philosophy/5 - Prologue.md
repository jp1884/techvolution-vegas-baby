# Heroes Reach for the Tools

We’ve come quite a way in the story Stargazer. Let’s take a minute and answer some questions you might be thinking.

First off, a new ruling philosophy doesn’t mean you throw away all the old stuff. Old philosophies, red/blue among them, will always teach us lessons that help us do our jobs better as well as enlighten our personal opinions. Old philosophies just should not be our ruling philosophy today because they're not created with digital tools in mind.

Techvolution is. It helps us make the best use of digital tools. Let me explain how it can be our ruling political philosophy by using the microcosm of politics that is hand to hand fighting.

Humanity has many martial arts: karate, kickboxing, wrestling, jiu-jitsu, judo, and boxing being among the most popular. Each martial art adapts the human body with specific techniques such as punching or choke-holds and make rules so only these techniques are allowed during competition; there’s no kicking in a boxing match for example.

In the early 1990’s the martial arts community got curious and wondered who would win a real fight. On reflection, it seems funny that this was an original idea, but before the 1990’s people just assumed boxers or wrestlers could not fight outside their rulebook. All fighters were supposed to be ideologically loyal to their techniques and sing to their choirs about being the best, even if getting their ass kicked in a real fight.

When the martial art community threw away their rule books and held many “no rules” tournaments, there were fittingly rewarded with a clear answer. The best martial art was none of them; or all of them. Meaning the best fighters were ones who trained all techniques and used the ones they thought would defeat their opponent based on the exact moment they were fighting them. A large toolbox of techniques and an open mind to adapt proved to be the best martial art. Embracing the “rulelessness” of evolution was the start of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA). And while boxers still punch the best, and kickboxers kick the best, evolution empowered MMA fighters still beat them in a street fight.

Red/blue ideologies are like non-MMA martial arts. They teach a limited number of techniques and limit themselves to their own rule book. However, in their area of expertise, from monetary policy to farm regulation, they have a huge reservoir of know-how. This single book can't replace all that knowledge. That would be laughable to suggest.

But we still need a new ruling philosophy. Because when the digital revolution came it gave humanity a sudden explosion of new tools, enabling a huge amount of “techniques” or adaptions to use in our evolution that old philosophies never thought about.

You can think of Techvolution as “mixed philosophical politics”. A person is free to study and believe in old philosophies, but no one should think the rule books of old philosophies determine right and wrong when up against the right to evolve on the frontline. Because to evolve humanity, we the people on the frontline--the people in the real fight—need the freedom to decide which tool best solves a problem. The right to evolve should trump all other considerations. Letting people whose positions are based on old tools the right to decide on technological upgrades is a recipe for inaction.

Importantly, since Techvolution is a hallowed right it must also be a responsibility. Here are some tools waiting for the middle class problems to grab hold of today.

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation recently funded TerraPower, a new nuclear reactor fueled by depleted uranium. Among many other reasons, because they could use supercomputers to design it, TerraPower made nuclear power much safer. Bill and Melinda Gates hopes their reactors will keep the world's lights on for generations; but even they can’t fund it all. Should we tell our governments too? I don’t know, I’m no expert. But breathing in smog and ejecting greenhouse gases into the air is hardly a good thing. Maybe we should be pushing for TerraPower when electing our government; maybe not. But it’s something to think about.

3D printers are like inkjet printers, except they fuse small particles together and thus can print 3D objects; even ones as complicated as a violin. They’re very common in industrial prototyping and regular people could use them to print lost buttons, toy action figures imagined by kids, or hand tools custom designed for our specific needs. The best part of 3D printers is there's no factories, cargo ships, marketing, or retail stores needed. We can just print whatever we need on demand. Sadly, most people have never even seen a 3D printer never-mind bought one of its printed products. It’s a shame we should fix quickly.

I didn’t draw any of this book’s illustrations. I’ve also never met the artists who did, or even spoken with them. Instead I used paint.net to edit photos and put them together in design software called Figma. Then I found illustrators via online marketplaces and said “please draw me this”. Within days I had the illustrations I needed. Today anyone can work with experts to write computer code, or design a custom 3D printed hand tool. All with no job interviews, management oversight, or upfront cost. Online collaboration is that easy; once we think to look for it.

As said before, the Woodstock era lifestyle no longer applies. Middle class people can’t just one job and assume the government or the market will solve all our problems. Employment isn’t for life anymore and Woodstock era pre-digital tools aren’t good enough to solve today’s problems.

Digital tools are. They empower regular people to lower their cost of living and earn income themselves. The three examples above are just a snippet. These so many other new digital tools waiting for the middle-class to use (of course most use open-source technologies). Regular people searching for digital tools is the rebellion inside our mind the world needs because real life isn’t a red/blue ideological fight any more than a street fight is a boxing match. And that’s why Techvolution should be our ruling philosophy.

In short, Techvolution says be selfish! You’re a lifeform like any other. Your job is to adapt to make your own life better. And humans adapt with tools. So, go find the tools you need to life a better life.

Unfortunately, controlling tools is the nature of all political battles. Whether in galaxies far far away, street fights in parking lots, wars between nations, or your own life. It’s why antagonists so often make new tools against the rules. And why I needed to write a book to remind everyone rules are supposed to serve human evolution; not get its way. But since they do Stargazer we must get political, pack our bags, rally our friends, get on the ship and get ready; because now we have to blow up a Death Star.
