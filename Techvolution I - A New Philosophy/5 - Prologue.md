# Heroes Reach for the Tools

We’ve come quite a way in the story Stargazer. Let’s take a minute and answer some questions you might be thinking.

First off, a new ruling philosophy doesn’t mean you throw away all the old stuff. For example, Aristotle’s work, even his science stuff, is extremely insightful and valuable to think about. All old philosophies, red/blue among them, will always teach us many lessons that motivate our personal opinions. Today, they just should not be our ruling philosophy because they're not created with digital tools in mind.

Techvolution is. Let me explain how it can be our ruling political philosophy using an example from martial arts.

Humanity has many martial arts: karate, kickboxing, wrestling, jiu-jitsu, judo, and boxing being among the most popular. Each of these teach specific techniques such as punching or choke-holds. Each also says only their techniques are allowed during their competitions; there’s no kicking in a boxing match for example.

In the early 1990’s the martial arts community asked who would win a real fight. On reflection, it seems funny that this was an original idea, but before the 1990’s people just assumed boxers or wrestlers weren’t allowed to fight outside their rulebook. All fighters were supposed to be ideologically loyal to their techniques, even if getting their ass kicked in a real fight.

The martial art community held many “no rules” tournaments and found the best martial art. The answer was none of them; or all of them. Meaning the best fighters were ones who trained all techniques and used the ones they thought would defeat their opponent based on the exact moment they were fighting them. A large toolbox of techniques and an open mind to adapt proved to be the best martial art. This realization was the start of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA). And while boxers still punch the best, and kickboxers kick the best, MMA is so potent its practitioners defeat any other kind of fighter.

Red/blue ideologies are like non-MMA martial arts. They teach a limited number of techniques and limit themselves to their own rule book. However, in their area of expertise, from monetary policy, to farm regulation, there's a huge library of expertise. This single book can't replace all that knowledge. That would be laughable to suggest.

But with the digital revolution, humanity has a huge burst of new tools. And to make use of them, we need the people in the ring, the people on the frontline, to decide which is good for what problem. Giving people whose positions nad power is based on old tools that choice is a recipe for inaction.

You can think of Techvolution as “mixed philosophical politics”. Like an MMA fighter can learn from a kickboxer, we can still learn from past philosophies. But like kickboxing, past philosophies can’t be the ruling philosophy because they see their rule book as the answer to all problems.

Digital tools are so versatile and cheap they let every person by a "MMA fighter". When given the freedom to use whatever tool we think will solve your problem at the exact moment we're having it, we'll prosper because a large toolbox and an open mind to adapt is the most potent evolution. Here are some tools waiting to solve our problems today.

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation recently funded TerraPower, a new nuclear reactor fueled by depleted uranium. Among many other reasons, because they could use supercomputers to design it, TerraPower made nuclear power much safer. Bill Gates hopes his reactors will keep the world's lights on for generations. Should we us it? I don’t know, I’m no expert. But breathing in smog and ejecting greenhouse gases into the air is hardly a good thing. New power generations tools like TerraPower are out there. We should be looking for them.

3D printers are like inkjet printers, except they fuse together small particles, and thus can print 3D objects; even ones as complicated as a violin. They’re very common in industrial prototyping, but regular people could use them to print lost buttons, toy action figures imagined by kids, or hand tools custom designed for our specific needs. The best part of 3D printers is there's no factories, cargo ships, marketing, or retail stores are needed. We can just print whatever we need when needed. Sadly, most people have never even seen a 3D printer never-mind bought one of its printed products. It’s a shame we should fix quickly.

I didn’t draw any of this book’s illustrations. I’ve also never met the artists who did, or even spoken with them. Instead I used paint.net to edit photos and put them together in design software called Figma. Then I found illustrators via online marketplaces and said “please draw me this”. Within days I had the illustrations I needed. Today anyone can work with experts to write computer code, or design a 3D hand tool. All with no job interviews, management oversight, or upfront cost. Online collaboration is that easy; once we think to look for it.

These are just some of the many new digital tools waiting for the middle-class to grab hold of (and of course most of these tools use open-source technologies).

Searching for digital tools is the rebellion inside your mind the world needs because real life isn’t a red/blue ideological fight any more than a street fight is a boxing match.

In short, Techvolution says be selfish! You’re a lifeform like any other. Your job is to adapt, and humans adapt with tools. So go find the tools you need to life a better life. Controlling tools is also the nature of all political battles. Whether in galaxies far far away, street fights in parking lots, wars between nations, or your own life. It’s why antagonists so often make new tools against the rules.

Nobody benefits in the long run when evolution is held back. Not even the antagonists. Yet we’ve all seen antagonists do their thing and disallow telecommuting, waste hours on garbage meetings, or ban electric cars. Until we start to call out “Darth Blockbuster” middle-class problems will continue to pile-up. The tools we need to prosper are out there Stargazer. To use them we must reach for them. To be sure nobody stands in our way; we must pack our bags, gather our friends, and blow up the Death Star.
