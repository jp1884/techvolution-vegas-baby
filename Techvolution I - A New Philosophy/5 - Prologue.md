# Prologue

I wrote this for the people on GitHub, Udemy, Slack, Firefox, Sketch and whatever else you Jedi are working on. Learning your ecosystem of new tools was cool. Learning your unspoken philosophy was even cooler.

Most people don't comprehend the power of your tools and the open-source philosophy that builds them. It's too different. The fact any person can download from GitHub, learn on YouTube, get help on StackOverflow, and bam, have their own _whatever they want_ is a totally new world. One where Cinderella gets invited to the ball because everyone is always invited to have fun.

Open-source is a palace without guards. It wants everyone to join, because when people are treated with respect, it knows everyone has something to contribute. Empowered people naturally debate ideas, work together, and share results. Open-source isn't perfect; some people are dicks, projects die off, politics gets involved. But that's humanity. Only by trusting in us do we invent new tools that empower our strenghths to fight off our drawbacks.

Learning open-source tools feels amazing. I'm a lone philosophy, politics, and history geek who spends his days thinking about political philosophy. Yet, like so many individuals, I can use tools like VS Code, and Ghost to host my own work. Using Word and Figma I can collaborate with world class illustrators and writers to illustrate and edit it. No paying off middleman. Workers themselves have the power to create and collaborate at their own fingertips. It's the only reason why this book is illustrated and edited so well while being accessible from anywhere on Earth.

Open-source still can’t run the world. In _The Innovators_ Walter Isaacson explains how the trifecta of militaries, academic institutions, and private corporations created the digital revolution. Likewise, it was for profit companies, academic institutions, and open-source programmers who kept it going.

But open-source is the next step in human evolution. It’s so pivotal because it’s a check against middleman making gates to get into the party. With open-source these Darth Blockbusters couldn’t stop a few hackers from giving the world internet streaming. An upgrade that saved society billions of needless miles picking up and dropping off our movies, shows, and documentaries.

Yet open-source struggles. Organizations like Wikipedia, Mozilla, Ghost, channels like Real Engineering, CodeCademy, and Traversy Media; and the thousands making new programs often need donations just to keep going. All while old tools like universities, television broadcasters, and movie studios get subsidies, tax credits, and bail outs.

This difference signifies our society's great divide; middleman fighting to keep themselves in power with society's money, while open-source makes new tools that usurp them and distribute that money to the people.

At first I only wanted to learn about open-source's fight. Now I want to unite you. There’s no difference between the soldiers who fought Darth King George III and you, the modern minuteman who work so regular people can control their own lives and better their families.

You all feel the “majic” of new tools but have a hard time explaining why. Humanity still doesn’t really understand how our “cyborgology” changes us every time we pick up a radio, a smartphone, or a lightsaber (one day!). With Techvolution, people will know why open-source are the good guys. Terms like “Darth Blockbuster”, “Death Star rule book”, “internet Jedi”, make the world easier to understand for a struggling middle class person praying for some help.

We need a new philosophy to get there. Neither regular people or open-source will go anywhere with typical "red/blue" politics. These philosphies are very outdated. Their believers march and yell like its Woodstock in 1969, because technologically speaking they love 1969. Gas cars, nightly newscasts, 9-5 work days, two car garages; their ideal way of life is a never ending _Simpsons_ episode. Open-source can't use these philosophies to change the world. You're not going to flower-power your way past the future's antagonists.

Because there are many Darth Blockbuster’s in its way. And it's you _versus_ them. They live to make people use their old tools like DVDs, road maps, lecture halls, paper insurance forms, and call-centers. They fear open-source tools sending them back to equality. They do so with the outmost sincerity and conviction that they’re the “martyrs of the people”. The power of digital tools is as lost to them as books, guns, and telescopes was to Darth King. Although they’re usually very well-intentioned people, they can't accept a new era has come.

Like fans of an aging sitcom, the people are too distracted to notice our aging philosophy. We've all seen the same political family names, cable news shows, 60 Minute interviews, car commercials, fantasy football leagues to notice open-source new tools can replace our old and suffering economy and empower the middle class to new heights.

However the distractions are dying off. Everytime a regular person has yet another problem with their tax forms, car radiator, ashphalt shingles, or whatever old tool the antagonists are keeping alive, is the moment the pain of living on the frontline makes regular people search for a better way to live.

This moment is where I want to return the favour and empower open-source. Beause this is where all its coders, designers, testers, contributors can gain a member by saying "I am part of the open-source movement inventing new tools to solve problems like this... and we need your help... because someone is holding us all back".

And when the regular person asks what they heck you're talking about, you can tell them to read Techvolution, then go back to changing the world.
