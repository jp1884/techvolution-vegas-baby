# Prologue

I wrote this for the people on GitHub, Udemy, Slack, VS Code, Sketch, and whatever else you Jedi are working with. Learning your ecosystem of amazing new tools was cool. Learning your unspoken philosophy was even cooler. That's why I worked hard to put it into words. Regular people should understand who should be leading our society.

Regular people don't comprehend the power of your digital tools. Like an animal just released into a new ecosystem, it’s too different. The fact any person can visit GitHub, go to the Ruby on Rails repository, download it for free, put in a few weeks of work, and all of a sudden own their your own newspaper, television station, or call centre is a world as different as Cinderella walking into the ball simply because she wanted to check it out.

With open-source everyone is similarly welcome, because everyone is valuable. Whether it be Ryan Dahl making Node out of nowhere, a kid correcting a line of code, or an elder reading lines for Common Voice. It's not perfect, some people are dicks, but work anywhere else on the frontline and you'll notice a big difference.

I did. I got to work _with_ world class illustrators and writers for this book because of UpWork, Figma, and 99 Designs. No interviews, phone calls, meetings, or office politics. Digital tools let us collaborate. It's the only reason why a book by a lone history and political philosophy student is illustrated and edited so well.

Open-source still can’t run the world on its own. Read The _Innovators_ and Walter Isaacson will explain how the trifecta of academic institutions, private corporations, and the military created the digital revolution. Likewise, it was for profit companies, academic institutions, and open-source programmers who kept it going.

But open-source is the next step in human evolution. It’s so pivotal because it’s a check against people trying to control human technological advancement. Darth Blockbuster couldn’t stop a few hackers from giving the world internet streaming. A upgrade he forestalled out of self-interest that saved hundreds of millions of dollars and a few hundred lives in saved car accidents alone.

Yet open-source struggles. Organizations like Wikipedia, Mozilla, Ghost; YouTubers like Real Engineering, CodeCademy, and Traversy Media, the millions of programmers on GitHub, and designers on Behance, and countless other contributors of shared knowledge need donations when old tools like universities, banks, and insurance companies get bail outs and subsidies.

As a kid I helped my family clean office buildings, warehouses, and factories. My job was to pick up garbages and blueboxes. A simple job I got done before reading PC Gamer. Blue collar people usually cleaned up after themselves. Offices not so much. They didn't like "working beneath them".

Later on, when I was the working in warehouses, factories, and offices, I saw the same thing. In one office job the cleaners were short staffed. Layers of management spent hours in meetings and eventually emailed out this:

>We are working through some issues with our office garbage pickup. As a result some of our bins have not been emptied. If you see that the bin is full, please refrain from adding more to the bin. Thank you for your patience. I am working on getting this resolved.

At nine I had the problem wrapped up, pun intended.

Funny until you realize people who _want_ to delegate work control huge parts of our economy. Dangersous beause they like old technology because it gives them the stream of problems to manage. And they know digital tools threaten their status.

There are two economies in our society today. One based on heirarchy, delegation, and inequality, and one using digital tools to empower all people, from New York moms repairing iPads, to Kansas farmers making mini hydro-generators, everyone working together and solve working class problems.

Open-source is leading the fight for the good guys. One that I only wanted to learn about. Now I want to liberate. There’s no difference between the soldiers who fought Darth King George III and you, the modern minuteman who doesn’t work for money, but to advance human evolution.

You all feel the “majic” of new tools, yet have a hard time explaining to regular people, because humanity still doesn’t really understand how our “cyborgology” changes us every time we pick up a radio, a smartphone, a lightsaber (one day!).

Another big motivation for me to write this was it pisses me off red / blue politics seeps into your political conversations and thoughts.

Those philosophies are old. Using them to try to change the world is like building mechnical calculators to change the world. That's why red/blue supporters yell so much, they don't know digital tools, and can't use them solve problems and so need to keep people watching the drama, rather than living their own story. The middle class needs to become their own heroes with new tools. Ways to understand how their taxes work, analyze how many frickin regulations there are, and protect their data from being sold to the highest bidder.

My hope is that with Techvolution, you can better explain why open-source is making the world a better place. Terms like “Darth Blockbuster”, “Death Star rule book”, “internet Jedi”, make the world easier to understand. Because in truth regular people shouldn't ask "are you red or blue?", but "are you for or against new tools?".

Avoid the red/blue philosophies. They march like its Woodstock in 1969, because technologically speaking they never want us to move passed 1969. The power of digital tools is completely unknown to them. You could transfer them back in time and they wouldn’t notice. Gas cars, broadcast televisions, 9-5 work days, two car garages homes, retirement savings; their ideal way of life is a never ending _The Simpsons_ episode. Red/blue, equally and without difference, are now self-entitled characters in an art film living a life of banquets and balls.

There are many Darth Blockbuster’s in this class of artists. They live by inheriting the control of DVD stores, accounting companies, insurance brokers, bureaucratic office jobs, and the like. They write rules to protect the hierarchy of old tools sending them back to equality. They do so with the outmost sincerity and conviction that they’re the “martyrs of the people”. The power of digital tools is as lost to them as books, guns, and telescopes was to Darth King. It’s too bad. They’re usually very well-intentioned people who regardless, can't see how behind the times they are.

The people are distracted like fans of an old sitcom to notice we don’t get tools to solve our problems. We’re so use to seeing the same political family names, cable news shows, 60 Minute interviews, new car commercials, fantasy football, to notice our story isn’t a classic one with people overcoming problems anymore.

Until you get their attention.

And this moment is my goal. _I_ want to empower _you_ when you're talking about your job to be able to say with a confident smile "I am empowering you with new tools", before adding "...becomes someone is holding you back".

And when the regular person asks what they heck you're talking about, you can just tell them to read _Techvolution_, and go back to changing the world.
