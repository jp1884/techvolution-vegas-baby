I wrote this for the people on GitHub, Udemy, Slack, Firefox, Sketch and whatever else you Jedi are working on. Learning your ecosystem of new tools was cool. Learning your unspoken philosophy was even cooler.

Most people don't comprehend the power of your tools. It's too different. The fact any person can download from GitHub, learn on YouTube, ask for help on StackOverflow, and bam, have their own _whatever the want_, is new world. One where Cinderella goes to the ball simply because she wanted to go.

Open-source is a palace without guards. It wants everyone to party, because everyone has something to contribute. It knows when people are treated with respect, we debate ideas, work together, and share the results. It's not perfect, some people are dicks, projects die off, politics gets involved. But that's humanity. Only by trusting in us do we lower the bad and empower us all with new tools.

Learning new tools feels amazing. I'm a lone philosophy and history geek. Yet using Word and Figma I can work with world class illustrators and writers. Using Ghost and VS Code I can host my own site. It's the only reason why this book is illustrated and edited so well and so easily accessed.

Open-source still can’t run the world. In _The Innovators_ Walter Isaacson explains how the trifecta of academic institutions, private corporations, and American military created the digital revolution. Likewise, it was for profit companies, academic institutions, and open-source programmers who kept it going.

But open-source is the next step in human evolution. It’s so pivotal because it’s a check against middleman at the party gates. These Darth Blockbusters couldn’t stop a few hackers from giving the world internet streaming. An upgrade that saved society billions of needless miles picking up and dropping off DVDs.

Yet open-source struggles. Organizations like Wikipedia, Mozilla, Ghost, channels like Real Engineering, CodeCademy, and Traversy Media; and the thousands making new programs often need donations just to keep going. All while old tools like universities, television broadcasters, and movie studios get bail outs, tax credits, and subsidies.

This difference signifies our society's great divide; middleman fighting to keep themselves in power while many people in open-source make new tools to usurp them.

At first I only wanted to learn about open-source's fight. Now I want to unite you. There’s no difference between the soldiers who fought Darth King George III and you, the modern minuteman who work so regular people can control their own lives and better their families.

You all feel the “majic” of new tools, yet have a hard time explaining to regular people, because humanity still doesn’t really understand how our “cyborgology” changes us every time we pick up a radio, a smartphone, or a lightsaber (one day!). With Techvolution, people will know why open-source are the good guys. Terms like “Darth Blockbuster”, “Death Star rule book”, “internet Jedi”, make the world easier to understand for middle class hoping for some help.

We need a new philosophy to get there. Neither regular people or open-source will go anywhere with the "red/blue" politics. These philosphies are very outdated. Their believers march and yell like its Woodstock in 1969, because technologically speaking they love 1969. Gas cars, nightly newscasts, 9-5 work days, two car garages; their ideal way of life is a never ending _Simpsons_ episode. Open-source can't use these philosophies to change the world. You're not going to flower-power your way past the future's antagonists.

Because there are many Darth Blockbuster’s in its way. They live to keep old tools like DVDs, road maps, paper forms, and call-centers alive. They fear open-source tools sending them back to equality. They do so with the outmost sincerity and conviction that they’re the “martyrs of the people”. The power of digital tools is as lost to them as books, guns, and telescopes was to Darth King. Although they’re usually very well-intentioned people, they don't want to see a new day rise.

Like fans of an aging sitcom, the people are too distracted to notice our aging philosophy. Too use to seeing the same political family names, cable news shows, 60 Minute interviews, car commercials, fantasy football leagues to notice your new tools can replace our old and suffering economy.

Too distracted, until a regular person is having yet another problem with their taxes, insurance company, car maintenance, or whatever old tool the antagonists are keeping alive.

This moment is where I want to return the favour and empower you. Beause this is the moment we can all say "I am part of the open-source movement inventing new tools to solve problems like this... And we need your help... because someone is holding us all back".

And when the regular person asks what they heck you're talking about, you can tell them to read _Techvolution_. Then go back to changing the world.
