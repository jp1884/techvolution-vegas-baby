# Prologue

I wrote this for the people on GitHub, Wikipedia, Dribbble, Udemy, Stackoverflow, Unsplash, Slack and wherever else you open-source Jedi like to gather. Learning your ecosystem of digital tools was cool. Learning your philosophy was even cooler.

You've change the world. The world just doesn't know it yet. Most people still think stuff like news, manufacturing, and education are only for government or big business. Yet because of you, there's countless tools for _the people_ to control their own products, identity, and lives. It's truly a new world. One where Cinderella goes to the ball simply because... everyone can.

You're like Yoda! I'm being serious. Whether its parents educating their own children on Khan Academy, moms learning from YouTube videos to repair iPads for extra cash, or laid off workers using Rails to make their own app, you've torn down gates and empowered regular people to stop being extras hoping for a better life, and become protagonists making a better life.

I'm one of them. I'm a lone politics, history, and philosophy geek who spends his days thinking about what's next for our civilization. With your tools I can research, write, and host my own work, and even find and collaborate with world-class writers and illustrators to make it better. A few decades ago I'd be hoping a professor or publisher looked my way.

Some like such gates. As a kid I helped my family clean office buildings. I picked up the garbages and blue-bins because it was so easy. Years later when working at a big office, the cleaners were short staffed for a few weeks. Management spent hours meeting about the "garbage problem" instead of just wrapping it up (pun intended) and moving on.

These middleman, managers, and delegators are our gatekeepers. They love to hold tickets and manage who'll "get access" to big companies, univeristies, and bureaucracies. An entire class of consultants, managers, and executives whose skill isn't nursing, teaching, and (definitely not) cleaning, but delegating "down" while looking to "rise up" a corporate heirarchy whose power comes from controlling the gates of old technology. New technology is a threat.

It's night and day comparing this world to open-source. It's members are peers who manage each other because there's no positions, copyrights, or patents to fight over. It's open-source after all; everything is shared, so why fight and harm the product you're using yourself. Gates are the enemy to the future you want to build.

Not that open source can run the world. Some people are rude, project die off, politics gets involved. In _The Innovators_ and Walker Isaacson explains how the trifecta of academia, corporations, and militaries were perfect to create the digital revolution. Likewise, it was government, enterprise, and open-source that worked to keep it going. Open-source is only a piece of the puzzle.

But its the vital piece. The next step in human evolution because no one can own it. Society's natural problems solvers can never fall victim to the garbage delegators who antagonize new technology; whether a simple list of people to take out the garbage, or advanced software to combat Darth Blockbuster when he tried to keep us all buying and borrowing his DVDs.

Thus, open-source are the modern minuteman. The guardians of the people's interest and betterment who should be self-sufficient and well funded. But so many of you who write articles, answer questions, and make programs as a hobby, not a job. Even your leading organizations need donations to keep going. All while old tools like universities, television broadcasters, and insurance companies get massive subsidies, tax credits, and bailouts.

This huge difference signifies our society's great divide. Open-source heroes working against the odds to topple the gates antagonists are paid to maintain.

At first I only wanted to learn about open-source fight. Now I want to empower it. Telecommuting, right to repair, home power generation, real internet privacy; a better world is waiting once open-source has the resources to not only _make_ new tools but to _replace_ old tools too. Because the today's battle is new vs. old tools. Protagonists vs. antagonists. Jedi vs. Sith.

But the people don't know about you. They're stuck on "red/blue" politics. No one should be. These philosphies are very outdated. Their believers march and yell like its Woodstock in 1969, because technologically speaking they love 1969. The potential of digital tools is as lost to him as books, guns, and telescopes were to Darth King. It's no wonder regular people suffer outsourcing, micromanaging, and climate change.

You don't march for change, you force it because you know digital tools will improve our lives. But it's hard to explain. We don't yet understand how our "cyborgology" changes us as we pick up a radio, a smartphone, or a ticket to Mars. That's why I was so fascinated by your unspoken philosophy. You naturally feel the "majic" of digital tools, and want to distribute them to the hands of the people feeling the pain of inaction because who's better placed to evole humanity past our current problems.

I worked hard to turn your mindset into a new political philosophy called Techvolution. It's custom made for open-source and digital tools. It works like a web framework. Terms like "Darth Blockbuster", "Death Star rule book", "Jedi vs Sith" make it easier for the people to ask themselves the biggest political question of our time.

It's not the worn out and drab "Am I for red, or blue, politics?". But something that reaches for the future' "Am I going to step up and use digital tools to transform and vastly improve my society's way of life?".

The people don't see this question. They're too distracted by the "dark majic show" of fantasy football stats, fancy car commercials, and bombastic political rhetoric to realize how empowered they are.

Our job is to make the people look up from main street and realize their responsibility.

Our opportunity comes when a regular person has yet another problem with their tax forms, car radiator, ashphalt shingles, or the countless other tools antagonists keep alive. This is when the pain of living on the frontline makes regular people search for a better way to live.

And this moment is where I want to contribute back to open-source. Because this is where all its members can swell our ranks by saying;

  >That sucks. You don't have to live like this. Waiting on hold, getting caught by the fine-print, being micro-managed by eight different bosses. All that's bullshit. We can fight back. My friends and I invent new tools so we can live a simpler, fairer, healthier, greener, life. And we need your help... because it's our own ruling philosophy holding us back.

And when the regular person asks what they heck you're talking about, you can tell them to read Techvolution; a new political philosophy to help the world realize how you've empowered workers, creators, contributors, i.e. _the people_ willing to step up and not be left behind in a world you've only started to change.
