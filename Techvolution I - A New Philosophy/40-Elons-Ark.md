## Backpage

If those words stir hatred or love, you're not the righteous warrior you think you are, but just another person masking your fears with ideology.

People aren't joining Left or Right camps after careful consideration. They're huddling into groups because they're scared. The world has changed so much and few people know their place inside it. Crypto-currency, artifical inteligence, humanoid robots, space travel, and other wonderous technology changed our society. Ideologues tell you Left or Right is your salvation, but with their limited skillset of talking into a camera, professional ideologues are just as worried about losing their job as you should be.

We should all be scared. Our future is across a wide chasm and we don't know how to get across, because no one has built a society using the technology we just invented. Educating our young, earning money, political beliefs, our way of life is changing. So I wrote this book. It will teach you how to build bridges, boats, and ladders to the future using a new philosophy named Techvolution.

## Inner Flap

Conservatism (1801) and Progressivism (1866) will not secure your future. Both were born in the Industrial Age. Together they (usually with much cooperation) industrialized a mud road, pisspot, rural society. Obviously, we have many factories, roads, and toilets today so we should thank our ancestors hard work and sacrifice. But shouldn't follow their ideologies because our situation, tools, and problems, are different.

Climate change, borderless countries, aging population, are are among our problems. And to boot, we're in the Internet Age, which gives us a unique set of tools to solve our unique set of problems. We haven't upgraded our civilization yet because holding an iPhone isn't enough. It took generations for literacy and science to spread after the printing press (1489) was invented. Likewise, most people are still computer illiterate. Before we build a new society, a pivotal book must upgrade the masses and turn ideologies into mythologies. Only then can we master the tools to build a new society.

Techvolution is that book. I tall order of course, but if I didn't pull it off completely, I started a modern mindset that'll help us build the bridge to the future.

The journey to the promised land takes us through history, psychology, political theory, innovation, and evolutionary biology. The first step is reading a short story (what philosophers call a dialogue). Ancient stories tell us of a time God vanquised some and saved others with a great flood. As we start on the path out of the Industrial Age and into a new society, it's time to tell the story again. To find out what policies, ideas, and products we need in the future we must ask, "who today will reach Elon's Ark?"

## Dedication

For anyone who feels belittled, excluded, or oppressed in today's world, this book is for you. Just know, it's up to you to stop following the past and start a new, better, way of life.

For anyone satiated, enriched, or celebrated today, the youth have already forgotten most of your achievements because they're too busy dealing with climate change, government debt, unhealthy diets, borderless countries, and other systemic problems we handed them. If want a legacy, there's much work to do.

## Quote

"A typical American today, living in a postindustrial information-technology world, can get up in the morning, reach into the cabinet, get breakfast cereal that’s in a box, pour it, reach into the refrigerator, pour some milk. You can spend your entire day without ever elevating your heart rate...Human beings today don’t have to engage in physical activity anymore. It’s natural for us to think the world around us is normal. But our world, our lives today, are profoundly abnormal, especially in the case of no longer having to use physical activity as part of our daily routine. It's one example why we shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us. It's up to us to change."

## Opener

Ideologues hoping to survive the flood will be failures. Ideologues wanting to win the race will be foolish. Ideologues who do nothing will go extinct.

## Chapter 1 - Pull the Lever

 - The Socratic diversion so to speak must be longer. The two groups are separated by mountain ranges, and have diverged some time before. This is needed to show the isolation in both has had time to kill their progress. And that Saffron was unaware of the tra

 - Pull the lever! There's a milgram experiment ongoing. Socrates is filtering people based on the false pretense of a short cut. Everyone fails, no one gives the pencil.

"Who is to blame!". I yelled it. At him this dumsky. This whole ark adventure was surreal enough, and this asshole isn't telling me what I need to know in a story I shouldn't be living. Just say the words back to me.

- Crusades
- Colonialism
- Supply side economics

Simple words, just say them. I look at the man across the table.  Behind him is the boat. A fucking boat I need to get on because they're a flood coming you asshole. Get the words right this time.

- Crusades
- Colonialism
- Supplier relationships

Fucking idiot! You deserve this. You do. The boat you asshat. We only get on together. God this hurts. Sorry man.

My hand touches the switch turned "Off". Still off. Still. I look to the woman in the white coat, holding a clip board and pencil.

"The test requires that you continue."

On goes the switch.

Screams come from the man. Electricution does that. After the second of pain comes another round of cries and whimpering. The white coated woman makes another note in her log. I look to the next round of questions.

What is the square root...

"I can't. I can't. I'll take my chances"

The man detaches the electrotrudes. Gets up from his seat, and walks off the peir with laboured steps and hidden tears. I didn't notice how old he was. And Asian looking. I wonder if we have some family connections. Who knows. Now how do I get on the boat...

"You failed" the woman in the white coat says.
"You're a terrible teacher. Not fit for a space."

"Where am I supposed to go?"

"This isn't customer service."

The women was middle age, tall and a bit heavy. Not attractive for sure, but not that that matters. Especially to her. My indignation flies over her head. Instead she tosses some walnuts to the forest floor. Walnuts would be tasty right about now. But they bounce on the forst instead of going in my mouth and settle dead leaves, twigs, and the sprouts of new grass. A brown squirell comes and grabs it and nibbles the nutritious treat.

The women stands a few feet away, staring at the tiny creature, while a group of people stare in disbelief at her. In the background is a long boat and a stream.

MORE INNER DIALOGUE. IT SLOWLY TURNS SOCIAL VIA CONFLICT/DIALECTICS GETTING TO THE ARK.

The group is rag tag mixture; various ages and genders. They have bags filled with supplies. Evidently they've been planning on a journey, and while tired, are self-aware enough to know this boat isn't their salvation.

The group starts to pack their things. In the background there are hundreds of people travelling in column. But the column is dividing itself. One is heading east, the other west, along the two routes that head up the mountain range.

The scene is quite the spectacle. Trucks, caravans, buses, are leaving the flat plains of the valley hitting uneven terrain and old logging roads.

The group converse, debate and argue, and ultimately one set goes east and west.

Saffron has stayed behind. The woman, who throughout the drama has been watching the squirell that, done with its treat, has been searching the ground for another.

"I don't know which way to go." says Saffron.

Saffron smiles. "Or you'll steal my things and sell me into slavery. The entire country is looking for those ships. The caps have mostly melted. There's enough moisture and heat in this world now to flood the lands..."

"Like Noah's Biblical flood?" she mocks his anxiety.

"The soil so wet and clouds so dark our food won't grow. It'll take decades to fix. The ships to the space colonies are a salvation."

"What's your name?" asks Saffron.

"Socrates. Get in the boat or stop wasting my time."

Saffron looks at the book. It's a Boston Whaler. It's unsinkable he remembers. He wants to look inside and see what this lady is all about.

He puts his pack down, drops his machete, and takes off his shoes, and puts the socks around his neck. He walks through water and touches the boat, and looks inside. A elderly women is tied up.

Tied up and gagged her eyes "Help!"
(create a Modified Milgram Test that he fails of course)

Saffrons looks around. Rope is on the floor, beans are on the shelf, a knife is on the console. He feels the pocket knife in his pants. He braces to jump into the boat, slips on the slick plastic, and falls hard into the water.

Two mean appear from the woods.

"Saffron, this is Plato and Aristotle." The last words were spoken with the glee recently used against her.

Running jumps from the water. The men smile and extend their hands. Saffron bolts. 

Socrates looks with indignation as Saffron flees.

"The squirell!", yells Socrates. Saffron stops and looks back.

"Feed the squirells. It might help you."

He keeps running.

## Chapter - Welcome

The forest ground is damp. Moss grows heavy. Each step of Saffron's bare feet sinks a few inches into the ground. He can finally hear the crunching of tires over gravel and wood in the distance, but he's too tired to keep running towards them.

Standing inside the forest he sees a huge square opening. The pine trees, so neatly planted, have been clear cut in a mile by mile square. He sits on a stump and looks at the massive deforestation. He hammerfists his thigh several times, lamenting his idiocy trusting a stranger. Her name was apparently Socrates which makes his mistake all the more ridicules.

He looks at his bare feet already swollen from moisture. His socks are still wrapped around his neck. He knows to wear them now is to ruin them. He'll have to get new supplies from the people up ahead.

But which people. He's in the middle of the two groups now, one going east the other west. And he can't delay any longer.

He glances up. Heavy clouds hang low above the forest. There's a small gap in the massive cloud blanket. He can see two mountain ridges, two routes going up towards the peak obscured by more clouds.

"Why are you thinking about it?" a voice ask from forest several yards away.

Saffron turns around, stands, and faces a gant elderly white male with blue eyes and gray hair.

"I'm Saffron, who are you?"

"Bias. Nice to meet you. What were you thinking about if you don't mind me asking."

"What everyone else is. What's the fastest way to the top."

"I'm sorry, I didn't see anyone following you?" Bias grins the words while mockingly looking around Saffron's shoulder.

He continues "If you knew the fastest way to the Ark, people would be following you. There are two options. One group helps you, the other uses you. That side going east... No rule of law, no individual creativity allowed, the rich control everything. They only want the powerful to reach the Ark. And you don't have any shoes."

Saffron stands in silence, he notices how he's left and raising each foot from the mocky ground. His body needs it he guesses. "Who are you." he finally asks.

"I hang back to save stranglers from falling behind. Since the Schism, I welcome people from the other side. It's no surprise how many are coming back. Everyday it's more. Just the other day a family of three."

"Why did you choose to go on the western slope route?"

"We voted that way. The experts presented the facts, we talked, we voted, and we're going to win because we listen to reason."

"Can I get shoes?"

"I won't even ask you where yours went. Of course you'll get a pair, maybe even two. Unless you go the wrong way of course". 

## Chapter - Selection

Saffron walks on a gravel road. The stones are digging into his feet. Bias is up ahead. A group of three people dressed in black and red confront them.

Bias whispers "wait here."

The elderly guide approaches the trio who stand still in front of him. Saffron can't hear the words. He's distracted with thinking if he should put on his socks or not. Bias animates his hands as he speaks with passion. He puts his hand on the shoulder on one man, who turns his head in response to the apparent slight. Bias quickly removes it.

After a few more words, Bias looks back at Saffron.

"Let's go" Bias says.

"Was there a problem?"

"We're just getting more particular. But they liked your look."

The two keep walking and finally come across a group of people and a large vehice. It's a battery powered truck, with a bunch of attachments on both sides. People are getting some shit out.

"You ready for the party?" Jasmine asks. She's short, sturdy, hard working,, and rationale. The type of girl many married friends wished they'd married but were too superficial to. Fucking marketing he notes.

"It's going to be a good one" Bias beams back. "This is a new member. Found him struggling to decide which way to go."

"I never gave it a second thought. Good choice brother."

"Thanks. Happy to be here. What are you working on?" Saffron says.

"The light show. The best you've seen in years I guarantee it."

"Cool. Need some help. I can climb any trees...why do you have rigging?"

"Told you, the best light show you've seen. Let's get it ready."

"I just need some shoes"

"Of course you do. But later, we must hurry."

Saffron and Jasmine remove lights from the truck. Big ones, small ones, many colors. The long strands of Holiday lights are many meters long. The duo unravels them all. Soon Jasmine sets up spot lights and Saffron climbs trees, wrapping the lights around branches and trunks.

His bare feet help me grip the bark better. They soon cover with zap from the evergreens and collect bits that ironically help act as a shoe or sorts.

 - More creativity. Lots of it....And he's an eager employee. Buying into the narrative that surrounds him of the Gross Daily Progress.

After a few hours of work, Jasmine and Saffron stand together, holding a switch. Jasmine flicks it and...

Voila! Lights illumiate an acre of forest. And we see the hundreds of people who have been waiting rush in to start the party.

The comedian Jerry Seinfeld once joked "can of soda". This even is close to that. It's a party. People frolick. That's the best way to describe it, frolicking people in a forest.

In one corner Star Wars imperial storm troopers are battling Jedi knights. The pretend last blasts are firing at the pretend lightsabers. Periodically a stormtrooper falls down to the slash of a sword.

There are other groups. Someone in a Iron Man custume is battling a Japanese anime outfit. There's Alien characters and Terminators. Some guys are buff, a few more girls are hot, but most are just people having a great time.

Of course the party is more diverse then coplayers. Another group is wearing slant clothing, or no clothing. Men, women, and all the genders in between are waving flags. It's a sex party for anyone who wants to join in, but most just talk and giggle to each other.

The entire group is many hundreds strong. The groups are diverse. Some are religious and speak amongst themselves. BE MORE specific?

There's another group of people, mostly white some Asians and blacks. All are in well kept hiking gear. They sit around benches that sip wine converse among themselves, the look around at the groups but don't interact with any of them.

It's probably alright Saffron thinks to himself. He giggles at the spectacle. He looks over at the coplayers, then picks up a large stick from the forest floor. He rushes over to a group running for some reason or another and says "You shall not pass!" The mixture of characters takes the challenge the kids play fight.

MAKE IT A THEMED party. It's superficial of course. LoTR.

NEED A PROGRESS INDICATION. IFFY LIKE GDP. IT'S PROMINIENT, LIKE THE DEATH NOTICE IN HUNGER GAMES.

## Chapter - Morning

It's been several days since.

Yellow rays of sunshine crawl on a mountainscape. The illumination creeps along, including more trees, creeks, and animals into its warm blanket. It's the start of a new day, and proof that everyone seeing it survived the night.

There are tents littered throughout the valley. People also sleep outside.

A stormtrooper is sleeping with an X-Men, Robin Hood, and a monster of some kind. Most are out cold with sleep, clothes barely covering themselves. The storm trooper removes the mask and its Saffron in a stupor of sorts.

He gets up in stages of revilization. Like a withered plant taking in water. His bare feet walk on the floor. The valley is different. It's a new place he's in today. It's surprisngly dry with a mixture of waste on it. Most from nature, but much is soiled clothes, paper plates, needles and condoms.

He walks around looking among the trash. Some shoes, any shoes, flips flops would be okay. Nothing.

At the end of the clearing, he stops and stares at the sunrise. What a shame he thinks. This world still has so much beauty. This image used to be his screensaver, now the image is a gameboard for desperate. He looks up at the peak, and then East and spits his disgust. 

"Hurry up." Jasmine says blandly. She's hurting more than he is. A flower still without its water.

Saffron turns around. Jasmine is struggling to take a spotlight down. She doesn't look at him.

"You see the sunrise?", he points at the sun.

"We need to change the configuration for the party tonight. Or, we don't get paid."

She seems unhappy. Well obviously Saffron says, but why? Better not to ask. Not yet. He doesn't even know her last name yet. Besides she partied with everyone else. She can't be all bad.

Wait he thinks, another party?

Whatever. Maybe he'll get paid and but some shoes. Maybe then I'll get my shoes he thinks as he climbs the trees. Just as well, as heavy clouds move in and the sunrise is obscured again.

The duo dismantles their setup as the partygoers gradually wake up.

Eventually the lights are all assembled into the truck. The people get moving as a convoy.

Jasmine gets in the truck, so does Saffron "we need a new theme for the party tonight. You ever read The Great Gastby."

## Chapter - What the heck is up.





## Chapter - Rank with Unspoken Rationale

Through the trees he jogs, towards the voices and even the sounds of tires running over gravel. 

"What rank are you!" shouts a man from the darkness.

Saffron jogs towards the voice.

Lights illuminate him from multiple angles. Now he stops.

(What tools would they use for enforcement?)

"Don't move. Stand where you are. Where do you come from and why are you alone?"

Several persons walk from the dark woods and form a semi-circle around Saffron. Two are black, one native American, two Hispanic. One wears a dress and wears lipstick and another is wearing black from head to toe with facemask and red letters sticked everywhere.

Each has a purple belt wraps around their clothes and hold a sword, pistol, or rifle as they wait for an answer. 

Saffron stares at one of them.

"Hey Jim, you were in my group."

Jim doesn't flinch. The group still stares while waiting for their answer.

"I was born outside Cleveland."

"You mean the place that doesn't exist anymore." One of the gang fires back.

Saffron's heart skips a beat.

"What's your fucking lineage!" cries another gang member.

"Blended. Two grandparents were American white and black. The others were philapino Chinese and Indian... I went to Brown Univeristy for economics and was working at..."

"Your a yellow belt."
(rankings are those consultancy based)

One of the gang throws a yellow belt to him. 

"What do you have on you." the Hispanic ones says it while padding Saffron down. He finds a pocket knife, a spoon and fork, candy bars, and a notebook.

"Yellows never touch a weapon... the rest you can keep". The man puts the knife inside a pouch.

"I need some shoes"

"Shut-up, stay in the rear, and do as your fucking told."

The enforces depart. Saffron shamed and scared walks towards the sounds of footsteps. He ties his yellow belt on.

He comes to a line of people walking on a old gravel mining road. Most people are white, some are black or Asian. All wear white belts, the others yellow.

"Welcome yellow. You best put the socks on."






## Ideas

 - Saffron goes for it, shows initative because surely achievement will be rewarded.
 - Money is still earned via tech/product useage, thus everything is overused regardless of mission at hand.
 - Joins West and there's a parade of individual celebration, such a great time. still no shoes though, maybe sandles.
 - Occasional speechs from West Leader.
 - Joins purples/socrates. other competents join too.
 - closing line; saffron "so when do you party?", "when there's something to celebrate"
 - Frodo/Gollum searching for the grail, the guarantee ones genes will be passed on without having to compete/take the chance (placid paul).

## How Life Solves Problems
Creatures connue playing because their combination of attributes gives them an edge. But, as the planet inevitably changes, traits lose their advantage. Thus, while evolution is a constant race to harvest resources more efficiently, no species ever knows if its list of adaptions is good enough to overcome the problems of its environment. That's why pain hurts so much; it's Life's way of telling individuals to change their behavior and try something else before it's too late.

Evolution has these laws:

 - No species survives forever.
 - All lifeforms have a common ancestry.
 - Evolution of new species is gradual.
 - The number of species always multiplies to fill niches.
 - Natural selection determines which individuals lives on.

These laws describe the patterns and processes of evolution. The competition started after a few amino acids combined to form the first cells 3.6 billion years ago. Since then, evolution has continually created new species. Each is based on the prior one, but each removes or adds traits to find an edge. That edge could mean simple improvements like getting bigger or smaller, faster or slower. Or, the edge could be a specialization to find a niche no one else has, such as polar bears being the only seal hunters seals in a frozen ecosystem.

Regardless of what new adaptation an organism evolves, evolution's selection of the best adaptations requires daily and hourly scrutiny throughout the world of every adaptation, even the slightest. The best way to continually test species is with ecosystems. By putting creatures inside a shared environment, there are checks and balances to keep everyone able to harvest resources from the environment and each other. So when any plant, fungus, scavenger, predator, herbivore, or omnivore falls behind, Life can easily search the ecosystem and create a new species to take the laggard's place. Crucially, all lifeforms cooperate inside ecosystems to keep Life playing the game of survival.

It took scientists centuries to demystify the story of Life's evolution, and this summary misses the many details. But the essence is here: Life must adapt new species to Earth's ever-changing environment. The faster, the better; the more species, the better. Individual evolution suffers no interference because individuals are Life's unit of selection. Wherever there's liquid water, an artist named evolution works night and day, creating custom lifeforms to harvest every possible ray of sunshine, food scrap, and heat source. Evolutions's constant stream of creations is the only reason Earth isn't just another rock revolving around a star with no one to notice how beautiful the Universe is.

Because animals sadly can't change their genes. Like the polar bear now, all must endure the pain of "survival of the fittest" to evolve. We humans also evolved via the same laws of evolution. But once we invented technology, our evolution started to look a little different.

## Scrap

Donald Trump is making the the middle-class great again. He's a self-made billionaire, giving regular people better jobs and honest government. Fight for him, like he fights for you!

No, wait. Donald Trump is am egomaniac con artist dragging America towards the flames of climate change, bankruptcy, and implosion. Join the fight against him!

This "Techvolution" is just more liberal elitism undermining real American values. I'll stick with proven conservatism and capitalism over this pseudo-scientific nonsense any day.

The "Techvolution" is just a ploy by the capitalist elite to undermine our vital progressive work. We need bold, revolutionary action, not compromises with the oppressors.

"Techvolution? More like techno-socialism trying to brainwash us away from the free market principles that made America great."

"I'll take good old-fashioned conservatism over this fancy 'evolutionary biology' nonsense any day. This is just liberal elites trying to undermine our values."

"Forget Techvolution - I'm sticking with the time-tested wisdom of capitalism and traditional family values, not some pseudo-intellectual fad."

"Techvolution is nothing but a distraction from the real revolutionary change we need. It's just the establishment trying to co-opt our movement."

"This 'Techvolution' is just another ploy by the oppressive capitalist class to maintain their grip on power. We won't compromise our socialist principles!"

"Down with Techvolution! We need bold, systemic transformation, not more empty rhetoric from ivory tower academics out-of-touch with the people's struggle."

"Techvolution? More like a Trojan horse for big government socialism to trample all over good old American capitalism and Christian values!"

"This 'evolutionary biology' nonsense is just liberal elites trying to brainwash hardworking patriots. I'll take my chances with the free market, thank you very much!"

"Forget Techvolution - I'd rather let a swarm of illegal immigrant locusts devour this country than let some ivory tower academics destroy our God-given conservative principles!"

"Techvolution? More like a dog whistle for the oppressive capitalist class to maintain their stranglehold on the means of production and crush the working class revolution!"

"This so-called 'Techvolution' is nothing but a shiny new distraction from the real systematic change we need - the gloves are coming off, comrades, and the bourgeoisie better watch out!"

"Techvolution? I'd rather eat glass than compromise our socialist ideals with some watered-down, corporate-friendly pseudo-science nonsense. The people's struggle cannot be contained!"

"World wars, economic collapse, climate change - that's all just fear-mongering as far as I'm concerned. I'll be long gone before any of that affects my cushy little life."

"Techvolution, civil unrest, environmental catastrophe? Sounds like a whole lot of hysteria to me. I've got mine, so why should I worry about the future?"

"The left wants revolution, the right wants to burn it all down. Meanwhile, I'll be sipping my mojito on the beach, safe from all their petty squabbles."

"Ideological extremists can fight it out all they want, but I'll be insulated from the fallout in my gated community. Techvolution? More like tech-no-thanks for me."

"Global instability, resource wars, societal collapse? That's a 'you' problem, not a 'me' problem. I plan to ride out whatever apocalypse is coming in the comfort of my private bunker."

"Let the world tear itself apart over Techvolution, socialism, or whatever the flavor of the month is. I'll be too busy enjoying my lavish retirement to get dragged into that mess."

"Techvolution opened my eyes to the fundamental laws governing human progress - no more getting bogged down in left-right ideological nonsense."

"Instead of parroting partisan talking points, Techvolution showed me how to ask the right questions and discover my own solutions to everyday challenges."

"Gone are the days of feeling helpless in the face of global crises. Techvolution equipped me with an evolutionary framework to navigate our technology-driven world."

"Techvolution isn't about easy answers, it's about developing the critical thinking skills to tackle complex problems head-on. A refreshing change from political theatrics."

"Rather than wasting time fighting the same old culture wars, Techvolution inspired me to leverage technology and innovation to improve my own life and community."

"Techvolution may not offer entertainment value, but it gave me something far more valuable - the tools to be an active agent of positive change, not just a spectator."
