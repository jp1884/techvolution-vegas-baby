## Too Many Rules on the Book

In 1948, the Surpeme Court brokered a deal between the movie studio's and the justice department. The "paramount consent decrees" was an agreement banning studio's from owning movie theatres, or coordinating with them on pricing and product.

Movie theatres were the only screen in town. They showed all news, documentaries, public service accouncements, and stories. The studios owned about 10% of theatres, and gave themselves the best movies. This gave them control over all video distribution, which the government thought unfair, hence the paramount decrees. Of course in 1948 television was invented, a new tool that did everything the new rule was supposed to.

But the rule still stuck. Even till today. It's against the rules for the movie industry to have Apple stores, or even be like HBO and Netflix. After 1948, the movie industry made movies hoping the independent theatres would agree to show it. You can see why the studio's loved "directly selling" DVD's to their customers when the chance came.

Before 1948, he movie industry had a "studio system". It can be called "the genius of the system" because they consistently made classic stories that had enough surprises, and logic, that most anyone could enjoy them, much like Netflix today.

Working with the paramount restrictions in the 1950's and 1960's was tough. However the industry was still operated by classic storytellers who still made good stories with stars like, John Wayne, Elizabeth Taylor, James Dean.

However, come the 1970's movie theatres were almost dead. They needed to attract customers, but were not allowed to lower prices, or create popular series. They tried 3D movies, but like that last attempt it was a fade. So what happened was art and spectacle. Here's what John Wayne said about it in 1973.

> All the real motion picture people have always made family pictures. But the downbeats and the so-called intelligentsia got in when the government stupidly split up the production companies and the theaters. The old giants like Mayer, Thalberg, even Harry Cohn, despite the fact that personally I couldn't stand himâ€”were good for this industry. Now the goddamned stock manipulators have taken over. They don't know a goddamned thing about making movies. They make something dirty, and it makes money, and they say, 'Jesus, let's make one a little dirtier, maybe it'll make more money.' And now even the bankers are getting their noses into it.

The bankers did. When Jaws, Star Wars, Indiana Jones were massive hits, they said, give me more of that. What else could anyone do. Making classic stories requires taking chance to see what works, and that requires showing movies to audience. Takng these chances is not allowed per the rules.

So, here we are today, watching the same blockbuster stories, but with more effects, and spectacle each time, so hopefully we wont notice the stories kinda suck. Studio's keep making them, because they can tell theatres. Studio executives are no longer classic storytellers, but agents and dealmakers fighting to control the rights to our 1970's culture.

And as they made ever more spectacle movies, the movie industry compensated by making ever more art films. These from Sundance, Cannes, Toronto, Tribeca and whereever else they like holding parties and panels. Films that get weirder and weirder, where the hero talks about themselves and doesn't solve regular problems.

That's why movies are so expenseive. Movie studio's want their production money back. So they sign deals giving them 90% of ticket revenne on the first weekend. 80% on the second and so forth. That's why they market movies like crazy, to get people in when the studio's get the money.

The theatres thus fight for revenue with popcorn price higher than sushi. 

A movie industry forced to make spectacle and art films because a rule in 1948. How many more rules are out there holding us back?

Good stories versus bad stories. When I was a projectionist I (and any other) could tell the difference without ever seeing the movie. We just watched the audience's reactions. If they scream, cry, laugh, yell, it's a good story. Even more telling was listening to moviegoers walk out. If they marvelled about twists, turns, and cool lines, you know the story was really good because it turned fiction into reality.

The audience is never wrong. They can't be. Laughing, being surprised, remembering cool lines is not audience's job. They're jobs is only to watch. It's the storytellers job to give its audience emotions and memories.

## Open Source

The key concept to open source is that the rules are open. Everyone who uses Chrome, can go and see what the code says. Very few people know what to look for, but by opening up to everyone, we don't give anyone the power to decide who is doing the looking.

When I asked a movie theatres reporter about ending the paramount decrees, so that cheaper movies could charge lower prices to compete with blockbuster movies, here's the response i got.

Your question about the possibility of studios once again having a controlling hand in the exhibition sector is one that has come up from time to time, and as you know from your research, that form of ownership is largely prohibited because of the 1948 ruling by the Supreme Court.  And, as you also know, the decision was based on the notion that vertical integration under the old Hollywood studio system was in violation of antitrust laws.  That notion is still widely accepted and is the reason why production/distribution houses and movie theaters remain separate businesses.

Your argument that vertical integration would actually improve competition (in terms of product with lower budgets being given a more level playing field, so to speak) is an interesting one, but the industry is highly unlikely to return to that model for many reasons.  Having covered the exhibition side, I would say that theater operators feel that production houses/distributors already have too much say in where product is unfurled (it's sort of an open secret that studios strike more favorable deals with theater chains that have more desirable sites in terms of markets and neighborhoods within those markets, etc.).  Exhibitors have also argued for years that producers/distributors fare far better in terms of admissions because of standard box office splits (believed to be as high as 90%/distribs to 10%/exhibs on opening weekend), so ceding any more power to the other side is, to put it mildly, a longshot.

The movies got super popular being a affordable, and dependable, night out. People dressed nicely to go the the theatres. There was live entertainment, pre-shows, drinks, and socializing. People waited in line with anticipation. Much like Apple Stores today.

Whether or not the movie's should re-open up their own stores is an open question. The fact they we customers, other than the very few guys with an interest, should be ale to see the rules isn't. The only thing keeping the paramount rules on the book, is the public doesn't realize how much it changes their econonmy.

The Life Star would tell us. Every rule written would have a rationale, and it would be connected to teh industry in which it governs, just like aline of computer code. And everyone could see what rule the effect is having with experiments, not a belief system.
