# CHAPTER FOUR - THE PLOT

THIS LIFESTAR IS THE MACGUFFIN SO TO SPEAK. IT'S A TOOL THAT UPDATES THE DEATHSTAR/RULEBOOK OF DB.

## Galileo

In the midst of the Scientific Revolution, the ruling philosophy was suffering another attack. One of its most important DNA points was being questioned. The Earth moved. Quite the statement, the Eden of life, was moving, and spinning, like a rock being thrashed around by an ocean called space.

Galileo Galillie stood before the Catholic Inquisition, the interpreters of the ruling philosophy with the power to defend it with torture and death. Already torn apart 100 years before by Martin Luther and John Calvin heretical claims the Pope isn't the supreme authority on Western Civilizations religion. For the last hundred years, Europe's been tearing itself a part because some assholes wanted to change the DNA. Now another asshole wants to say the Earth moves! Doesn't he know what this means. There'd barely be any DNA left!

That's why the Pope, and the powerful Jesuit monks, once friends of Galileo, didn't care if anyone said the Earth might move. Maybe's don't change DNA. But arguments about math, and angles, and that damn telescope, leave the DNA open to questions. Questions bring disorder, and disorder returns Europe to the anarchy of Rome's collapse. Fuck!

Why'd the Catholic protectors of society's DNA, care so much about a scientific question. Well it wasn't a science question. Earth's place in the Universe was a DNA question. It goes back to the darn Greeks again. With the naked eye, the Universe, the galaxy, and the solar system is a massive riddle. Look up at the night sky, outside of a city, when there's nothing but life's canvas, and try to make sense of it. It's impossible to even know if we're even moving, never mind how everything works. The truth was there to be discovered, but couldn't be sensed by our biological senses.

Ancient Greece had two astronomical teams. Aristarchus (310-230 BC) argued the Earth and all planets moved around a stationary Sun (Heliocentrism), and Aristotle (384â€“322 BC) argued the Sun and all planets moved around the Earth (Geocentrism). Society went with Aristotle. Because with human eyes it makes more sense the Sun moves. For one, the nearest object, the Moon, does revolve around us. But the biggest reason was asking if the Earth was moving, why don't the stars move in the background?  (It's called stellar parallax. The Ancient Greeks could not believe Aristarchus when he said we can't see the stars move because they are _extremely_ far away). Geocentrism was thus written into our science. And a scientific question, was adopted by Greek philosophy to explain many answers for society's DNA. Where does good and evil come from? Where do the gods live? What's humanity's place in the Universe?

The world being the centre of the Universe, made sense, especially to Socrates's best student, Plato (428-348). Plato believed in a place of perfection that he called the "forms". The Universe looked so amazing, and it never seemed to move around, and thus perhaps that's where justice, ethics, and good came from. The imperfect world was beneath us, in the lava hell. And Earth, was in between, as a place of good and bad, life and death. That's why Zeus and the other Greek gods, lived in the sky, near the perfect forms, and death and demons lived inside the Earth. And so it stayed, until Emperor Theodosius I made Christianity Rome's official religion. Now Christianity needed its own answers for the mythology of an entire Empire. Tons of questions were asked of Christian theologians to fill Rome's own DNA, like what's a justifiable war, why is slavery okay, and does the Earth move.

For the last question, Christianity went with the best science at the time, and that meant Plato and especially Aristotle. The Earth was the centre of the Universe. You can see it with your own two eyes.

And once Christianity was adopted by kings in Western Civilization, they had a great pre-existing heirarchy of good and bad, to place themselves in. So if God, live in the sky (like Zeus once did) and the Devil was inside the Earth waiting to digest the living, then Kings, as God's chosen leaders, placed themselves at the top of the order of human perfection. Kings told their subjects, if God is perfect because he lives in the perfect Heavens, then a king must be perfect because he's above you. As geocentrism reigned supreme, so did kings.

Geocentrism was reality. It wasn't a bad one. It predicted the future well enough. The star charts worked, ships navigated the sea, the Julian and Gregorian calendars were relatively accurate. Geocentric models only needed to be updated every once and a while.

Because Galileo was in trouble because he didn't just say the Earth moved. He built tools. He was arrogantly, making it easy for people to see for themselves. His books, much like Frederick Douglass's, brought answers to the people. _Letters on Sunspots_ (1613) showed the phases of Venus, the moons of Jupiter, and Sunspots, all of which should not exist in geocentrism. And worst of all, like Douglass oratory proving the equality of all people in the flesh, Galileo told people they can see the truth for themselves, by making themselves a cyborg, and looking through a telescope.

The lesson is simple to read, yet very important to understanding revolution. Ancient Greek philosophers like Aristarchus, Aristotle, and Plato were all using their own biological senses to understand the entire Universe. They did a good job considering their limitations.

What Techvolution is about, is recognizing that once our sense get augmented by new technology, by definition our society's DNA can be upgraded with better answers byway of effectual truth. It does't mean we throw everything out, but we can update to better, clearer, more provable answers.

I never met Aristotle. But I still know he would have looked through the telescope if he could, then rethink his theories. The ultimate lesson of Greek philosophy is everything is questionable, especially what we think is unquestionable. That only means its more likely to be wrong. Better technology, better senses, just means more questions. What philosophy would hate that?

And Galileo carried the flag of Socrates, and questioned what society said not to. The Inquisition didn't kill him, but sentenced house arrest. Oh, and here's a recreation of what it looked like to use Galileo's telescope, when looking at Jupiter, and seeing its moons

![The Galean Moons](/img\ch4\side-by-side_med_hr.png)
_We now call them Galileo's moons._

That little, hazy image, did more than any battle could. It upturned a ruling philosophy, because the ruling philsoophy thought it was above the technology that created it. Yet we've learned, technological development will always usurp society's DNA. That's why Europe suffered through dozens of revolutions after Copernicus and Galileo proved the Earth moved.

And don't laugh. We aren't much better. Because what's the image that's going to change your ruling philosophy. It's out there somewhere, waiting for somebody to take look. And we don't even know what it looks like. Because we aren't even wondering what it is. Because we haven't mastered revolutions with techvolution yet.

Here's a hint. From Aristotle to Galileo, the world's people's thought the world revolved around them physically. Look through the human created world of mythology you live in today. This time your ancient beliefs are not the Universe revolves around you physically. This time the truth is the Universe does not revolve around you mentally. In the first stage of modernity space, mathematics, medicine, all of nature was the topic of wonder and discovery; now you are. All your choices, desires, impulses, preferences, tastes, opinions, habits, obessesions, endulgences, fears, disorders, illnesses, actions, and addictions, catered to by ruling philospohy of liberal free-market economics, are now have to be held up to the test of effectual truth.

## The Plot Looking At Our Society With a Lens

The plot of a story, is the series of events the main character goes through to solve a problem. The plot of _Star Wars_ is Luke Skywalker bringing the Death Star's secret plans to the rebel base. He thereafter has a chance to use those plans to destroy the Death Star, or be destroyed.

The plot of life is similar. Except life doesn't care which of its lifeforms wins or loses, as long as life can live on and defeat death. So to master revolutions, means to master ruling philosophies, and the technological development that will one day discredit them. That's a plot. Our problem to understand our own plot, is we've never been able to actually see and track our plot. Both inside our microstories, and our grandstory.

Until Galileo and Newton invented their telescopes, nobody could see into the once perfect heavens of Plato and Aristotle. Better lensmaking technology changed an entire ruling philosophy. And now we have digital technology. And it, let's us track plot. We just aren't ready to use this new technology to proactively question our ruling philosophy.

We can see this, in our own lives. Few people are happy with our digital society. Because they're being forced to hold a telescope, yet not look through it. Or better put, they're expected to use digital technology to confirm they Earth doesn't move. That jobs and bosses of industries based on paper, and telephones, and physical banks, are still the leaders, even if their ruling philosophy is so old. Thus, the plot of so many microstories doens't makes sense to most people.

## Digital Plot

So the plot of life is already there. We already live it. We just can't sense it. Like Galileo's telescope, once we augment our senses, we can sense better and see a better truth.

The question is how will society's mirror look like? Well like most things, we can trust in Sean Bean. Because the first mass printed book was a porno. The first telescope was toy. The first gun was a novelty. And the first glimpse of using digital technology to track the plot of life, the grandstory and your microstory, is in computer games. Spend a few minutes and listen to Sean Bean explain how society's work.

_Civilization_ like games are called city builders and real-time strategy games. There are one's where you build a city like _SimCity_ or _Anno 1800_. In these games you start with a village and your goal is to plan and allocate resources as best you can to keep your city alive and prosperous. Your enemy is nature and your own mismanagement. There are some games like _Age of Empires_, _Total War_, and _Civilization_, which are similar, except you build a civilization and war with other nations for survival.

When we see society from the top down, all at once, and every story is tracked, our understanding greatly increases. We stop assuming our microstory is the most important, because we can see other stories as well. We can judge, understand, take in. Every aspect, from leaders to workers, sanitation to armies, are important. There are no interest groups of pro-choice, pro-life activists, no oil lobbyists, who scream, bride, and deal for special attention. Just you, running a society. It's quite a lesson to us modern individuals who assume our only job is doing stuff we like and liberal free-market economics takes care of the rest.

Today, society simulation games are played by millions because they're so real to life. Instead of telling players "the United States has no purpose", these games tell players to make society work or everyone dies. Storms, disease, starvation, invasions wait around every corner. And even better, these games say fuck being happy just building a society, build a civilization! Build Athens, Rome, China, Japan, Britain, build glory!

Building a better civilization It's what life is doing with us. And now because of digital technology, we can see how it real time, inside our own lives, not just in a computer game.

## Components of Civilization

Do you see our lessons narrated by Sean Bean. These games make players "god", a "player god" who runs every detail of society and decides things like where to build cities, who to attack, when to upgrade to electric cars, and what religion to enforce.

What we call life, God, the gods, or magic, is a real thing. In reality, every society has a "player god" who is responsible for running the grandstory. There's a long to-do list. Things like getting fresh water, food, and building material. Building waste dumps, roads, and powerlines. Funding research and development. Erecting defenses and attacking others. All these requirements are among many of society's functions - established operations to provide what society and its individuals need. It's the player god's responsibility to manage them well.

Most people's in history, and even today, believe in a higher power for this reason; be it mythology, folklore, or religion. Like in these games, it's the job of the higher power to make sure society functions well. Society believing in a higher power is a way for society to direct itself towards a shared goal. A noble lie for individuals to all believe in, and thereby understand the directives they give each other, from the "player god" which is really their shared community consciousness. Like _The Matrix_, the shared consciosness is too abstract for anyone to fully grasp, yet too powerful for most anyone to ignore.

In history the player god has been tribal mythologies, the Greek pantheon, Christian theology, or written declarations and constitutions. Each has always professed to be the same thing, the best player god to make society happy. How does society give itself a player god, and how are decisions decided by the player god are pivotal questions, one's that we'll answer in this book. It's easier to understand these grand questions by using computer games, because in the game, your the player god.

The second lesson from computer games, is learning the one limitation to being god; philosophy. Philosophy is a society's "organizing principle" or its "ruling philosophy". How the commands of the player god are implemented by real-life people. While no person can be the player god, individuals, like Aristotle, Rousseau, and James Madison, can make a philosophy to represent visions of the good society they see when thinking about the player god. Philosophy is the link between the player god and humans, because while average people can't interpret the player god, we can interpret a philosophy, like Bloomberg did for the Declaration of Independence, to help us run our society.

In simulation games, player gods select a civilization to play as, like ancient Egypt, Republican Rome, or Victorian Britain. Every option has slightly different charactistics defined by the dominate philosophy. Egypt has mysticism and the divine belief in their pharaoh, Rome has stoicism and the divine belief in their republic, Britain has liberal free-market economics, and the divine belief in their parliament and monarchy.

Each philosophy breaks down into modes and orders as individuals implement the philosophy when they make society function. For example, the Soviet Union, using the communist philosophy, had sports team with great playmaking because communism encourages cooperation. American sports teams had better star players because their philosophy was liberalism, which encourages individuality. These same philosophies also meant Soviet scientists couldn't study genetics because it was anti-communist to prove some genes were better than others. Liberal scientists (so far) have no issue with genetics, so have unlocked many wonders of the natural world. Yet neither philosophy of communism or liberalism ever talked about how to play sports or study genetics. In fact, the writers of both philosophies never heard of either. The followers of both philosophies simply interpreted their daily life through the lens of their society's philosophy. That's how the personal interpretation of a philosophy guides all societies; from sports teams to science labs, classrooms to movies.

So while every society has a player god trying to win the game, what really makes each society different is their philosophy. The player god is thus limited, molded, and interpreted by the ruling philosophy of its people.

The third lesson we'll learn from these games is about ourselves. Because we're inside this game in real-life, subject to the decisions of the player god and our own philosophy. We're those little fake people, running around the fake city, living our microstories. When we are selected, and "clicked" by the player god, like Sophia was when Hugh told her it was wrong to teach a slave, we're given a philosophy and told to be a peace activist, or soldier, a trucker, or a customer. In reality most people's opinions and interest are determined by their "clicked" status, yet most people don't realize that. Digital technology can help us see our clicked status, by showing us how our microstory is doing inside the grandstory.

We'll also learn about extraordinary individuals. The giants you see in the games, are real to life as well. Be they Julius Caesar or Albert Einstein, Aristotle, or Elon Musk. Learning how to find, nourish, and follow these giants is often the key quickly updating society to better functions and philosophies to make a happy society.

The fourth lesson is technology trees. Technology has stages of progression based on their functonal contribution to society. Functions are the established operations of a society. Protection, shelter, learning, repopulation, building, and sanitation are examples. Functions are made real with technology. As technology changes, how the function happens does as well. So for example, the first tools to protect ourselves were our own fists. According to the technology tree of protection, we started with clubs, which became spears, bronze swords, steel swords, bows and arrows, flintlock guns, now rifles, and soon lasers.

A society's mixture of functions is its way of life. Thus we can change our way of life by choosing a different mixture of functions. For example, if gas engines are polluting our air too much, then maybe we should upgrade to electic cars, or telecommuting as a function of transportation.

Deciding on the mixture of functions is what the player god does. These games are perfect to learn from because it's expected civilization will transform as they go through technological ages. There's no surprises, no special interest like oil companies resisting electric cars or managers resiting telecommuting, because transitions are going to happen. The job of the player god is to manage them.

The last lesson is integration. Society's player god, philosophy, individuals, and functions are all interlinked. In these games, choosing to change a philosophy, or upgrade to telecommunications, or fund Musks's mission to Mars automatically means not funding better medical research, or not buying new tanks. The player god can't have it all.

Because of integration, players of the simulation games can easily understand the consequences of their choices, and learn good from bad choices. In our society, where every choice is considered to be hallowed, learning to see good and bad choices is a valuable lesson.

Recognizing integration today means when a supposed environmentalist is driving to their beloved cottage, they should know, or be told, how much carbon their spewing into the air and be held accountable if the player god says so. Or when a supposed nativist says immigrants are bad, yet he needed many to build his beloved McMansion. Their actions makes them "pro or anti" environment/immigrant, not their personal opinion. In the simulation games choices are tracked to showcase their effectual truth, because every choice is interlinked, something we need today to make better choices.

## That's It

Hopefully that was simple. Hopefully, life's grand story, a society's ruling philosophy, and individual microstories, were all right there, easy to see. The stories of protagonists, vs antagonists, aren't there, but, hopefully you can see where your microstory fits into our real life game of _Civilization_.

There's nothing complicated about seeing a better version of the truth. Like seeing Jupiter's moons, it's supposed to be simple.

The question is, is it simple to you. Because what you're being asked, is what the Inquisition, what all those kings, and peasants, were being asked. To realize their ruling philosophy needs to be upgraded. And just like how we can't blame Aristotle for thinking the Earth didn't move because he didn't have the technology. We can't blame anyone who came before us for being her.

But you don't have that freedom now. You know what the plot is. That means you can stand above it, as a protagonist. If you don't, you're Darth Vader.

We can all see the potential of digital technology. In our misson to empower proactive revolutions with techvolution, we now see society from the top down; like we're looking at it through a lens. Although we often complain about the horrible trends in our society like debt, or climate change, we can now see who is going right, and who is doing wrong, for us, inside our plot of life.

In short we should see what philosophies, policies, technologies, and individuals make a happy society. Because there is a formula for a happy society, we just need the tools to see it. Once we do, we'll judge our political philosophies much faster, and not just accept the philosophy of whichever ruling nobility is in power.

Now watch the video below. And put yourself in Machiavelli's, or Galileo's, or Newton's shoes. When they had those huge realizations about the huge, untapped, potential of humanity, once we throw away a aged ruling philosophy. I personally watch the video below, and am already looking past Mars!

Just think of Google Maps, and it showing you live feeds of traffic, weather, and restaurant reviews. Wait we have those of course. See, I'm not bullshitting you. We already are inside digital _Civilization_. So keep adding stuff! What's the by-laws for opening up a restaurant? Click on the map, and tell the player god you want to open a restaurant, and let digital technology make it a afternon of work, not months of paperwork.

Keep going. New digital modes and orders are so amazing. What happens when the player god notices social capital is low, and so requests a microstory to open up a new bar in a neighborhood. Fuck the free-market, fuck centralized planning, we have digital technology telling us what the Universe looks like, and so we can fulfuill the requirements.

You're future is inside this video. We master our plot. We master our technological development. We rid the world of revolutions. And look forward to techvolution. We have so much potential. Colonies on Mars. Curing cancer. Stopping climate change. Knowing when human life begins. And so much more possible, once we overcome the antagonists.

Antagonist depend on the abstractions

### Taken from Technology trees

The tranistions are huge, and something we need to appreciate in real life a lot better. As society transitions, every building, road, tool, system of government, instantly upgrades to the possibilities of new technology. Moving into the bronze age turns thatched homes into brick buildings, spears into swords, and oral history into written books. Giving humanity a technology road map will help us transition our societys much more easily.

Every new technology and function develop the same way. In its infancy it requires manual labour to make use of. Like clubs and spears. As technology develops it gets stronger, like with swords and bow and arrows. Soon technology gets so strong it requires little human mastery, like guns and soon lasers. The first steps are the growth phase of a function, where humanity fills in for weakness with its own mastery of swordsmanship for example. As technology progresses, it frees humanity from having to master old techologies. Swords were expensive to own, and took years to master. Guns are cheap, and can be learned in a few days.

The growth phase, requires humanity to concentrate together around the limited technology. Not everyone can own master hand to hand combat, or an expensive sword and shield and are thus dependent on the few who can. Yet as technology advances, it moves into the distribution phase, where human mastery is less needed, and thus more people can control their own protection because guns are cheap and can be leared in a few days. Growth and concentration, then distribution and democratization is the pathway to all functions in society.

### Why Are We Unhappy

So are you happy with our society, our way of life, and your place in it. I didn't ask before for no reason. Asking if you're happy is asking if the player god is doing their job. It's a very serious question. Because if you and many people aren't happy, it means we're looking for a new philosophy to let us play the game better.

So why are we unhappy. Compared to most any other time in human history we're freer and more secure. That's why our ruling nobility can't understand the unhappy middle class. When the unhappy attended Bernie Sanders rallies, elected Donald Trump, rioted in Greece, or voted for Brexit, the ruling nobility and their supporters were distraught. Suddenly _they_ had to find a reason for their unhappiness. It proved just as hard (and filled with poor explanations like socialism and racism) for them to explain their feelings, as it's been for the unhappy to explain ours.

The reason neither happy or unhappy can explain themselves is because neither understands their position. We don't have the tools of a simulation game "microscope" to see where we are in the game of life. We let emotions guide our politics because we don't yet have the ability to see the reason for our clicked status.

Using the similuation games gave us a glimse of society through the microscope. It lets us start to see why people are unhappy with liberal free-market economics. Today the happy ruling nobility believes happiness is relative to the suffering of our ancestors, who experienced much disease, hunger, and cold. Since liberl free-market economics solved these horrendoues things, they reason the people should be happy today.

Yet the unhappy believe happiness is relative to the future, not the past. Liberal free-market economics is holding us back from our potential. Our reality of overpaid managers, annoying customers, unaffordable housing, is a daily reminder of this massive under achievement. We sense this under achievement at work the most because the worplace is owned, reported on, managed, and regulated, by the ruling nobility.

The unhappy masses have seen the future. Because in 1968 our player god unlocked the Digital Age. Since then everyone's slowly lived the future when using personal computers, iPhones, and the internet, and it's an awesome world of instant communication, open knowledge, mass equality, little management, and less regulation. Yet out of self-interest the player god refuses to click the upgrade button for the workplace, government, news, learning, and other societal functions. Liberal free-market economics is a non-functioning philosophy in the digital age. Every day since 1968 has only increased the number of unhappy people.
