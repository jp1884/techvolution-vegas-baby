# The Death Star

Midway through _Star Wars_, the ship taking Skywalker, Obi-Wan, Leia, and Solo is captured by the very ship the secret plans were stolen to destroy. It's great writing, because, they have to escape it, so they can destroy it.

Well I hope you took notes Skywalker. Because they got me! The antagonists have me in a Darth Blockbuster choke hold. And I'm in trouble.

See, I broke the rules and they sent their stormtroopers. I was over powered. Not by superior reasoning, philosophy, or ethics. No, they over powered me because some extras joined them! I'm here, like Rapunzel, trapped in the Death Star, under the watch of extras. You have to the secret plans to the rule book. And now have to use them, in order to free me. I'm being well treated and feed, other than being forced to listen to red / blue cable news. Can you convince the extras I'm a good guy? Can you save me?

Oh what did I do? I downloaded a movie from the pirate bay.

Hurry up! Blue / red cable news is showing protesters flying into a Climate Change Strike. I don't know how much longer I got, nevermind the polar bears. Although I think the bears will realize the stupidity before the bristol boards with thousands of air miles do. Help!

## Skywalker Turns on His Lightsaber

Fucking Obi-Wan. How'd he get caught? Caught, I didn't even know they were chasing us. Shit's getting serious. Or shit always is. He'd saying something like that.

So he broke the rules, and the extras agreed, and now he's trapped, and I have to get him out.

Or better put, he broke their rules, and watched a digital movie. The first step is intelligence. Let's go on YouTube and see what we can find on Darth Blockbuster.

An official reporter, talking to valued executives and altruistic artists about a problem they say is hurting society. At least that's how some extras saw these peoples, and thus they turned on Obi-Wan. Well many extras were downloading too, but despite that, it was against the rules. Okay, so we got the basics. Lets use Techvolution, to change all the extras minds.

## Technological History of the Movies

It's funny how going to YouTube solved my problem so quickly. Now, I need to know how movies and television technologically evolved. This would take weeks at a library. But I have Wikipedia so it'll take a few hours. Rubbish indeed professors.

So let's free Obi-Wan.

The first thing to understand, is movies didn't invent stories. We've always told stories and always will. They help us understand our lives and societies. Religious sermons, epic poetry, and stage plays have filled our need of stories throughout the years.

The movies, and later television, are merely tools that help tell stories. Each is merely a creation of three pieces of technology. Data transmission, data storage, and data viewing. Movies started in 1894 when Thomas Edison's laboratory invented the kinetoscope; the first machine that moved pictures through a light source fast enough to give the impression of seamless movement. Hence the name "moving pictures", simplified as "movies".

The kinetoscope was like a vending machine for movies. Customers looked through a peep hole to see clips of boxing matches or dance routines. It was a popular noveltly, kinda like GIFs on Instagram. Edison owned the patents, and created the New Jersey based Motion Picture Patent Corporation (MPPC) to make sure everyone in the young movie industry paid their dues.

After a few years MPPC's interference and legal threats, in what amounted to shakedowns, movie companies moved to Los Angeles to get away. And as new projector technology came, MPPC lost its patent monopoly anyway, and the movie industry was free to grow in LA's good weather, cheap land, and no stiffling corporate hierachies.

Technology kept improving. New projectors could show movies on huge screens. Although reels weren't long enough yet to show long movies. With the new projectors, movie theaters called Nickelodeons (because admission cost a nickel) opened up across the country. The movies were still novelties, showing exotic animal, news reels, or sports highlights.

By the 1920's film reels were long enough to show three act stories. Sound still wasn't synched with film. Instead movies spoke dialogue with subtitles and theatres used live music bands, to communicate plot points.

In 1927 film was finally synchronized with sound, giving movies dialogue and music. For the first time in history, full stories were not limited to a physical theatre. Any movie theatre in the world could show any story. A new storytelling tool was thus created.

The people certainly felt movie majic. The movies attracted millions every week. American industry rushed to control the booming industry. American culture was slowly told on the silver screen. Leading actors became cultural icons. The industry exploded with profits. Although the people controlled none of it, their interest and loyalty made it happen one movie ticket at a time

Of course, all the technology that made the movi eindustry so rich and powerful was physical. Data storage, transport, and viewing was physical film, light projectors, and delivery trucks.

This didn't change until a new tool was born in 1948. Televisions used a different mixture of technologies. Huge magnetic tape reels stored content. Radio transmitted content over the airwaves. And televisions recieved the transmissions and displayed the content on tube televisions.

Broadcasts television companies like NBC, ABC, and CBS, now competed with movie theatres. Story quality wasn't as good, but the convenience was huge. Especially as Americans slowly moved away from the cities packed with movie theatres, into the suburbs packed with TV's.

From the 1950's to the early 1980's nothing much changed in the entertainment industry. Movies and television got better technologies. Film reels got clearer, color, and widescreen. Likewise, televisions got bigger and bandwidth improved with cable. But no new tools were created. The people still couldn't choose or produce their own content.

Then came new tools. The magentic tapes the broadcasters stored their content on got small enough to make Video Cassette Recorder. VCR's cut out the broadcaster, who of course sued Sony for letting people break the rules and "time shift" television shows. The case ended up in the Supreme Court in 1984.

In a 5-4 vote, the extras were free to add the VCR to their cyborgology. The power to record and watch videos was distributed to the people. Of course VCR, home cameras, and renting movies became very popular. The most successful video rental company took the name "Blockbuster; the common term for popular movies. The entertainment industry forgot about its objections, and gladly put its content on Blockbuster's busy shelves.

Home entertainment kept getting better. Soon came DVD's and flatscreen televisions. DVD's were more advanced CD's, and worked similar to videotapes, except they were digital. Meaning data was stored as "1 or 0". Plasma or LCD flatscreens televisions were much bigger then tube televisions, and since they were digital too, they were High Definition.

Even more people rushed to upgrade their cyborgology with DVD's and home theatres. Blockbuster rental stores were even more packed. And people started buying hundreds of DVD's for home libraries. The entertainmetn industry loved it. They didn't even care movie theatre attendence dropped heavily. In fact, they used theatres as marketing hype. The money was in DVD sales.

Although movie theatres kept going bankrupt, the record entertainment industry profits were huge, so they loved DVDs. Yet the data transmission, data storage, and data viewing technologies that made movies, were now almost entirely digital.

Except movie distribution. People still had to drive to pick up their DVD's or less likely go to the theatre. Hence, people still needed to concentrate around movie theatres, rental stores, or TV guides, i.e. the castles with gatekeepers, to acccess their digital data.

Until they didn't.

The internet, the transfer of digital information that was used for email and webpages since the 1970's, had kept getting better and faster. And in the early 2000's the internet got High Speed, and could finally transfer enough 1's and 0's of a DVD faster then someone driving to pick one up.

And here enters places like The Pirate Bay. Like Napster, it introduced digital movies to people first. Altough the entertainment industry used digital camera's, film projectors, email, webpages, YouTube, they wanted the people to keep using DVD's, they even made new ones called Blu-Ray and HD-DVD.

The people wanted the better tool. Pirate Bay was the first to offer it. It was a pain, it was hard to learn, but it was better than driving.

Pirates you might say! People are evil, people are lazy, people are thieves! Really? Then explain the graph below, the one what shows how the evil people responded with protagonist Reed Hastings made a new tool, and distributed its powers to the people. What we call Netflix.

If middle class Americans, Canadians are pirates, why didn't Blockbuster stores have steal bars? The same reason why we don't steal Netflix. Blockbuster was a fair deal, until data streaming was possible. Then Netflix was.

The people elected to download movies from pirate bay or because it was a upgrade available to their cyborgology. The only natural rule is natural selection. The people choose the best tool because with new majic, they evole into better cyborgs. It's not the people's job to wait for an industry to catch up to nature. But the other way around.

Maybe the industry would have noticed that, if they weren't so busy at so many movie premieres, talk shows, award shows, and launch parties. The Oscars, Correspondence Dinners, Emmy's, Golden Globes, Cannes Film Festival, Sundance Film Festival, Toronto International Film Festival, and so many others. All modern version of banquets and balls, with gates to keep you out, and rules put in place to make the good times of the DVD going. Party loving, profit loving, foresight lacking is a recipe for antagonism, hence Darth Blockbuster rose up.

Digital tools empowered the extras to fight back, and check his selfishness. Techvolution tells them its right to do it. As for it being against the rules, it was, and maybe it should be, but do you think Darth Blockbuster will buy back all those DVDs, Blu-Rays, and HD-DVDs he said was better then illegal downloading?

He won't. Because while Darth Blockbuster expects people to follow his rule book, he follows nature's, and doesn't use bad tools himself.

## Decision Time

Well extras, stormtroopers, that's your master. He's a Sith Lord. While he may be a great person, nice to you and his employees, wears nice clothing, tips well, whoever he is doesn't matter. He is an antagonist to society. He fought against video tapes, then jumped on board when they made him money. He fought against interet songs, then jumped on board. Fought against internet streaming, then jumped on board.

What's going to happen when 3D printing threatens his merchandising. Or when Virtual Reality let's people live their own stories. Or whatever! We shouldn't have to argue for new tools! You fight him, or are his Stormtrooper, because you decide the winner between protagonist and antagonist!

Let Obi-Wan go!

No, we can't work with him. You can't stand in the middle. Pick a side.
