# A World With No Majic

Skywalker, the empire is evil. They don't mean to be mean, but they are. They enforce their Death Star rule book to keep their tools in power. From contracts nobody can understand, to regulations nobody reads, to polite behavior advertisers approve of. Our society's biggest problems like personal isolation, politicla hatred, and climate change, are wounds of the Death Star's many laser blasts.

We need Techvolution to fight back. Remember Techvolution is inspired by Nature, where biodiversity empowers life's adaption to environmental changes. In Nature no one says evolution to frontline problems is against the rules. The only natural rule is natural selection.

Because we evolve with tools, we need the same freedom to choose our adaptations. We already have protagonists creating new tools to solve frontline problems. We already have extras feeling the pain of frontline problems. What we don't have is the freedom of extras to majically form bonds with new tools.

Because our natural Techvolution is interrupted by Darth Blockbuster. He takes hold of society's ruling philosophy, and uses it to make rules that intimidate extras. This sucks for extras and protagonists. But it's absolutely horrible for society. Especially ours today.

The Death Star has been busy since the 1970's. That's when protagonists created digital tools en masse, and Darth Blockbuster showed up to stop extras using them to change society. Look at the affects on our personal isolation, politics, and climate.

## Things Won't Change, Until

Most of our problems started in the 1970's for a reason. That's when protagonists's created digital tools, and Darth Blockbuster showed up to keep our car driving, suburban living, broadcast television watching, 9-5 working, unhealthy food eating, univeristy admission test taking lifestyle going. Despite totally new tools, the American way of life hasn't changed. It's still the "American Dream" to live in a post World War II baby boomer suburb.

Thus, red / blue politics fight old fights. They fight to "fairly" allocate the control, regulation, and profit, of limited tools. For example, because university libraries and lecture halls are still considered "formal education", red / blue endlessly debate who should get into university and how the masive expense should be paid. Endless battles over affirmative action, student loan rates, and state education subsidies are the result.

While better tools are ignored. Digital tools can educate anyone willing. Wikipedia, YouTube, Khan Academy, Udemy, Skillshare, Brilliant, The Great Courses, are merely the first new digital education tools. They do wonderful jobs, yet are funded for a tiny fraction of formal education, and get no official support. We don't teach kids to read or update Wikipedia in schools. We don't track their progress in Khan Academy's micro-lessons. We defintely don't recognize "degrees" from Udemy, or YouTube, even though most programmers and designers learn far more there then in any college classroom.

And thus our society suffers. Despite way too much carbon in the atmostphere, housing bubble bursts, massive student debt, and horrible individual health, we keep living the same way, under the rules of a aged ruling philosophy, with rules written by antagonists. Our entire climate is changing because our ruling philosophy is not.

Middle class quality of life, political cooperation, and climate change, won't get better until the extras join the protagonists, step-up to the antagonists, and change their ruling philosophy. Only then will the world change. Our world stays damaged, waiting for Techvolution.

So Skywalker, that's why you need to join rebellion of the mind. Let's look at one of the battles already fought.
