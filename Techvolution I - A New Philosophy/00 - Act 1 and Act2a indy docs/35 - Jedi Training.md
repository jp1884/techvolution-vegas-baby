# Jedi Training

## Introduction

Skywalker, you're doing well. But if you're going to topple Darth Blockbuster, you need to learn the advanced stuff. In the first battle scene, the one with Wikipedia, we learned how new technology is made into new tools, and when a new tool is created, there's a battle between protagonists and antagonists, both reaching for the new tool to make themselves the winner.

Europe's divine nobles kept winning this battle. The nobles spent society's money on their personal banquets, balls, and palaces, until the people revolted with bent up rage. With the benefit of hindsight, the American and French Revolutions are obvious to us. But in real-time, they weren't. It's very hard to interpret the society you're living in. It's not like the nobles wanted to have their heads chopped off.

So, to interpret our society better we need a tool. And that's our Life Star. It will give extras better rules to follow, because their rooted in Nature. Like a telescope or microscope replaced human made rules about the Universe and Nautre, the Life Star will replace the human made rules, with answers rooted in Nature and empower us to see and understand our society better.

The Life Star starts by learning the power of stories.

## Storytelling Indicators

Here's why stories increase our insight into our society.

A story is a protagonist fighting to solve a problem an antagonist defends. They fight in three parts. The first is an introduction to the problem and characters. The second is the battle between good and bad sides. The third part is the conclusoin, where we find out which side wins.

In good storytelling, be it fantasy, romance, or comedy, the sequence of events must be unexpected enough to be interesting, yet logical enough to be believable. Balancing the two is the art of good storytelling because it makes audiences wonder, care, but comprehend, what's going to happen next.

So, stories surprise us, but at the same time, they need to be logical. That means every story element needs a reason to exist, even if we don’t initially understand it. And here’s the connection with Techvolution and our Life Star. Because understanding all the reasoning hidden in stories, helps us understand all the reasoning hidden in our society.

Because we solve problems with new tools. Inventing, and distributing new tools is a story. Invention is fueld by genius, distribution by majic, and both fight antagonists to be created. To master these stories, we have to fully understand stories.

Stories are valuable because they explain why humans act the way we do. The human subconscious will always try to find meaning to any series of events, be it a movie, or a life. The conscious mind will always perceive a series of events. Thus, if a story is logical story, an audiences unconsicous and conscious minds are in alignment, a link develops between the story, and the viewer. When a story isn't logical, is a bad story, it requires bullshit to keep the audience engage. Like how modern blockbuster movies pour on more special effects and stars. The stories suck, but the audience is distracted with the spectacle of explosions, sex, gore porn, and celebreties.

This same thing happens in human societys. When society's story is logical, people inside will function without too much oversight. When however society is non-functioning, spectacle is used to distract the people, and rules are used to keep them in line.

Now, we have to breakdown stories, so we can later make the Life Star.

## Story Parts

Aristotle dissected stories in Poetics. He teaches us all their parts, which are listed below. From the least to the most important.

Items: are the props, of the story. Broom sticks, magic hats, houses. Put them all together and items make the setting, like ancient Rome, galactic space, or suburan American. The items are like the veil. To understand society, means to be able to tell why the items are the way they are.

Passion: Items come alive when somebody gives them passion. The American flag, wedding rings, Nobel prizes. Just items, until someone feels passion about them. People promote and defend their passions in their dialogue.

Dialogue: is the powerful words, whether written of spoken, between characters fighting for their passions. Like Douglass learning to read, and Hugh telling Sophia teaching a slave to read is bad. Dialogue is authority. Because once an idea is spoken, it can spread and become political. Tyrants start by burning books, and controlling the free speech. Change happens first in dialogue. Like Rousseau, who was only dangerous because he wrote good dialogue, to topple the antagonists to change.

Antagonist: defends the society against changes. They use items, passions, and dialogue to do it. However, since an antagonist defends society, he is a servant of, and thus bound by the society's ruling philosophy.

Ruling philosphy: is the philosophy that sets society's rules. Like the "Dark Side" controlling the empire in _Star Wars_, the machines controlling _The Matrix_, or the evil step-family controlling Cinderella. The ruling philosophy isn't created in the story. It already exists. Inside this cave is the reality most people live inside. The ruling philosophy so powerful it controls anyone not a protagonist.

Protagonist: the rulebreakers who see a problem with the ruling philosophy, and fight to replace it with a new one, like Luke Skywalker, Neo, Cinderella. Only protagonists can rise above the ruling philosophy. That's why the protagonist is the story's leader. Their success determines if society will change or not.

Plot: the series of battles between protagonist and antagonist. Usually the plot, and the battles, is about a tool whose creation, or destruction, determines the winner of the story. The Death Star, matrix, and glass slipper, are all tools. Whoever controls them, is the winner of the story.

**Office Space:**  Hits close to home, the story about the boring drugery of modern suburban life and office work. The ruling philosophy is commercialism that gives workers repetitive tasks and keeps them in line with absurd office culture and just enough money to pay their bills. The antagonist is the boss who gets a disproportionate amount of money, prestige, and power.

The protagonist is the guy who values his freedom more then money. The plot rests on whether the protagonist will control the tool, money, to free himself from having to work anymore.

## Charting Stories

What does a healthy story, its events, philosophies, characters, and items, work together.

Here's a legend.

![Legend](\../img\thewriter\story-legend.png)

**Old Society** - The society before the story starts.
**Beginning** - When the protagonist breaks from society.
**Protagonist philosophy** - The good guy acts out his philosophy.
**Antagonist philosophy** -  The bad guy acts out his philosophy.
**Realizations** -  Moments when a character realizes something.
**Suffering of the Protagonist** - Long periods when the protagonists suffers.
**Reversal of Situations** - When the plot changes big time.
**Free will** - The time character's have to act. Small spread is grave danger, big is nothing matters.
**Conclusion** - The final battle.
**New Society** - The result of the battle.

This is the how story's look like. We'll map out the fight over new tools soon. First we have to see the three difference kinds of stories we'll encounter.

## Three Kings of Stories

There are three kinds of stories. One that works, and two that don't for different reasons.

![Functional Story](\../img\thewriter\story-functional.png)
*Functional:* Story parts are well ordered. The story is about an explicit problem. The protagonist wants to change something, and the antagonist doesn't. Both have passion, making them a believable person. As protagonist and antagonist battle, they make a logical yet surprising plot.

The stories problems are logical, and thus the character has time to figure them out. Because it's a functional story the audience cares about the story and its characters. Ex. Cinderella, Shawshank Redemption, Star Wars, Pixar, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, etc.

![Art Story](\../img\thewriter\story-art.png)
**Art:** Story elements are disordered. Character are are emphasized over plot. The story doesn't have an explicit problem. Thus, art stories emphasize character's selfish passions, and are less stories than personal diaries about loves, hobbies, and interests.

Since there is no battle between protagonist and antagonist, the plot is often illogical and inconsequential to outsiders. The separation between plot and character is wide because noting is at stake. The conclusion doesn't change the original reality very much. Ex. "The Cinema", Snow Angels, Wrecked, Spanglish, many Sundance, and TIFF films, etc.

![Spectacle Story](\../img\thewriter\story-spectacle.png)
**Spectacle:** Story elements are disordered. The story is about an obvious problem like the world is ending. Because the problem is so simple, neither the protagonist or antagonist has much character. The divide between character and plot is small.

Spectacle stories emphasize items and effects. The story is about how the protagonist wins, not if. Spectacle is like learning a new toy. It's about having fun with no purpose in mind. Ex. Transformers 1-8, Star Wars 1-3 / 7-9, most sequels and remakes.

**Conclusion:** Art stories don't have a real beginning. Since they aren't about a specific problem they could start at any moment. Spectacle stories have a beginning but are about fighting for survival and not fighting for a new reality. Only functional stories have real beginnings. Because functional stories have a protagonist fighting to replace a reality with their own.

Likewise, only functional stories have conclusions. Conclusions require mixing two proposed realities and making a new one. Conclusions are also where plot and character share importance. Because at the conclusion the characters actions are so important, they directly affect the plot.

![After the story ends](\../img/thewriter/distribution-star_wars.png)

And this is the important part. When any story ends, all story elements, all characters, all items and thoughts, return to being equal. Because the plot that bound them is over, and thus each waits for a new story to give them life and purpose, and give anyone the chance to be the new hero.

For example, in _Star Wars_ Once the Death Star is blown up, Light Side defeated the Dark side. Thus, Luke is no longer the protagonist, Vader isn't the antagonist, dialogue isn't controlled by the need to destroy/save the Death Star, passions can follow something else, and items are just things again. The hierarchy becomes a circle in a time of equality.

Importantly, since spectacle and art stories don't have stories, they can't have conclusions. So they continue growing indefinitely. Thus art is followed with more art, and spectacle is followed with more spectacle. They never end.

Until people inside reality realize the divine nobles bankrupted their entire society.

## Small example

Taking what we've learned about story elements, and the three kinds of stories, let's look back at what we've learned about the creation and distribution of new tools.

Spectacle is how tools are first made. Basically we toy with new technology, trying to figure out what it can do. Spectacle works best here because it's easy and cheap. For example, pornography was one of the first book topics printed, and online pornography quickly spread on the early world wide web.

After toying around, we learn what the tool is capable of, and start applying it to real world problems. Here a new tool enters the functional stage. Where protagonists question society, and continually break the rules to push society forward.

Then comes the third stage, art and spectacle. A new tool only has so much problem it can solve. After Charles Martel and Charlemagne built the castles, standing army, and judges, that returned peace and order to western Europe. This was the functional stage of history.

Naturally, once civilization returned to Europe, its members should have returned to being equals. Yet, since they didn't have Techvolution, Europe waited for a revolution to return equality. In the meantime, the story becaome a mixture of art and spectacle. The nobles lived a art story, one based on fueling their selfishness with expensive props. And spectacle, used to distract the people from the the non-functioning story.

![After the story ends](\../img\thewriter\techvolution-story-types-applied.png)

And this moment in the human story, is what Techvolution is designed to overcome. When we identity the problem our society is meant to overcome, we can have more funtional stories about overcoming problems, and less art stories about spending money one ourselves.

And that's what Rousseau noticed. That society was past due its moment of conclusion. That instead of protagonists becoming equal again, and distributing the proceeds of a new tool throughout society, the leaders descendants kept it for themselves.

## Ruling Philosophy

That means we today are living in a art and spectacle story. Art is what the establishment enjoys, palaces and banquests and balls. The extras are bombareded with spectacle, to distract from tools that aren't up to date with the recent problems, but are made fancier instead.

Duplication...?

Like any story, our ruling philosophy should have a goal. With goals come a natural conclusion. Protagonists are heroes because they set to overcome's the stories problem, and therefore become special, or divine.

However, in stories when the problem is overcome, the hero returns to being a regular person. Unfortunately, people took the nobles divine right to rule literally. Stuck inside their ruling philosophy, the nobles were protagonsits in their eyes, while being "Darth Kings" to history.

Similarly, on ruling philosophy as no conclusion built in. Ask any Darth Blockbuster you want, managing partner at a consultanting firm, high priced lawyer, music executive, Professor of Distinguished Chair of Media Studies, when they will return to being equal. They won't even know what the fuck you're talking about. They're divine!

They use art and spectacle to hide their dysfunction. Real heroes want to end the fight, and return home to their friends and families. They don't want the praise, they want to overcome the problem.

- Perpetual functional story. Techvolution is the perpetual functional story. Because people are free to choose their own tools, and thus can solve their own problems. They can't live in art/spectacle, inside an ecosystem.

NEXT is Polar Bears in the Amaxon...

- stories need ecosystems, members only clubs, otherwise it's a deux ex.
  
- ## Natural Indicators

In ecosystems, lifeforms excesses are checked by the food chain. Which is good, because balanced and flowing resources means all lifeforms live, probe, and adapt to problems. Europe's nobility was hoarding resources, this alone is a clear indication their ruling philosophy, and its rules, was past its usefulness. It was contrary to Nature.

We can see the same problem in more details when we analyze stories.
