# Nice to Meet You, Skywalker

And the story begins. Not in a foreign city, mythical world, or galaxy far far away. Right here and now, whereever you are on this Earth. We need to change up ruling philosophy to take advantage of digital tools. Only you can decide who should win, in the battle between old and new philosophies.

A little about me first. I'm nobody special. In my youth I was a cleaner, drywaller, movie usher, and die-hard ideologue. After dropping that bad habit, I studied technological innovation at the University of Toronto while working full-time. I'm (grudginly) grateful a nagging stutter made me too shy to leave the frontine after graduation. I learned far more about our politics and economics continuing to work as a line worker, an account manager, a claims adjuster. Trying to help by making an app and meeting my personal Darth Blockbuster was a education on its own. All this taught me Techvolution.

So that's a snapshot. But I'm not too important. You are. Because from car detailing to internet technical support, nursing to adjusting, only workers on the frontline know the tools our society needs to fix our many problems.

So although today you're an extra in battle between Jedi and Sith, you are the hero of Techvolution. It's not surprising. Average joes are always the heroes. Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Neo, Cinderella were regular people. They became heroes when called upon to defeat the bad guys.

Now you're called upon. Like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Morpheus, or the fairy godmother, I'm merely the guide to teach you how to defeat the villians. So the time is now young Skywalker, to leave the farm, and join the rebellion.

What is the rebellion. It's definitely not rallies, marches, or protests. It's a rebellion of the mind. We have to change our ruling philosophy. We have to destroy the Death Star, for it kills off new tools, and make e Life Star that loves new tools.

After we do, every frontline person will choose their own tools at school, home, or work, helping the Jedi defeat Darth Blockbuster.
