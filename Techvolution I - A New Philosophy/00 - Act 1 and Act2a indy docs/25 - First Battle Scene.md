# First Battle Scene

## Introduction

In the 1970's the transistor, internet, computer monitors, and other digital technology, started to leave labs and research centres and make their way into products. Finally, after centuries of limited tools, society had ones cheap enough to mass produce, yet powerful enough to change our way of life. Of course, that's when Darth Blockbuster appeared and went to work defending his way of life.

Some examples. In the 1970's AT&T defended their telephone monopoly by successfully lobbying government to ban Americans from using internet modems. In 1984, the entertainment industry defended broadcast television by unsuccessfuly suing home video recorders. In 2001, the music industry defended music Compact Discs by successfully suing digital songs. Throughout society the antagonists found ways to prevent the majical possibilities digital tools offered society to technologically evolve.

The antagonists even resisted help. As Napster was introducing digital songs to America, and being sued for it, Steve Jobs wanted to improve digital songs with iTunes. Music executives had already tried and failed horribly. With no options, and despite the supposed crisis of Napster, Jobs said he'd " never spent so much of my time trying to convince people [music exceutives] to do the right thing for themselves".

The problem wasn't Napster. It was Darth Blockbuster. New tools questioned who should be on top. So the the people on top resisted change, even from Steve Jobs. From Galileo to Washington, Tesla to Jobs, the battle between antagonits, protagoinsts, and extras has always been the same. Here's how it breaks down.

## How New Tools Start the Fight

Technological evolution is like its biological cousin. There are adaptations of existing lifeforms, and totally new lifeforms. In technology this the difference between a new technology, and a new tool.

Upgrading a technology is an iterative change, like going from Sedan's to SUV's, tube televisons's to LCD's, VHS to DVD's. Each is different technologically, but they do the same job, so no political battles are started. No new majic is required to attract users.

But when we've upgraded enough technologies, like microchips, touchscreens, batteries, and WiFi, a genius can unlock a new tool like smartphones. And this is a big deal.

Why? Well, because creating a new tool asks a climactic and political question: who controls it? After all, whoever does, is more powerful. The weilder can let extras majically connect with new tools to solve their problems. Or withold new tools and convince the extras to keep using old tools with techniques like advertising, culture, and spectacle. Techniques I call dark majic. Like heavily advertised muscle cars with V8 horsepower in the era of Teslam dark majic keeps extras holding an old tool.

Thus, while civilization is a struggle to overcome problems by upgrading technology and inventing new tools, it’s also a battle to control them. The people with the old tool fight to retain their power, while inventors and innovators imagine a new society that shares it.

The eternal story of civilization is thus protagonists making new tools, antagonists attacking new tools, and many extras watching them fight. Our politics is an ongoing history of technological change, with protagonist and antagonist both reaching for the tool to make themselves the winner.

Today the extras are not self-aware of their power to decide the winner. I’ll show you how important you are. Here’s how you changed the world just by being curious and loving majic.

## Extras Killed Wikipedia's Evil Twin

The environment keeps changing. Life needs to know how, and uses its lifeforms to probe for answers. Similarly, people always have some nagging question. Like how Tesla engine works, or what happened to the electric car. Constant questions are a problem and we need a reference tool to solve it. True to ourselves, we make one with the technology available and upgrade it when possible.

Our first reference tool was the wisdom of our elders. The first technological upgrades were papyrus scrolls and ink (500 BC) and books (500), which turned some elders into experts like Hippocrates and Aristotle. When wood-pulp paper (1200) and the printing press (1456) were invented, humanity unleashed mass-produced books. Now experts could share knowledge between themselves and educate the masses. We called the reference books encyclopedias.

People loved encyclopedias. For the first time, many answers were available on demand. The _Encyclopedia Britannica_ (1878) was the standard. It went into continuous publication (1933) to keep people updated to the latest facts. In the following decades, the computer, digital printer, and telecommunications meant encyclopedias were written and stored digitally. But they remained a set of printed books and CD's controlled by experts.

Then came the world wide web (1991), a new technology that unlocked many new tools like websites, forums, blogs, and something called “wikis”. Wiki software lets anyone write or edit a webpage by pressing “edit now”. All changes are saved, so anyone can erase errors or vandalism by pressing “undo now”. For years programmers used wikis to collaboratively write technical manuals.

As web tools boomed in the late ’90’s, protagonist Jimmy Wales wondered if the web could upgrade encyclopedias. Today, most of us who were curious about things electric cars know our quest ends with a free online encyclopedia anyone can edit called Wikipedia. But it didn’t start out that way.

Wikipedia started as Nupedia (2000). Nupedia was a free online copycat of Encyclopedia Britannica where only “expert” professors made articles. Wikipedia (2001) was a side project. Only programmers knew “community content creation” would work.

Everyone else assumed regular people would only read the work of professors. The first issue with this theory was that the professors didn’t like to share their knowledge. In its first year, Nupedia had 12 articles. Wikipedia had 40,000, which most professors loved to belittle as rubbish, and disallowed students from referencing them in their papers. Yet professors refused to improve, or to assign students to improve, Wikipedia.

The second issue was that it turned out “expert” answers and “regular” answers are the same. Electric cars us A/C motors no matter who says it. And thirdly, most importantly, Wikipedia made majic so easy many extras became protagonists! A huge community of non-academics voluntarily shared their knowledge one “edit now” at a time and fiercely protected their common knowledge with “undo now”. Nobody told them, paid them or made a rule to encourage it. Because performing majic is its own reward.

And lastly, the remaining extras flocked to Wikipedia. While most people didn't contribute, they still ignored the rules, and felt the majic of learning a new tool to help them answer their questions. The extra’s mass support quickly made Wikipedia king, while giving Nupedia and Encyclopedia Britannica quick deaths.

That’s the story of Wikipedia. Made by new protagoinsts, made the standard reference tool by empowered extras. Few believed it was possible, because even professors don’t understand new tools always unpower the few, to empower the rest. Interestingly, after I finally conceded temporary defeat to my personal Darth Blockbuster, I uploaded a few pages to Wikipedia instead. Not as helpful as my app, but it took just a few weeks of work, and one “edit now” button, to make it real. It felt majical to bypass the rules.

## You Can Win

Wikipedia's victory is another example of the archetypal human story. Like Galileo and his telescope, George Washington and his musket, and Steve Jobs and his iTunes. Wikipedia was a victory for protagonists against antagonists. What makes it especially cool, is the extras played such a big part.

And that’s the story Skywalker I want you to join with lightsabers a-blazin’, dicing up old tools like evil storm troopers, to smooth out humanity’s natural evolution. In addition to Wikipedia, StackOverflow, GitHub, Bitbucket, Vimeo, and many others are empowering individuals to become protagonists.

Note however, our lives cut across thousands to millions of problems. Thus, our villians are not in a massive group like “the rich” or the “the unions” as old philosophies label. Our villians reveal themselves inside thousands of companies, institutions, and organizations, by suppressing majic of new tools, so they can keep their version of the DVD alive.

The extras can kill all these Darth Blockbusters. I know this because our battle today was fought generations ago with his master, Darth King.

Darth King lived inside palaces, using society’s money to host splendid banquests and balls. His absolute power was hidden inside a ruling philosophy of the “noble’s divine right to rule”. Slowly, as protagonists invented scientific instruments, books, and guns, a new philosophy was born. A philosophy of science and enlightenment, political equality and democracy, made real when the protagonists and extras fought as one in the American and French Revolutions. They were inspired by the new philosophy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau.
