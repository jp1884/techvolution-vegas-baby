# Where did Rousseau's Ideas Come From

## Science

The first modern protagonist was Niccolo Machiavelli (1469-1527). He was born was poor, but his father got him many books from the recent printing press, and mixing a commoner upbriging with new tools, proved itself again to be a recipe for protagonism.

Machiavelli read much Greek and Roman history and philosophy and soon thought religion was over used in his time. This helped him be the first person to see through Europe's ruling philosophy. Machiavelli foresaw a new ruling philosophy where humanity overcomes problems, by using human reason to build new tools. Religion was a crutch, and now an especially unneeded crutch for a society with the printing press and scientific instruments. Humanity could master the many misfortunes of nature with new tools.

If, Machiavelli said, humanity were to wise up, and ignored the "imagined world" of the old ruling philosophy and judge human actions for their "effectual truth" on making the real-world better or not based on the problems on the frontline. Machiavelli appreciated Christianity once brought civlization back to Europe. But new tools need new ruling philosophies. Something he called new "modes and orders".

People the call for "effectual truths" was answered. A chorus of people started to question the ruling philosophy in astronomy, religion, medicine, politics, and more. As ever more technologies got invented and adopted throughout Europe, scientists like Francis Bacon developed the Scientific Method, which was a systematic way to test and find effectual truth. Starting with Copernicus's _On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres_, scientists like Galileo, Kepler and Newton overcame much religious opposition from the ruling philosophy when they participated in the Scientific Revolution (1543-1687.

There were many battles, but scientific truths replaced religious ones inside Western Civilization's scienctific DNA. And Christianity was itself liberated from having to answer questions it simply wasn't meant to. Alas, it was these scientists, inspired by Machiavelli, who set the standard for furture movements against the divine rights of the nobility ruling philosophy.

## Political Protagonists in The Age of Enlightenment

The Scientific Revolution discovered many wondrous details of the universe. Things like the Earth revolves around the Sun, human anatomy, and the laws of motion. Scientists made using the Holy Bible the basis of all human thought look silly. While most of these scientists were faithful Christians in their personal beliefs, they advocated using science as humanity's new and improved ruling philosophy for understanding how the natural world worked. They were thus revolutionaries.

And it was in their tradition of questioning the natural world, that spawned the Age of Enlightenment (1687-1789). The Enlighenment was when humanity itself "wised up" by directing scientific questions to better understand not just physical nature, but human nature.

Now Thankfully, it wasn't long before dress wearing, banquest obsessed, cake eating, self-described divine nobles, were under the spotlight of effectual truth.

Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679), writing during the chaos of the English Civil Wars, started the long process to give Europe a new political ruling philosophy. He started it by defending an absolute monarchy, saying a super strong government is the cure against chaos. Hobbes said everyone should obey one king, who he called Leviathan, to avoid the anarchy that makes human life that is "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." This was revolutionary.

Because how Hobbes justified his nobility was monumental. Like Machiavello, Hobbes disliked religion, so he didn't use the "divine right to rule". Instead, he said humanity is naturally, in our State of Nature, equal. The State of Nature is a place without government, where we're all equal because... well whose to say otherwise. Hobbes biggest proof of our equality is, without government, we can all kill each other with our ability to scheme, plot, and murder. So to keep everyone from killing each other, the people should forfeit their natural rights of equality to a Leviathan to ensure everyone's security.

Thus, _the King_ and _the People_, would have a social contract with each other. One based on equality, that ends in complete tyranny, but that guarantees everyone's security, which as we've learned before is the soil that grows a healthy civilization. This reasoning, believe it or not, started the liberalism that we have today. From constitutions, to the right to own property like race cars, and the right to control ones body with abortions, all guaranteed by the social contract between the people, and Leviathan, or what we call government. Guaranteed if these rights didn't threaten the country's all important security.

We'd recognize Leviathan better after reading John Locke (1632-1704). Locke says it's too idealistic to expect one person to be Leviathan. If power corrupts, then absolute power corrupts absolutely. Thus, Locks says its best to divide government's Leviathan powers up in executive, legisative, and judicial branches. Each would "check and balance" each other, to prevent a government that's worst than the anarchy it's supposed to get rid of.

Locke's philosophy is behind our written constitutions, bills of rights, elected governments, citizens right to bear arms, checks and balances between executives, elected legislatures, lawful judges, freedom of speech, and freedom of religion. Mass printed books, guns, scientific instruments and many others, were enshrined by Locke into society's ruling philosphy, via constitutions, which finally replaced the Holy Bible as society's ultimate reference guide for our ruling philosophy. Most people today live under Locke's Leviathan.

## Revolutions

Rousseau (1712-1778) liked, but disagreed with, Locke and Hobbes. Yes, humanity is naturally equal, but said humanity is only murderous in a society. If a thinker goes back farther into human nature and history, they'd find happy-go-luck hunter gatherers who weren't filled with the envy, jealously, or anxiety of modern humans living under unnatural ruling philosophies. This is where the Rousseau's new philosophy, "Man is born free; but everywhere he is in chains" that we discussed earlier came from. Rousseau says yes society needs a social contract, but one that harnesses the natural goodness of humanity.

Rousseau thus keeps Hobbes' social contract, but wants to create a new person to live inside it. Rousseau's Leviathan is not concentrated into a single person, or even a checked and balanced government, but is distributed throughout society via direct democracy. Meaning there are no representatives of government inside a nobility, or a elected representatives. Instead, all people who live under the all powerful Leviathan, also control the Leviathan.

To have this new society, requires a totally "new person". Someone who can give responsible commands to society, while accepting the rules society gives back.

Once Locke and Rousseau's ideas spread, nation states emerged from the feudal kingdoms. Wars continued to decline, because once the extras fighting the wars on the battlefield, is ruling their society, they don't tend to want more wars than absolutely necessary. Empowering the people breeds collaboration not competition.

Politically free democracies, while not uniform, or everywhere, are now the norm in the world. The ruling philosophy dreamed by Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau, was also dreamed by many Cinderella's, and made real by the people into a new ruling philosophy with many revolutions. Now Cinderella just needed her glass slipper.
