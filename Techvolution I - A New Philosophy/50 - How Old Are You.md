# CHAPTER ONE - THE PROBLEM

## What's Our Problem

How old are you. Simple question solved by simple math. Start from your birth day and count how many times you've circled the Sun. It's a fact in all our laws, religions, and science. When we compare each other, objects, or thoughts, we use birthdays. That is how we tell time.

What if someone told you, like a witch or magician, when you die. Would you still count the days past? Or would you start counting the days left? Wouldn't we live better if we knew our deathday? No more thinking we'll make up for wasted time "later". How many days in traffic, useless meetings, or stress inducing interviews are fueled with "later‚Äù? Later implies endless life, stories, and growth. Later is a lie. That's why no stories are about later. Because the stories worth telling happen now. To really live, we must realize our story ends.

If we want a great life, we need to know our deathday. Outside of an asteroid hitting the planet, a rare disease, or some other calamity, let's find it. Let's invent a technology to find it. We'll give you life by telling you when you die. How exciting! Better yet, you can control this technology; the more good choices you make, the better health you have, and the more life you buy.

Enter our first problem. We don't know what good choices are. Today we notice trends and point out "good choices" with diets, religions or ideologies. But there's a gap in knowledge for your specific life. Because your choices are not tailored for your genetics, diet, or circumstance. To give you more life, we must know much more about yours.

So, our new technology must track everything you eat and do. Only then can we empower you to buy better health and live a better life. We'll get to work. Once we're done making this new technology would you buy it? Maybe for someone's birthday?

Don't, because you already own it. So do you all your friends. Even your enemies. Your body is that technology. Your body tracks exactly what you do, and determines your health. Outside of calamity, your choices do determine how healthy you'll be and when you'll die.

So why don't we know more about our health? Why is our deathday and good choices such a mystery. The problem isn't our bodies. Nature did a great job. Our natural senses can't tell us our health because our prosperous economy made us independent of natural limitations. Prosperity gave us unfettered choices. Our natural senses can't read our biology fast enough to compensate. Smell, touch, taste, sight and sound are not good enough to warn of diabetes, cancer, or depression. Thus, it takes years for our unfettered choices to becomes problems big enough to notice with our biological tools. Today we compensate with medicine to reduce bad health and recommend better choices. We're getting better. Still each person doesn't know, at the point of decision, which choice is good or bad. So we live in ignorance and in bad health.

This is good news. Because our new technology can be simpler. It only needs to augment our natural senses. We need to track what we eat and do, and regularly test our bodies. We need to use technology to proactively assess own biological tools. This way we can analyze which choices improve, or hurt, our health. Thus, we can buy more days, know our futures, and finally enjoy our stories.

What will happen when we invent this miraculous tool? Let's look at history. What happened when we invented the modern glass mirror? Imagine what it was like seeing your physical self for the first time. No more guessing, no one else's opinion, no more using a polished piece of metal; only the truth. The modern mirror is a very advanced technology. It was made in the 14th century but not perfected and mass produced until the 19th century. Today, mirrors show us a reality we all take for granted. A mirror empowers you to see your face, your technique, your youth, your wounds, your smile. Now we are inventing a new mirror. A new technology that similarly shows us the truth in real time. And what will happen when we see our psychological selves as if looking at a mirror?

We get a more accurate reality. Don't say it's impossible. The infinite Universe dazzles us (whenever we look) to know impossible is nothing. And today we looked and invented a small little idea, we're only waiting on the technology to make an "anti-aging" tool to make it real. We will invent it, and mass produce it too. Because life wont let us throw away the prosperity that grants us unfettered choices. So we must adapt ourselves to it. Thus, human decision making and taste will get augmented by a new tool. We will solve our poor health with a new psychological mirror.

In fact, we already are. Fitbits, smartwatches, and genetic testing, are just the beginning. We're on the path to showing ourselves the consequences of our actions in real time. So, our new technology isn't even new, it's been in development for decades. Life is a trickster, it's made modern tools by making it a toy so that we wouldn't realize how that toy will change who we are by showing us the consequences of our self-indulgence. Even if we didn't realize it, we'll soon see our psychological selves in a new mirror. No more polished pieces of metal, opinions, or guesses. Soon we'll see the truth.

The truth is we'll probably never know our deathday. But we'll get close. We'll see which choices give us vitality. The vitality to live a great story. Because knowing how many steps you took yesterday, tells you how many steps you could take today. And knowing how many total steps you've taken, roughly tells you how many days you have left to take them. Technology will show us, and everyone around us, our vitality. Our biological sense will get augmented. And after that, we'll be empowered to live like we're dying. We'll have the best of both worlds. We'll have a prosperous economy and the ability make good choices inside it. Because the truth of a mirror is too clear to ignore.

Hopefully. Beause the question isn't are we inventing new tools. We always are. The question is asking what we'll do when it gets here. Will we embrace it or reject it? Will we empower ourselves with a better reality, or stay weak inside a lie?

Questioning "individuality" to eat whatever you want, burn as much carbon as you want, buy whatever you want, is the ruling philosophy that new tools will question, and techvolution must help ourselvse to erase.

Let's look at the past for a glimpse into our future. When the first mirror showed a new world, and questioned the ruling philosophy.That is the question every extra is being asked now. Denial, delays adaptions, and builds us to a revolution. And acceptance of technology is adaptation, and is techvolution.

## How It Happened Before

Every birthday party used to be  a celebration the Sun revolved around you. The Earth was stationary, and the stars, galaxies, and Universe that surround our little solar system was basically a lightshow. That's all we could see with our eyes.

Ancent Greek astronomer and mathematician Aristarchus of Samos (310-230 BC) said otherwise. Among his achivements he correctly figured out the relative sizes of the Moon, Sun, and Earth. Every year a well in Egypt had no shadow. He reasoned the Sun is directly above it. On the same day he measured the shadow the great Tower of Alexandria. He measured the distances and heights of everything, used the pythgorean theorem, and voila, the Sun is 80 times the size of Earth, and the Moon is one forth. Aristarchus thereafter said why would the Sun move if it's so much bigger.

Aristarchus was right, but his argument still lost. If the Earth moved so much, Aristarchus had to explain why the stars don't move positions. He said the stars were other Suns, but just extremely far away. Extremely far away seemed too weird when humanity measued things in feet. So Aristarchus lost out to Aristotle's opinion the Earth was stationary, and the Sun revolved around it.

Most everyone in all cultures and religions agreed. It's a mark of Ancient Greece genius that it thought of both options, made astronmical systems for both, and choose Aristotle because his evidence seemed better. And it wasn't until Issac Newton in 1687 finally settled the debate. Until 1687 it was rational to be wrong.

Thus, when Copernicus rediscovered Aristarchus during the Renaissance around 1514, he started thinking irrationally. It was around the same time Machiavelli told Europe to disregard tradition and find the "effectual truth". Modernity, the line of reasoning from Machiavelli to Rousseau, started by being irrational. Thus even though Copernicus finished a early copy of _On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres_ in 1532, he didn't want to publish it because he feared the scorn "to which he would expose himself on account of the novelty and incomprehensibility of his theses".

Contrary to some opinions, the religiously minded scholars of Europe, going through the wars between Catholics and Protestants, were not immediately hostile to Copernicus. Many were curious. Copernicus had a reputation for intelligence. When he said the Earth moved people were curious. It was fine to even talk about it, and even argue about it. As previously discussed, Europe was just obessesed about preventing political collapse, because even centuries after Rome's collapse, they feared the chaos. So people just couldn't say the Earth moved was the truth. Truth only has one definition, and two definitions starts political collapse.

Copernicus's book was almost pure math. Most people, regardless of social status, couldn't understand it. Thus they were extras in the story of whether the Earth moved or not. The backlash started when rogues brought Copernicus's message to the extras. Because the rationality of the ruling philosophy was questioned. Until Newton, any argument for Earth moving was irrational. Thus, the rogue's had to make irrationality arguments about the truth. The best example of the rationality of irrationality was Friar Bruno (1548-1600).

Bruno's life could fill volumes. He was a protagonist in every sense of the word. He rose above the ruling philosophy of Aristotle and Christian theology. Born in 1548 he became a priest in 1572 and studied theology in a monastary, getting his doctrate in 1575. He was investigated for having controversial theological views (more extremely minor details like thinking Jesus was a being separate from God). He was persecuted and frustrated enough to flee his monastic order in 1576. He was excommunicated and spent the next 16 years travelling western Europe.

Bruno was poor. He worked at a printer, he taught Latin, and did what he needed to make the rent. He taught in University for a few years before Protestants kicked him out. He was a known rebel to everyone still obessesed with the ruling philosophy. That's probably why all three major western religions, Catholics, Calvinsits, and Lutherans, all excommunicated him. Today that would be like the USA, China, and Russia all hating you.

If you met Bruno you'd know why was so hated. He was irrational. That's why he could understand the truth better than almost everyone else. Even more then Copernicus, Bruno imagined the Universe for what it is today. Other stars, with other planets, with other lifeforms. Millions and millions of miles away from Earth. The rational people simply couldn't understand this imagination.

Ever talk to a homeless man? Not the one whose job was outsourced, the the drifter, or the one on drugs. The quiet guy who walks around talking to himself, too obsessed with his own thinking to do much of anything else. He's homeless, but a perfectly nice person content with his own thinking.

So walks around inside the reality only he knows. He loves when anyone agrees with him, but almost nobody can because he can't even describe it. He's perfectly happy inside his own reality.

Until you take him out of that reality. Until you tell him that reality isn't real. That in fact he's living a lie. That he should change. Then you'll see the nice man become a guardian and defend his reality like a parent defending a child. No moderation is possible. Stubborn, asshole, foolish, crazy, many names label that homeless man. It's best to leave the man alone, let him be, and let him live inside his own world.

If you've ever talked to someone like that, if that sounds familiar, then you've talked to Friar Bruno. The difference is Bruno didn't have a unique reality he was happy to live within. He had a unqiue reality he demanded others live in. The Earth moved damn it! The Sun was the center of the Universe! Listen up!

That's why Bruno's life wasn't spent walking around Naples, minding his own business, as another forgotten homeless man. It was spent writing, lecturing, debating everyone and everything in all of western civilization. He pissed off everyone because Bruno argued for the rationality of irrationality.

Because Bruno was a bit off, he could disassociate with the human world, and see the truth modern technology made possible. Bruno had a stream of realizations, a stream of majic in his head. He struggled to explain the rationality to anyone else, because well, it wasn't rational yet.

He was the tip of the spear. The one who bore the burden of being the first to cross the dangerous river. His free mind, which makes many men homeless, made him point to the future. He was rewarded with publications and fame, and punished with scorn and infamy. He never gave up. Many people were his antagonists. Occasionally regular people with their stubborn beliefs, but usually it was high ranking clergy and political leaders who attacked him, usually with dialogue in spoken threats or written condemnations. He was finally burned at the stake.

Bruno story is the same as Socrates, Rousseau, Hobbes, Machiavelli, Copernicus, and so many other protagonists. All of whom questioned the ruling philosophy, threatned the ruling nobility, and pushed the human race forward. They all show the rationality of irrationality. which is otherwise called wonder. And wonder is the tool of the extra. Because anyone can wonder, and once anyone wonders, they open themselves up to new answers.

And today, the extras need to wonder what they see, and will see, in the telescope of digital technology. The lesson is the same for our telescope. The one that will showcase the errors in our ruling philosophy of liberal free-market economics. It will showcase details about our economics that so far are irrational to mention. But who is responsible for climate change? Which individuals fly the most, drive the most, consume the most, that our fucking planet is boiling. Who over claims on insurance. Which communities, which persons take more than they contribute. Who resists accountability that the telescope will reveal to us.

The telescope will show us we need economic ecosystems. We need to create communities, with a strict divide between members and non-members, to force everyone to collaborate to use local resources much more efficiently. We need to create technology, to showecase the effectual truth of all the world's cultures and peoples, in order to give individuals the economic freedom they have in politics.  We must be camels living in the desert, and anacondas in the Amazon.

The self-declared smart will probably never get techvolution. For the same reason why few accepted Copernicus, Bruno, Machiavelli, and the rest. Changing the ruling philosophy makes them stop attending banquets and balls celebrating their nobility and instead get back to work.

The extras in the story of society are the only ones free enough to make themselves into the futures protagonists. And today's extras are the struggling middle class. And the question is, will they. They certainly should. But we only find out if they will in the story's climax.

## Stuttering ~~Helped~~ Helps Me Know My Thing

My first language was gibberish. No joke. Until grade 3 nobody had much idea what the heck I was talking about. Most people's speech dysfluency (saying "ah", "eh", "umm") is about 5% of their words. Mine was probably 80%. Come grade 3 my teacher and the school's special education teacher told my parents I needed an assessment to find out what was wrong.

I still remember that intelligence test. All sorts of questions and assessments. I was asked to tell a story from a picture, do lots of match questions, and I worked on the equations with imaginary numbers on my knee for some reason. Among some pluses and minuses, speech therapy was recommended (and thankfully) paid for by the school board. So I was a nine year old, being told by a psychologist, I had a problem with my genetics, and I needed therapy, grueling therapy at times, to fix my genetic problem.

Speech Therapy helped a lot. Specialists using techniques and tools to help me overcome my problem. My dysfluency was at about 80%. Still very noticeable at times, and still hard to live with, but way better.

Now, imagine people prone to depression, eating disorders, or addictive behavior. Today these people only meet their specialist after suffering years of depression, being way over or under weight, or with needle marks in the arms. They suffer because they don't know themselves. And everyone's got a thing to work on, be it arrogance, self-pity, shyness, or whatever.

Yet, whatever we have, is hidden by our own ruling philosophy of liberal free-market economics. Extra's are meant to be consumers, to build an economy. At first extras worked a lot, bought a little, and improved their lives with every new sweater, or home heater. Yet now, with the technology of tomorrow like Netflix, being reisted by the technology of yesterday like Blockbuster, extras are still told to consume. Our problems are indulged with massive material wealth, but ignored by the ProCons.

My gift was having a problem easily detectable by our biology. Yet most people have something that's not. The technological mirror we are making with FitBits, smart watches, big data, and so much more, will start revealing our many unseen problems to us. And it's _exactly_ like how the mirrors inside the telescope showed the Universe to Galileo and the ruling nobility. Our telescope will reveal truths our ruling philosophy doesn't want us to realize. It will let us make many more Netflixes, the ruling nobility Darth Blockbuster don't want to see.

Yet you are not the ruling noble. You are an extra. You can choose between technologies. Which means you can choose between ruling philosophies. Will liberal free-market economics be the last ruling philosophy we'll ever need. Probably not. So when is its conclusion.

It's whenever you the extra choose to pickup, and hold new technology, and use it to change the grandstory. You can do that, because techvolution lets you see our world in new detail, where inside we live to invent and distribute new technology to help life prosper. The question is, will you realize the need to look into the mirror and see the new and better truth. Everything the ProCons will argue back at is rational. The key is to instead follow the rationality of irrationality.

mention stanford, or marshmellow tests as mirrors?
