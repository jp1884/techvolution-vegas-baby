## Fighting For The Internet Age - Our Philosophy is Already Generations Behind Our Technology

The Internet Age seeded itself a long time ago. Starting way back in 1843, inventors like Ada Lovelace, Vannevar Bush, and Alan Turing were building the first experimental computers. At the same time, writers like H.G. Wells, Isaac Asimov, and Gene Roddenberry imagined what life would be like once the Industrial Age ended and advanced computers ruled the world.

These authors' stories, such as _War of the Worlds_, _I, Robot_, and _Star Trek_ thought of a future so hard to grasp people called it science fiction. Then came the 1970s; when microprocessors, personal computers, the internet, and other digital technology became actual products on store shelves.

Here started the Internet Age. And it transformed the world just as much as science fiction said it would.

With every purchase, renovation, and birthday gift since 1970, we've been filling our society with fundamentally different technology. It's easy to under-appreciate how a single laptop can be so many machines: a typewriter, radio, book, television, photo album, calculator, draft table, voice recorder. One modern person easily has all these capabilities at her disposal. An Internet Age person can be very self-sufficient.

In contrast, mechanical tools of the Industrial Age are single-use, can't be easily shared, and need many workers and managers to work. An Industrial Age person is by default quite interdependent.

The first mechanical tools, such as weaving looms and drill presses, significantly sped up our manufacturing. However, they were so large and expensive that printers, blacksmiths, and other specialists couldn't afford to own their own tools anymore. Main Street gradually lost out to the industrial production line and the big companies that ran them.

That's why corporations populated the world with mechanical products during the Industrial Age. They installed colossal production lines and supply chains that spread across the globe to maximize how much stuff we could make. This era of mass-production chipped away at "Main Street" economics by centralizing production inside a few companies. If you've ever watched business news, and their per second stock price changes, remorseless take-over bids, and vicious drive for profits, you've seen how hard it is for a big company to stay alive in the Industrial Age.

In short, in the era of mass-production companies live to compete.

Digital devices enable a new philosophy, one that fosters not a competition, but collaboration. Using computers and the internet to cooperate is our future. Because working online saves us from the redundant work of mechanical tools. For example, with Wikipedia, the world can use one website for its general knowledge, instead of reprinting, shipping, and buying millions of encyclopedia books every year.

In contrast to the Industrial Age's race to survive, the Internet Age has a competition to contribute.

Because, as discussed already, digital property never expires and can be accessed from anywhere.  With modern technology racing to mass-produce encyclopedias, lectures, or apps makes no sense. Instead, we can find topics with unwritten books, subjects with no Wikipedia page, problems with no apps, and contribute something new.

Because of digital property, humanity can contribute to a continuously updated repository of human knowledge, programs, and anything else you can design on a computer.

You can already see this new economy already forming. Several generations into the Internet Age, items like smartphones, laptops, and smartwatches are everywhere. That's why the collaboration websites like WikiHow, WhatsApp, and Quora integrate so easily into our lives.

Collaboration is today's big picture, the basic principle of the Internet Age's new philosophy. The people who understand this best are the open-source community.

## Open-Source Protagonists Are Pushing Us Into the Internet Age

Open-source is a growing community of inventors, designers, and programmers. They are the successors of the first computer protagonists. With honest hearts and genius minds, they're leading us all into the Internet Age. They live, breath, and promote collaboration at places like GitHub, Wikipedia, Dribbble, Udemy, Stack Overflow, and Discourse.

These modern-day Jedi have given Main Street the levers of power we need to upgrade ourselves to the Internet Age. Even if too many people don't realize it yet. Most of us still think things like retail stores, manufacturing, and education are industries only for Big Governments or Big Business to control. However, because of the open-source community, there are already countless new tools for ordinary people to take control of their work, identities, and lives.

Forget the bullshit jobs and eight different bosses. Cinderella can now stop praying her fairy godmother gets her past the palace gates because open-source has given everyone an invitation to the party of economic freedom.

Open-source heroes distribute our society's economic prosperity. Take a look, and you'll see it all around you.

Note the comedians producing their own podcasts. The parents who are educating their kids on Khan Academy. The moms learning how to repair iPads thanks to YouTube videos. The artists selling their products on Shopify websites. By distributing society's levers of power, open-source has turned many Industrial Age companies, products, and professionals into middlemen.

That's how the open-source community has super-charged Main Street. No longer are we bound to be extras in the Industrial Age, hoping for a better life. Now we can become player gods in the Internet Age, making a better life.

Open-source helped make me a player god (and later we'll see a protagonist too). I'm a politics, history, and philosophy geek who spends far too much time thinking about this stuff. Because of easy to use digital tools I can write, research, host my work. I can very easily find world-class writers and illustrators to add a professional touch. Heck, think of the connection between you and I. You're reading my ideas with no middlemen and for virtually free.

All because open-source heroes put new apps and electronics in both our hands.

The tech community calls this disruption. While disruption has thankfully torn down many gates. It mainly replaced low-hanging fruit like consumer goods. To keep ushering us into the Internet Age, we need to upgrade disruption with Techvolution. Only a society full of player gods will finally turn the fantastic world of science fiction into Main Street's new reality.

## Mass-Production Replaced by Mass-Collaboration Will Help Us Thrive

As a kid, I helped my family clean office buildings. My simple role was to pick up the garbage and recycling bins. Other than still hating the smell of old coffee, I really appreciate growing up doing honest work. Years later, when working at a big office, the cleaners were short-staffed for a few weeks. Management spent hours meeting about and discussing the "garbage problem" instead of just wrapping it up (pun intended) and moving on.

This delegation first mentality began when the steam engine powered the world's first production lines in the late 1700s. The clocklike movement of wheels, lathes, drills, and presses were mass-producing trains, clothes, and newspapers but still needed a lot of manpower. That's why throughout the 18th to 20th centuries, millions of farmers, craftsmen, and other specialists left their jobs to become factory workers.

Henceforth, most of Main Street worked huge machines. Coordinating every device, supply chain, and worker required many managers to be micro-managing task-masters. There was no other way to be sure all workers were organized to the strict rhythm of the production line. Mass-production is the reason one-sided jobs with rigid oversight became embedded in our social consciousness.

In early assembly lines, supervisors even inspected toilets to be sure workers weren't lying.

It sounds ridiculous, but it shows how vital coordination was. Workers were merely extensions of a great machine. Any kink in the chain was a delay in the assembly line that might cause the whole factory to stop. Look below, and you'll see how our factory working ancestors lived.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(76.67% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/ObedientNiftyBlackbear' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='70%' height='70%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p> <a href="https://gfycat.com/obedientniftyblackbear"></a></p>

<a href="https://gfycat.com/ifr/ObedientNiftyBlackbear" target="_blank" class="button small">Reader</a>

Today we don't work on the assembly line with bulky steam engines or massive presses. Much of industrial production is automated (or, sadly, outsourced). Most Westerners work in the [inside in hospitals, retail stores, or in an office](https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/employment-by-major-industry-sector.htm). And especially since personal computers, smartphones, and high-speed internet got so cheap and common, many workers don't need to work shoulder to shoulder any more.

Accordnig to the self-suffciency of Internet Age technology, workers can be more independent again.

Yet, we still value the micro-management of the production line. In fact, to earn a better living today usually means to "move up" and get a higher position inside management. Although they're sometimes gatekeepers, most of the "eight different bosses" are ordinary people looking to better feed their families.

It's time for our workplaces to modernize.

We start by no longer idolizing over-management. Then we must empower workers and customers to collaborate directly using digital technology. Just as the Industrial Age enabled mass-production, the Internet Age enables mass-collaboration.

Main Street is already starting to collaborate. For example, when we Google something, the advanced search engine isn't making up its own answer. Google is only helping us find solutions other people put on their own websites. Google is outstanding precisely because it connects two people; one with a question, the other with an answer.

What prevents this kind of collaboration and efficiency at work is the blind loyalty to the era of mass-production. Our culture of working preset hours of 9-5 from Monday to Friday is nothing but a holdover from working on a factory line in the Industrial Age.

Since few of us are handling machines anymore, we can work when and how it makes sense. We will, too, once we adopt Tecvholution.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/FavorableDamagedFirefly' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

_Digital technology automated much manufacturing and office work. But we've held onto the management culture of the era of mass-production. "Suffering" based employment will go away in the era of mass-collaboration. Credit: [Wisecrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Lngf3J8vN4)_

Being more free to work is normal. For example, before the Industrial Age, when you spoke with an innkeeper, taxi driver, blacksmith, there was nobody "above" them except perhaps the owner or master craftsman. Every worker had a skillset and was the controller of how to use it. These specialists were accountable to their customers, co-workers, and their sense of craft. It was only when industrialization gave the levers of power to factory owners, that our economy lost these small businesses.

Our work culture of "employees" and "management" didn't exist before the Industrial Age, and shouldn't after it's gone either.

That's why Airbnb gives innkeepers, Uber gives coach drivers, and Etsy gives artists back the levers of power and lets them have their own business again. The Internet Age will continue to distribute new apps, electronics, and the freedom to work to other specialists like programmers, underwriters, and contractors.

Returning individuals to the liberation of a distributed Main Street economy is how the "player god" of the Internet Age will get populated.

This change can't happen soon enough. Today there's an entire class of "eight different bosses" and BS jobs of consultants, administrators, managers, and executives. These professionals don't know the skills of their respective industries like nursing, engineering, and (definitely not) cleaning. Their power is simply to keep the Industrial Age mentality alive by creating, distributing, and monitoring things like regulations, manuals, and memos.

![old philosophy in a new world](https://techvolution.io/content/images/2020/04/GWRegStudies-PagesPublishedintheCFR-6.12.19.png)
_Federal government regulations. An example of all the rules our bureaucratic establishment makes._

For historical context, in 100 AD, the Roman Empire ruled over a third of the world's population. This era of "[Roman Peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Romana)" was a time of great prosperity not seen again until about 1700. Most outsiders dreamed about becoming Roman citizens.

And the Romans did all this with only several hundred state bureaucrats.

No kidding. Local communities, businesses, families mostly regulated their own lives with personal relationships. Not a direct comparison since our worlds are much different. But that should make you think. Meeting a Roman bureaucrat was like us meeting a physicist. They're out there when needed, but aren't relied upon up to live a daily life.

When given a chance, humanity is great at self-organizing and collaborating. The critical ingredient is clear goals, with accountability for everyone's contribution.

Picture it as a sports team. Since all members know they must win games, everyone is capable of assessing each other's contributions. A clear mandate lets administrators, trainers, coaches, captains, forwards, defenders, and goalies get evaluated by their impact. Collaboration is the freedom to work while being accountable for your contribution. And, it doesn't let coaches, administrators, or managers burden themselves with minute details.

After all, just like in _The Office_, many of our closet relationshps are at work. When people work together, we almost inevitably form close friendships and collaborate well, if only out of neccessity.

## Mass Collaboration Economics

With all this in mind, the mass-collaboration economy is already here and growing. It typically goes by the name share economy, crowd-sourcing, or Wikinomics. I call it the return of Main Street economics, and it's sweeping through our society.

In addition to popular apps like Airbnb and Etsy, there are countless examples of mass-collaboration in the open-source community alone. The community comes together to make a core technology. [Programmers help where their skills are best suited](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/). First-timers are often nervous, but soon feel a rush as they see their work improve a project. All together a single community makes a very good piece of software not possible if they acted in smaller groups.

The community then uses core technology to create their own specialized products.

>At its core, open-source is about collaboration. Whether it's version control, licenses, or issue trackers—everything exists to support people working with each other. Open source embodies a model for people to work together, building something greater than they can [create on their own](https://github.blog/2016-06-23-the-shape-of-open-source/).

For example, a large open-source community creates MediaWiki software. Then separate groups use MediaWiki to create Wikipedia, WikiHow, Fandom, and any other website you can think of. After all, MediaWiki is free for anyone to use; gatekeepers be damned! And this aspect of mass collaboration hasn't just been embraced by programmers. Mass-collaboration is how the Wikipedia community of writers, researchers, and editors wrote millions of articles in only a few years. It's also how Linux, Android, Chrome, and many other excellent services work too.

![old philosophy in a new world](https://techvolution.io/content/images/2020/04/open-source-projects.jpg)

_Some of the more famous open-source projects. Most of this software, worth many hundreds of billions, you can download and use for free. If you can't program, it only takes hiring a few to get whatever product you can imagine._

All this praise doesn't mean open-source communities are perfect and can run the world. It has problems. Mainly it's people can be too rude, and [it's too easy to free-load off its contributors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO8hZlgK5zc), discouraging growth.

That's why open-source is only a part of the ecosystem bringing the Internet Age and mass-collaboration to life. There will always be significant energy, manufacturing, and mining companies with large corporate structures, mass-producing our essential products. Likewise, the government will always run social programs and install traffic lights.

Within that in mind, however, open-source is vital.

Precisely because nobody owns its educational content, server software, operating systems, web apps, and so many other remarkable technologies. That means gatekeepers can't stop digital inventors from empowering more player gods. Whether it's with a simple rotating list of persons to take out the trash. An app that let us rent someone's spare bedroom. An online encyclopedia with millions of helpful articles. Or software to give society internet streaming—as when a few hackers tore down "Darth Blockbuster's" gate when he tried to keep us buying and borrowing his DVDs.

To continue opening gates, building the era of mass-collaboration, and ushering us into the Internet Age, the open-source community needs our support. We can't ask any more of them. The Jedi have done their job in endless writing, coding, designing, and fixing tools and technology we all depend on everyday.

Main Street needs to step up and flock to the open-source banner and grab hold of the tremondous levers of power they've made for us.

We can, once we become player gods.

_Figma is a design tool for websites and apps. In the past, designers, writers, programmers all spoke through many managers. With Figma, worker-to-worker collaboration becomes super-easy. Management is lessened because anyone can review progress in real-time. Your workplace can, and will, one-day foster cooperation like this. And it's the open-source software that lets us build it for ourselves.

## Fighting for The Future - The Era of Mass-Collaboration Won't Just Happen

Open-source lets Main Street make it's own content, apps, and electronics now. We can empower bakers and butchers over factory food owners. Tailors and sewists over sweatshops. Store owners and clerks over franchises. And, engineers and designers over executive bean-counters.

Empowering frontline specialists will usher in the era of mass-collaboration. It's a happier, more productive life with fewer bullshit jobs and layers of micro-managers.

You'll see a small example of mass-collaboration below.

_This is Louis Rossmann. He owns an electronics repair business. He's popular on YouTube because he teaches people how to repair electronics. When Louis needed a new store location, he got help online. Using online marketplaces, you can find work or hire online because the open-source community keeps tearing down gates._

## Open-Source Lets Us Build Levers of Power For Ourselves

Currently, when you phone a call center, everything is recorded. The company has access to the recording; you don't. Likewise, when the employee logs in and out of the office, that, too, is recorded. Management automatically has access to these timesheets; the employee doesn't.

Access to things like phone recordings and timesheets are levers of power because they control resources. Today management and corporations put "gates" around many of _our_ levers out of self-defense. Is there a good reason why customers can't confirm what was agreed to during their last phone call? Why can employees be grilled for a long lunch when the same manager quickly forgets unpaid overtime.

This lopsided balance of power allows customers and employees to be taken advantage of, encouraging mistrust, lackluster products, and inefficient workplaces. Uneven power makes mass-collaboration impossible.

The open-source community lets us fight back in three ways. First, it sets a great example because it entrusts everyone with all available information. Second, open-source wants more members, so the community loves to dismantle gates and distribute new tools to regular people. And third, since no one owns open-source technology, the people can empower ourselves with levers of power, only big institutions used to control. Such has call recordings and timesheets.

Distributing the levers of power moves us into the Internet Age. It treats people like adults and expects them to act like it. And if they don't, well, it's not like they can complain about mistreatment. With digital technology, all the actions and contributions are recorded. Once records are open and transparent, a disgruntled person has to reference facts instead of conjecture and emotion.

For example, I can't lie to you about starting this book in September 2019. It's all recorded by GitHub's "version control" system. Meaning, every day, I've uploaded the latest draft to a computer that timestamps everything. You can see all the versions if you want.

Open information makes lying to you, and myself, so much harder.

In my experience (and this is after processing 10,000 insurance claims), the vast majority of people just want to go on with their lives. It's only when they're misled, disadvantaged, and left in the dark that makes regular folk lash out. Open information, with easy-to-follow rules, is reasonable and thus gets the most out of people. Particularly because it makes cheating (on both sides) too hard to bother with.

People working well together is nothing new. Early America was blessed with communal barn-raising, quilting societies, and fraternal associations. They governed themselves in a Main Street economy. Open-source software and mass-collaboration simply adopt the same incentives. Because once our basic necessities are met, most people want to improve their craft, gain the respect of their peers, and pass-on their knowledge.

Open-source hero Linus Torvalds explained it by pointing out, "Money is not the greatest of motivators. Folks do their best work when they are driven by passion. When they are having fun. This is as true for playwrights and sculptors and entrepreneurs as it is for software engineers." Torvalds concludes, "What astonishes so many people is that the open-source model actually works."

With open-source, we have the technology to create our own levers of power to understand and enforce our warranty contracts, tax-laws, education systems, employment agreements, claim systems, and so on.

So, when the school board, doctor's office, the insurance company says, "fill in these forms," we should begin to say, "No, I want to use my open-source app. It let us both see timelines, appointments, and rules. If you don't want to use it, then I'll move my business. But if you do, I look forward to working with you."

Yes, it's perfectly okay for you to do that. It fact, it's your job as a player god.

_This is the [GitHub "repo" for Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails/graphs/contributors), the open-source technology that runs apps like Basecamp, Airbnb, and Shopify. Vist that page and you'll see all the thousands of people who've helped make the core technology even though most have never met each other. Mass-collaboration is this simple and effective. And, this priceless software required almost no garbage meetings. That's why you're job will one day soon use mass-collaboration to make something much greater than you're doing right now._

## Our Story — Launching Techvolution and Making Player Gods

The middle-class has to step up and upgrade our way of life to the Internet Age. We must fund, make, and grab hold of the levers of power the open-source community has created for us. Only then will we live in the era of mass-collaboration. If we don't, we'll keep suffering the pains of a degenerating society.

The biggest roadblock to the Internet Age is the gatekeeper Darth Blockbuster. The holdover from the Industrial Age and the antagonist of the modern era.

![old philosophy in a new world](https://techvolution.io/content/images/2020/04/suburbs-idealized.jpg)
_The American Dream, if you want to live in 1969 forever. There are lots of antagonists in this photo. Newspapers, broadcasters, oil, reporters, gas cars, k-university education are among today's largest Industrial Age holdovers._

Darth Blockbuster stalls the future by writing rules to keep his Industrial Age tools, and himself, in power. These rules are like a Death Star. They concentrate the legal departments, HR reps, corporate lobbyists of the Industrial Age to keep antagonists in control.

Before our civilization can evolve, we need to defeat Darth Blockbuster and blow up his super-weapon.

I'll explain the philosophy we need to win, but whether you decide to continue is up to you. If you're ready, keep reading. It's time to play the game and become a player god.

![old philosophy in a new world](https://techvolution.io/content/images/2020/04/main-street3.jpg)
_Lots of player gods have come before us. They did their job. Most recently, in the era of mass-production. Now it's our time to step up and evolve our civilization._

## Cast of Ideas and Characters

Before we become player gods, here are a few terms that will put us all on the same page:

**Player god**: Imagine a person playing a computer "civilization building" game with our society. They would hold all the levers of power and thus decide where to put roads, what food to grow, and when houses get solar panels. Of course, there is no such deity. In reality, it's the choices of individuals that decide what the community does. We choose to emit too much CO2, eat healthy good, or use an InstaHealth medical app. It's only when a person uses tools and appreciates the importance of their actions, do they become player gods who "play the game" of civilization.

**Philosophy**: The largely unspoken ideals that tell individuals what's right and wrong, good and bad, in science, art, morals, politics, and economics. Philosophy is created inside books, declarations, and constitutions to unite individuals to see the big picture, that everyone's choices matter because everyone is a player god. Note, _the player god_ is a community of people playing the game together because they're united by the same "ruling" philosophy.

**Ruling philosophy**: A civilization's chosen philosophy. One that "clicks" for all factions and ideologies. Examples include the "Divine Rights of Kings," derived from Christian theology and used in royalist Europe; "Marxist-Leninism" of the Soviet Union; and the combination of "Right/Left" philosophies of the Western world today. The ruling philosophy is supposed to help society evolve and win the game of civilization.

**Happiness**: The test of how well the ruling philosophy is doing its job. Spending quality time with family, having good friends, improving one's skill set are signs of genuine happiness.

**Rulebook**: The written and unwritten social, professional, and legal rules that govern everyday life. People write the rulebook by interpreting the ruling philosophy. Some examples are building by-laws, workplace seniority rules, and defining who can get married.

**Technology**: A catchall term for things we make tools from, like concrete, lumber, nails, shingles, insulation, and bricks.

**Tool**: A catchall term for things we create with technology to solve a problem, like guns to kill bad guys, books to record and pass on knowledge, and houses to shelter in. We use tools to evolve.

**Levers of Power**: The most powerful tools; the ones that control society. In Civilization games, these are the buttons, toggles, and sliders players control. In reality, levers of power are the tools that power, educate, inform, feed, and transport resources in our society. The more levers a person controls, the more self-sufficient they are, which gives them the freedom to become a player god.

**Frontline**: The point of contact between a tool and the problem. Nurses giving vaccines, cleaners cleaning a city bus, and soldiers on the battlefield are all examples of frontline settings. People on the frontline work jobs that solve specific problems with a proven skillset. Frontline workers physically hold the levers of power but don't always control them. They will, once the era of mass-collaboration starts.

**Hierarchy**: A power structure that manages every lever of power's use by society. Kings and queens with the keys to the castle, or the corporate ladder at Blockbuster controlling DVD rentals, are examples of past hierarchies. As hierarchies grow, they get more detached from the frontline and start forming gates to protect their tool losing its importance. People in the regime give themselves titles like prince and executive, baron and supervisor to mark their position—and, in a sense, their territory and "rights" in the power structure.

**The Game of Civilization**: The invention of new technology and cultures to overcome frontline problems. Civilization develops in ages. As we evolve, we create new levers of power. When society adopts a modern philosophy, it transforms the hierarchies of the prior era.

**Culture**: The accepted way of lifes in a society. Getting information updates from newspapers and broadcast TV, watching professional sports, working 9-5, Monday to Friday, are all parts of the Industrial Age culture many people today still assume is natural because it's the culture we grew up with. Culture changes when protagonists introduce new levers of power into society.

**Protagonists**: People who invent, spread, and use new technology for the greater good. Usually close to the problems on the frontline, they individually struggle. Still, their continued self-sacrifice slowly improves life on Earth. I call them this world's Jedi knights or Hogwarts students. We call their leaders trailblazers who relish skirting the rules. Galileo, Michael Faraday, Nikola Tesla, Jay Last, Grace Hopper, Michael S. Hart, Dennis Ritchie, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Linus Torvalds, Gabriel Weinberg, Salman Khan, Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk are among their number.

**Antagonists**: People who selfishly defend their wealth, power, and prestige atop a hierarchy. Antagonists manage companies or institutions based on dated technologies and think that working on the frontline is beneath them. They work to control society's rulebook, so they can prevent protagonists' new tools becoming new levers of power. We don't often individually identify them. I coined the term "Darth Blockbuster" so we can.

**Extras**: Everybody in the middle of a battle between antagonists and protagonists. Because they're unattached to either side, extras can pick winners and losers. Sadly, extras don't realize their power and often refuse to even accept they're living inside a game of civilization. When they do, they become player gods. If they don't, the game of civilization turns into a story they merely watch.

**The Death Star**: The rulebook when it's controlled by Darth Blockbuster. Today it exists inside many regulations, agreements, manuals, contracts, and laws that prevent new levers of power from reaching Main Street. The Death Star is currently busy trying to keep the Industrial Age alive.

**Antagonism**: The impulse to reject new technology out of fear that change will disadvantage one's position. Antagonism is Darth Blockbuser's official ideology. It's told to Main Street inside the terminology and beliefs of an old ruling philosophy. For example, the (supposed) noble bloodlines of European royalty justifying their unelected leaders because the Holy Bible (supposedly) said they were divine. Today, antagonism is Main Street's biggest obstacle.

**Techvolution**: A new philosophy empowering seamless human technological evolution by ridding Darth Blockbuster of his power, by giving player gods the right and duty to decide when society should upgrade our culture and tools.

**The Life Star**: A rulebook based on Techvolution that's governed by human technological adaption and natural selection. The Lift Star makes sure humanity never again lets antagonism stall our upgrade to the next technological age.

**Plot**: Getting todays extras to step up, grab hold of open-sources new digital levers of power, and become player gods who replace their ruling philosophy with Techvolution and thereby establish the era of mass-collaboration inside the Internet Age.

This is what America, Canada, Britain, and much of the world looked like in the 1800s. A time of mud roads, hand tools, and abacus calculators. Human perseverance and ingenuity filled in for limited technology. Being hungry and sick, cold, and tired was an all too common way of life back then. These people dreamed of owning some land and having the tools to work it. Or later on, ordinary people dreamed of getting a job in a factory and renting an apartment in the city.

This video is important to see. Left/Right aren't evil ideologies. Both were designed to turn nothing into something. Their writers like Adam Smith, Edmund Burke, and John Stuart Mill also never had running water, listened to the radio, made a phone call, opened a fridge, took penicillin, started a motor, typed on a keyboard, or learned about evolution.

Their philosophy was designed to upgrade society so everyone in the world would get better tools, and thus a better life.

However, today, we live inside the world the Industrial Age dreamed of making. Yet by keeping Left and Right as our ruling philosophy, our rulebook is still focused on promoting the industrialization of society even though were generations into the Internet Age.

Happily, we've already been evolving ourselves into the modern era.

That's the reason we're so addicted to new technology. Checking news feeds, flying drones, taking endless photos, playing hours of computer games are acts of extras mastering the tools of player gods. Our ancestors did the same. They read many printed books, used scientific instruments, worked the land with metal tools, and owned muskets. At first, these were merely addictive toys until new philosophies turned them into the lightsabers that finally brought down the nobility of the Medieval Age.

When regular people could read unknown history, see the Universe for themselves, work their own land, and revolt against royalty, the game was won.

Our addicting toys are also new levers of power. They're so powerful, we can use these proverbial lightsabers to earn a happier life. We will, once we stop chasing Left/Right phantoms, adopt Techvolution, and buy our own levers of power. Only then will we defeat antagonism and upgrade to the Internet Age.

_If you had the choice a person marching against climate change, ranting about high energy costs, or a person upgrading their windows, who would you rather pick to play your game of civilization?_
