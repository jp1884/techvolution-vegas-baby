# Prologue

Hush-A-Phone v. United States, 238 F.2d 266 (D.C. Cir. 1956) was a seminal ruling in [[United States]] [[telecommunications]] decided by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals]]. [[Hush-A-Phone|Hush-A-Phone Corporation]] marketed a small, cup-like device that mounted on the speaking party's microphone. The attachment reduced the risk of conversations being overheard and increased sound fidelity for the listening party. At the time, [[American Telephone & Telegraph|AT&T]] had a near-monopoly on America's phone system, even controling the equipment attached to its network. In this era, Americans had to lease equipment from Ma Bell, or use pre-approved devices. Hush-A-Phone had been around for 20 years without any issues. However, when an AT&T lawyer saw one in a store window, the company decided to sue on the grounds anything attached to a phone could damage its network<ref>{{cite book|title=The Innovators|last=Isaacson|first=Walter|date=2014|publisher=Simon & Schuster|page=387}}</ref>.

AT&T, citing the [[Communications Act of 1934]], which stated in part that the company had the right to make changes and dictate "the classifications, practices, and regulations affecting such charges," claimed the right to "forbid attachment to the telephone of any device 'not furnished by the telephone company.{{'"}}

Initially, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) ruled in AT&T's favor. It found that the device was a "foreign attachment" subject to AT&T control and that unrestricted use of the device could, in the commission's opinion, result in a general deterioration of the quality of telephone service.<ref>"Phone Company Upheld in Ban on Hush-A-Phone," ''The New York Times,'' February 17, 1951, p. 29</ref>

== Finding ==

A federal appeals court dismissed AT&T's claim. The court's decision stated that AT&T's prohibition of the device was not "just, fair, and reasonable," as required under the Communications Act of 1934. Per the judgment, the device "does not physically impair any of the facilities of the telephone companies," nor did it "affect more than the conversation of the user."  The court thus exonerated Hush-A-Phone and prohibited further interference by AT&T toward Hush-A-Phone users.

This victory for Hush-A-Phone was widely considered a watershed moment in the development of a secondary market for [[terminal equipment]]. In addition it contributed to [[breakup of the Bell System]]. It was still illegal to connect some equipment to the AT&T phone network. For example, modems could not electronically connect to the phone network. Instead, users were forced to connect their modems mechanically by attaching a phone receiver to an acoustic coupler via suction cups<ref>{{cite book|title=The Innovators|last=Isaacson|first=Walter|date=2014|publisher=Simon & Schuster|page=387}}</ref>.

Regardless, after the Hush-A-Phone case, further barriers to using AT&T's phone network began to crumble. This landmark decision, and the related [[Carterfone]] decision, were seen as precursors to the entry of [[MCI Communications]] and the development of more pervasive telecom competition. This was perhaps best seen in 1981 when the purely electronic [[Hayes Microcomputer Products|Hayes modem]] electronically connected home computers to the internet for the first time<ref>{{cite book|title=The Innovators|last=Isaacson|first=Walter|date=2014|publisher=Simon & Schuster|page=387}}</ref>.
