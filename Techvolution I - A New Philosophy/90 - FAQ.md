## Wishful Thinking

This ended sooner than I thought, so why not take some time to fill any holes. Let's have a conversation and flesh out the ideas inside Techvolution a little.

 - A comdedy stage is a fission in the matrix, a place where no ruling philosophies lives.

Maybe a Rogan interview? Why not.

ROGAN
And we're live. Hey, the magic man!

MAJIC
In the flesh. Or so you think right. Insert whatever joke you want.

ROGAN
So you're name is really magic? And you have yourself the name of human evolution.

MAJIC
If it catches.

ROGAN
It fits... would be weird if it catches.

MAJIC
What's it like being so popular just for being reasonable and curious.

ROGAN
Insane.

MAJIC
Same thing I guess. There's so many pretenders. Darth Newsbroadcasters using dark majic to keep people away from new tools.

ROGAN
Explain that for people who don't know what you're talking about.

DEAD AIR

ROGAN
Hey, what are you nodding off.... Jamie what the fuck?

MAJIC
That's what it's like having a stutter. It's like using telephone with a broken speaker. Our tools aren't toys, they're extensions of us.

Every lifeform has life, a will to live. It's how many tools a lifeform has, that defines if it can swim, survive in cold or heat, retain water, or whatever. The more self-sufficient, the better the lifeform can survive. We do the same thing by evolving and inventing new tools.

ROGAN
What you call majic. The act of attraction to new tools. Like...

MAJIC
You picking up a microphone, standing on a stage, with people having drinks waiting for you to say something. You probably feel at home there.

ROGAN
Yeah of course.

MAJIC
Right there, you're a different cyborg, a different species, inside an ecosystem then you are right now, or that I've ever been. We don't really understand that, or even think about it. We'd never ask what's your cyborgolgy on a medical form. We should.

ROGAN
I can't pick up this pen, keyboard, knife...

MAJIC
You can pick it up, but only when you're attached to it is it majic, like comedians and microphones inside night clubs. And once you learn what tools people are attached to, you'll learn their true politics, like there's little chance a comedien isn't a free speech supporter. Political parties, bumper stickers, means shit.

ROGAN
Like limosine liberals and conservatives who dodged the draft.

MAJIC
Yeah, understanding someone's tools, their house, their method of transportation, and especially what funds their lifestyle tells you their politics.

ROGAN
I'm almost left wing on every issue.

MAJIC
That's bullshit

ROGAN
Why?

MAJIC
Do you shot guns, you do drive gas cars, do you do BJJ, do you fly around for comedy? Have a family...

ROGAN
Yes

MAJIC
Then that's your politics. Not self-description, your actions define your politics. I read this book by David Mamet back in school.

ROGAN
I want to know what University of Toronto was like...

MAJIC
Sure, but this book, On Directing Film. It teaches the craft of storytelling, and Mamet end's up ranting against performance artists who high-jack stories to tell rant about themselves.

For example, while introverted hacks describe characters as "being a weird guy with a flair for the unusual" true storytellers say "a guy walking into a whorehouse and asking the matron what five bucks will get him".

ROGAN
So...

MAJIC
So the same thing applies to us. Telling me your politics is like a screenwriting telling me about a guy's "flair for the unusual". It means nothing. What a person does in society, how's he get to work, does he treat employees like shit, did he invest in credit default swaps, what he actually does defines his political support.

If you want ot change your politics, use different toolsM. Changing your cyborgolgy is stronger than voting. Like Frederick Douglass. Him reading and speaking change things much then just casting a vote.

ROGAN
So whose Darth Blockbuster? I get this sense you're a guy, a regular guy...

MAJIC
Good looking regular guy

ROGAN
What, not really but I'll give it you...

MAJIC
For the audio only crowd...

ROGAN
For sure. Darth Blockbuster?

MAJIC
The original one is incompetent, but had a kid whose mother yelled at any teacher who didn't give her special little guy a good grade. But the University of Toronto. If academia is your thing it's a good school. But it's devoted to its aged cyborgology, like DB is.

If you'd invent a new education sytem you'd never base it around lecture halls, libraries, and term papers that are read once and thrown away. But what are they going to do, close down? Like a chiropractor college, that's all they know. Even for a person, if a comedic is getting paid, it's probably harder to try something new.

ROGAN
You're better off...

MAJIC
If you're a risk taker. Darth Blockbuster isn't. Instead  He tries to keep new tools away. Literally making it illegal. Or if that fails, attacking it with sneers, exclusion. Like any antagonist, he doesn't realize he's doing this. He hides the truth from himself by being self-important, and then distracts his customers with spectacle.

That's why universities put on such a show of "graduation" even though most student's know its bullshit. Or the Oscars, whose movies almost no one watches anymore, making an award show purely about the red carpet, not the content.

ROGAN
That's what you mean by Darth Majic. Tricking customers to keep themselves attached to an old tool instead of upgrading their cyborgology. Dark majicians push old products everywhere. From Spider-Man 10, to the new and super improved shampoo, to the new Jeep Wrangle.

MAJIC
You got it.

ROGAN
It's bullshit. The UFC had to fight like crazy against these rules.

MAJIC
Fuck I didn't, I forgot, no kidding yeah, you'd be an expert at this...

ROGAN
Yeah, it was every state, every company, every advertiser. When I read about the Death Star of rules, that's what I thought of immediately.

MAJIC
Shit, I with I used that as a reference. I didn't even think of it. Next time. And there was no talking to them.

ROGAN
None.

MAJIC
Because you were talking to a different species. Someone with a different cyborgology who is defending themselves. The ecosystem only has so many spots. We can't see that yet because people look the same we can't see cyborgology, yet it causes so many of our political fights. Once we can, our politics will smooth out a lot.

ROGAN
You ever read any books, like what's your favorite.

MAJIC
Why the Allies Won by Richard Overy is up there.

ROGAN
Why's that?

MAJIC
You'd like it. World War II wasn't a sure victory. Overy explains how making and improvng more and better tools let the Allies last long enough to turn the tide. The Nazi's were all about racial bullshit and making superweapons, the Japanese barely had any research and development. But the allies simply made their tools better. No matter the person holding it, a way better tool makes a better cyborg.

If I made a contribution to learning, is to interpret human events through the creation and fight over tools. IT's a more accurate why to understand and predict politics. I'll go more into it later on though. And The Generals, you'd like that book.

ROGAN
Is that about the American general staff, I've heard of it.

MAJIC
Yeah it explains in World War II, America had a small military, custom built with the latest tools and techniques, with a clear mission, thus it could rotate generals in and out based on their performance on the battlefield. In later wars, generals were career men, and being replaced caused bad office politics. Results on the battlefield got worse.

That's what an established heirarchy gets you. In WWII, there was few people out to protect their own future. A standing army, or corporation, or whatever, means people only look up, and don't have a reason to care about the frontline.

Jamie, pop up a picture of Charles Martel. See that man. Fucking guy was a swordmaster military man. Now look up Louis XIV. He's wearing makeup and a dress. That's what a standing heirarchy gets you.

ROGAN
What do you think's going to happen with the red/blue politics as you say.

MAJIC
Nothing good. America's been building the 1969 lifestyle for fifty years. All those suburban homes, highways, car per person, every kid going to super expensive education.

Progressives, their job in the industrial revolution's creation of tools was bringing new people in work at the coal mines, smelting plants, auto factories, then keep them happy with some social reforms.

Conservatives job was to make them sign on the dotted line and majically merge with primitive tools to keep the factories busy.

ROGAN
That's it. That simple.

MAJIC
It's like a kimura, there's lots of work that went into designing it, but the average person only needs to know the finished product. Upon reflection, that's what red and blue's contribution was.

ROGAN
Do you really belief tech companies should get adversarial.

MAJIC
Yes. Darth Boxing or whoever was working against the UFC refused to even hear you out. They did that because why would the smaller cat promote fucking lions coming into their ecosystem.

Likewise, if the lion wants in, they have to just go in and let the old lifeform adapt or die off. Either we transport using telecommunications, Uber's, bikes, walking, whatever, or we're inside a 1969 private passenger automobile sitting in traffic. A person literally can't be in two places at the same time.

New tech shouldn't try to fit in, but transform the ecosystem, otherwise you're just visiting. And when someone says that's wrong, just say check out Techvolution mother fucker.

Wait, you'd know this shit more than I do, or could really/

ROGAN
What do you mean?

MAJIC
Comedy's got to be similar. You enter into a person's psyche and play around.

ROGAN
Yeah.

MAJIC
I'd like to do that, like a Black Mirror series but Techvolution. Showing people the world they could have if we could make them laugh at red/blue politics.

ROGAN
You really hate them.

MAJIC
Wouldn't you if they said comedy is against the rules.

ROGAN
They're trying.

MAJIC
You know why. Because after 1969 we should have been starting to build The Jetson's, but Darth Blockbuster spent all his time protesting and marching and doing arts and crafts instead of learning engineering and how to build new things. When he took over from his parents, all he knew was talk, complaining and living it's 1969.

ROGAN
Red and blue aren't different.

MAJIC
Only to each other. They agree on cars, single detached houses, universities, televised debates with 2 minute speaking times. They both watch The Simpson's and think it's the future.

That's why they exported American manufacturing. Because China was and endless Simpson's episode. No new tools to design, build, or market. Just press repeat and watch the money come to fund the banquets and balls. Just don't hold any parties in Detroit or Cleveland.

ROGAN
What can they do?

MAJIC
See politics as the control over tools. Darth Gas Car couldn't make a Tesla car, they spread dark majic that electric cars are unAmerican. That the roar of an engine is cool or whatever. Meaning the average family just needs to get from A to B.

It's really sad actually. Imagine Darth Kings forebears were among the great warriors in history. Darth Blockbuster's were among the most industrious, guys who ruled the world from sea to sea on the creation of railways and shipyards. Now... not so much.

You could read Darth Blockbuster as being the end of the line in the The Decline and fall of the British Empire. But that's a heck of a thing to say.

ROGAN
Now what?

MAJIC
Shame. They are bad. They are wrong. They are a they. Using old philosophies we fight racists and socialists and other idiots. Yet I'd bet ...., the protagonists, the ones who promote new tools like podcasts, electric cars, solar power, online education, new tools that are better they're more efficient.

They have to see us and fight for their place in a new and better ecosystem. I hope I've helped them tell each other, the anatgoinsts, and the extras why they're the good guys who need their support.

Think, Musk, Jobs, Gates, these guys in many ways got lucky. Imagine how many others are out there. Imagine our world if a YouTube channel teaching actual engineering didn't have to survive on ad clicks. While univeristies get $25,000 per a student, per a year.

Those numbers should be flipped.

ROGAN
Anything else.

MAJIC
I hate how they limit people's potential. That a kid whose good at tinkering with stuff, or who loves to write, or like repairing bikes, is told they have to go live the 1969 American Dream just so Darth can party on on their morgage payment, university payments, credit card debt, and so on.

I think most people are so ready and waiting to form millions of new kinds of cyborgs, inside an ecosystme where everyone has to reciprocate to earn their place in the story of life.

ROGAN
Let's end it with that.

MAJIC
Cheers.
