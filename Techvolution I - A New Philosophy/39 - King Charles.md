## Place in line

When Rousseau wrote his power to the extas, anti-rule book philosophy, King Louis XVI rule France, King George III ruled England. Both faced revolutions inspired by their mismanagement of government, its finances, and also Rousseau's dialogue. However, these weren't the first kings to face revolts.

Before Rousseau inspired revolutions, the people still rose up against noble's excesses and incompetent leadership. Without Rousseau's philosophy, they had to use Christian theology to do it. Among the first to face the wrath was King Charles I who ruled 1625-1649.

Charles I ruled as an absolute monarch. England did have a Parliament but it had nomial powers, serving "at the will of the King". It was supposed to advise the king, not tell him what to do. After some revolts, parliament did however earn the power to approve taxes.

After years of mismanaging government finances, Charles needed money. Parliament refused to say yes, until it got more powers. Charles refused to talk and instead sent parliament home for 10 years. He raised taxes using some very old feudal customs.

Parliament eventually got sick of this subversion, and fought the English Civil War from 1642–1646. Parliamentarians, mostly Puritans and Presbyterians, and Loyalists tore England apart. Charles' side lost. He was held under arrest, while rules for a "constituional monarcy" were being made by the Parliamentarians. Charles escape, and fought another civil war from 1648–1649. One noted writer called described England as a society with no government, where life was "nasty, brutish, and short".

After the second civil war, the Parliamentarisn didn't want a monarchy at all, and put Charles on trial for crimes against the English people. Quite a novel idea at the time. But because the people read books, held muskets they were empowered, even if they didn't have Rousseau's philosophy yet to exactly explain why they were indeed equal to the supposed nobles.

Charles didn't care. He was the descedant of 1,000 years of noble blood. He was the natural leader the same way a father is the leader of his children. This paternalism is literally the philosopical basis of the divine rights of the nobles. When Charles was on trial for his life, he refused to speak to the court. A father doesn't answer to his children.

But then Charles did speak, and that fact, showcases how set the Sith are in their stories.

## Charles Speaks

Charles had a speech impediment. Often called a stammer or studder. No one then, or even now, understands what causes it. It's like a gremlin holding an electrical cord connecting your thoughts and your tongue; sometimes the electricity flows, and sometimes it doesn't. In practice this means some words are easy to say, some are ~~difficult~~ hard, and some decide which at the last mili-mili-mili-second.

Talking with a stutter is like playing guitar, except the music notes are written on the fly by a gremlin. Every sentence is a stream of sayable, non sayable, and maybe sayable words. The stutterer has to jump around the notes in real time. Fail and you stutter. It's not just a word. A stutter is like getting hit with a stun gun. You're body seizes. Your neck tenses. You stop breathing. It's horrible.

The physical pain isn't the worst. Getting  _that_ look from people is. The "what the fuck is wrong with you?" look. However, when you jump around the notes fast enough, people hear the wonderful music of smooth talking. And it's wonderful!

Hello, my ~~name~~ I go by John-ne. I wa-want ~~can~~ want to help ~~master~~ human evol-ution. I've been ~~writ~~ trying to write this book for ~~about~~ ah ~~five~~ six months...

The prospect of talking, except to yourself and a dog, which Charles had two of, causes huge anxiety. _The King's Speech_ showed it well. Stuttering usually forces a person to be shy, passive, eager to please, and come up with weired reasons for their erratic speaking like hand gestures, random silence, drinking, and swear words (which for some reason never cause a stutter). It's entirely possible King Charles' relationship with Parliament was so bad because he simply didn't want to talk with them. Not that he would ever admit he had a problem. After all, he was a king!

I know this all because luckily enough (kidding) I have the same affliction as King Charles. It was the reason I got a job in a car insurance claim department. After a vice president at an old company secretly told my supervisor I wasn't allowed to talk to customers, for fear of embarrasing the company, I was like shit I guess I don't have this damn gremlin under control. I wasn't even that mad about it (although I was that they lied about it for over a year). I never told anyone I had the impediment, so despite therapy as a kid, it was obviously still a problem.

So fuck it. I decided to jump into to the deep end and sink or swim. A car insurance claim call-centre is like the Olympic trials for a stutterer. So I jumped in and had a daily workout of all day phone calls, huge emotional outbursts from customers, customer service expectations, no "outs" like swear words, booze, or wonky behavior to hide behind.

And it was far worse then I thought. The insurance company wanted adjusters to answer ever more phone calls. To incentize us, they'd ring a monotone digital "bell" because... I don't know, to de-sensitize us to customers, or to make us hurry up. Management used it as punishment; "answer more phone calls or we'll make the bell faster and louder!". The amount of car accidents didn't matter. When snow storms made accidents spike, we were supposed to answers calls faster in the same proportion.

I'm being serious by the way. We were often more stressed then the person who just had a car crash. Whatever the reason, DING-DING-DING-DING all day, which gave people who weren't stutterers huge anxiety, breakdowns, sick leaves; one guy had a frickin heart attack. Many days were like the stock market crashed. Some calls were actually nice, but most the time you and the caller just wanted to hurry up and go about your day.

Super-shock speech therapy! After about a year I didn't have to massage my jaws at night to release it from all the teeth shattering jaw-clenches I did to divert vocal stuttering. I was cured!

The point is this. That's what I took for me to mostly now, never really stutter (except for situations where pretenious cultures limit my word options). It's like night and day. A hidden outgoing personality was brought out and frankly is fun, although still surreal, to be.

Yet Charles never had this lesson. He was famoulsy shy, quiet, and anxious his whole life because that's the personality the gremlin imposes on you. Even when fighting a 10 year war defending his "noble right" to govern England, Charles still probably had to massage his strained jaws every night. I can sympathize. The gremlin is a bully.

At Charles trial, he was accused of being "a Tyrant, A Traitor, Murderer, and a public enemy to the Commonwealth of England". The prosecutors said Charles didn't have a "divine right to rule" and asked for the death penalty. Charles wouldn't even acknowledge the charges, the trial, or his judges. His life was on an actual chopping block, and he just ignored the possibility of being guilty of anything.

Charles wasn't pretending or bluffing. He wasn't proud, or stubborn. He psychologically couldn't understand even the idea of being wrong. He lived in a different story. One that made him the protagonist for life because he was a noble. Noble's rule. God said so. Who is anyone to question God?

The judges convicted Charles anyway. He was sentenced to death by removing the head from the body. Charles was flabbergasted, and finally spoke in his defense. Fuck the ringing bell of a claims department, Charles only had words to save his life! Speak or die Charles. And... and... no stutter. Not once!

Charles freely, openely, spoke the music of his mind.

He didn't just speak, he spoke so eloquently many people, even those who hated him, were impressed. He spoke so well, so clearly, people heard no gremlin! Fuck... I'm happy for him. It must have felt like so much vindication. Like having lunch with your dream girl after years of thinking you could never ask her out. Charles must have thought God killed the gremlin for him. Indeed Charles's last words were a clearly spoken "I am the Martyr of the people."

Charles spoke clearly because he had no anxiety. He had no doubts. No questions. He was wrong, dead wrong. Pun intended. His and his peers ignorance caused so much destruction we've been studying it for centuries. Yet he still believed he was making society better. He died believing in it while speaking his last words without a hint of a stutter.

I can tell you how hard that was for him. Although I'd ~~still~~ have to jump a-around, ~~this~~ the ~~smaller~~ gremlin while I did. It's rare to be so, it's rare to be so con--fid happy, that the gremlin ~~runs~~ goes gone for good.

This story may seem dramatic. It's not. I'm using King Charles because he was among the first nobles to have the choice of leaving the throne. King George III of England had the same choice in 1776 when American coloials wanted representation inside their government. King Louis XVI of France had a similar choice in 1789 and choose to stay. He ironically helped design the guiliotine that would cut his head off. Tsar Nicholas II of Russia in 1917 had a similar choice. He left the throne, but not before bringing anarchy to Tsarist Russia that brought the communists to power who soon killed him and his family.

The nobles divine right to rule was a ruling philosophy. The ruling philosophy was wrong. IT was behind the technological times. We shouldn't wait for ours to cause civil wars and revolutions before thinking about making some changes.

I guess the best way to do that, is show you a better reality than just following the rules. So to replace the Death Star, here's the better reality made by Techvolution, as seen by the Life Star.
