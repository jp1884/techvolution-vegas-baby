# LIFE STAR

Have to integrate the next several chapters into a Life Star sequence, and use these topics as filters, toggles, moons of Jupiter, to showcase a ruling philosophy that, like a physicist and biologist does today, uses science to find the truth, not personal opinions absent of better sensory input like telescopes, microscopes and such...

- There's something about Life Star, and Sun, and knowledge, telling us the age/rules. The Sun tell us our age in revolutions, but Life Star tells us our scientific age.
- Notably, once Techvolution frees people to choose their own tools, it's the majic of millions of people, that builds our Life Star.
- Life Star is technological representation of nature. Like an ecosystem, it enforces accountability and reciprocation between lifeforms and thereby the Techvolution of life.
- red / blue, start seeing individuals as contractors, going through life, not 9-5 people who need to and from work and find something to do on the weekends.
- and civilization story gets a big upgrade.  We need to change our ruling philosophy to take advantage of digital tools. Only you can make it happen. That doesn't mean we replace red/blue, it means we disable the Sith from every coming back.
- People will never stop following the rules. Anarchy doesn't work. The key to victory is changing the source of the rule book, from human rules, to Nature's. Just like science did.
- the way to fight back against human rules/philosophies, is not to have a philosphical argugment of "better", simply track resources like in Nature. ex. how many laptops are totally replaced, rather then repaired, because repairability is so hard. and factor in this number/cost when buying/insuring the tool.
- Rossman, think of neighbors as my source of help, not my source of competition. we have to know each other's "business" to have each other's back. Fight back with Life Star knowledge is power, not only regulation battles.
- With Techvolution, you won’t fight political battles with bristol boards or painted faces. You’ll economically exercise your right to vote, by deciding which tools best solve your problem at home, work, and play. Unlike me, you’ll never need to deal with any gatekeepers, because you won’t have to knock at anyone’s door asking permission to do what’s best for you. Only nature's rules will end the gatekeepers.

## Fish Eyes

How did life evolve eyes. It's not like one day a lifeform woke up and had 20/20 vision. Adaptions are gradual. The first eyes were cells in a bacteria that simply said light and dark. But this new tool let these bateria cells probe the environment and sense day and night, and up and down. It worked wonders in the story of life because they found resources better. It's why most lifeforms today have eyes.

Tools increase our senses. Fast forward hundreds of millions of years, humanity had excellent 20/20 vision. We could sense colors, distance, and depth. It's not like these things weren't always there. Life just couldn't sense them before.

Yet our excellent eyes could only see so far. Looking at the brilliant universe, our minds wanted to make sense of the colors, lights, and revolution of the sky. Myths abounded about running foxes, warring giants, and fireflies struck up there. The biggest question was the simplest. Are we moving, or is the Universe? Our eyes couldn't tell.

Ancient Greek's had two big ideas. Aristotle said the Earth stood still. If it moved, why don't stars in the sky change position. Aristarchus said the Sun is way bigger than the Earth, surely we must revolve around it, and the stars don't-look like-they move because they're extremely far away.

The best minds in the world choose the wrong answer. From Aristotle in 300 BC, to Issac Newton in 1600. The Sun revolved around the Earth. They believed it so much they said the Holy Bible even agreed. People used Plotemy's "epicycles" to explain the planet's movements and make navigation and weather pattern charts. They worked well enough, but since the premise was wrong they had to change the math every once and a while.

When Copernicus rediscovered Artistarchus, he thought maybe if the Earth revolved around the Sun, the math would make more sense. He tried it, and it did, although he kept assuming planets move in perfect circles so it wasn't perfect. He was scared, so only publised his work on his deathbed. The powers that be didn't like questioning a huge pilar of science, religious, and political mythology. When Friar Bruno (your name sake) went from city to city proclaiming the Earth moved, the Universe had many worlds, and lots of other stuff, Darth Geocentric burned him alive. Let the others be warned.

Then Galileo made his telescope. It was a primitive telescope with hazy lenses made from hazy glass, but magnified our excellent 20/20 vision. We were no longer primitive lifeforms with insufficient senses. Instead of merely telling the difference between up and down, day or night; we could now tell the difference between moving and not moving.

Many Sith lords tried to stop the new truth of new tools with a mountain of rules. Yet the people majically bonded anyway. They probed the environment and sensed the many errors inside the ruling philosophy, mainly the "nobles right to rule", that was enforced to keep the art loving and spectacle making, heirarchy alive. The classic story of tools solving real life problems won out like always.

With no tools like the telecope, microscope, spectro, and other scientific instruments, any and all human made rule books to explain the Universe in physics, biology, chemistry, botany fell down. With enough senses, even basic ones, was enough to probe the rule book called Nature.

Before digital tools, we may have had bacteria eyes to indicate light and dark, but we had no telescopes to probe for clear economic and political answers. We did our best with human made rule books and learned by trial and error in the dark. We searched for visions of the just and good society and did very well finding it at times with strong human virtues, but most of our battles was against Darth Blockbuster, not against Nature.

Digital tools are to politics and economics, what the telescope was to astronomy and physics. The Life Star isn't about bringing any heirarchies down, it's about bringing the frontline out of the dark. I can show you what I mean by asking you a question. How old are you?

- Evolution empowers life by giving every new lifeform a slightly different variation. With variations life can constantly test for environmental changes in things like water levels, temperature, and food supply. The variations unfit for the frontline die off. The fittest survive. This natural selection is how evolution finds which lifeforms best represent life on Earth.

## What Happens Next

That damn Obi-Wan. He probably turned into a ghost like in the movie and went on vacation or wherever. But no worries. For I am Skywalker, destined to save the galaxy and bring the Force to human evolution. So here we go. Let's build the Life Star.

We don't know exactly what it is. Yet we have a great starting point. It's opposite. Light is the opposite of dark the same way full is the opposite of empty. Knowing one, defines the other. The Death Star is a rule book written humans. The Life Star is the opposite of the Death Star.

So what is it? The Life Star is a rule book no human can write. Rules can't be added, fudged, or abused, only uncovered. Happily, we already use this rule book. It's helped us truly understand our world in areas like chemistry, biology and physics. Of course I'm speaking about Nature; where scientists often feel the majic of discovering rules. Thus we replace human-made rule book, which Darth Blockbuster can so easily corrupt, with one that is uncorruptable.

The chemists, physists, doctors, and engineers who already use Nature often argue, and debate. They settle their differences much more often with tests of the uncorruptable rule book. Many happily think "failure is always an option", because while we can't add rules to Nature, we can strike off possibilities and thus get closer to an answer.

I'll explain how we use Nature to make the Life Star by asking you a question you can't answer. How old are you?

## The Life Star's First Brick

How old are you. Simple question solved by simple math. Start from your birth day and count how many times you've circled the Sun. It's a fact in all our laws, religions, and science. When we compare each other, objects, or thoughts, we use birthdays. That is how we tell time.

What if someone told you, like a witch or wizard, when you die. Would you still count the days past? Or would you start counting the days left? Wouldn't we live better if we knew our deathday? No more thinking we'll make up for wasted time "later". How many days in traffic, useless meetings, or stress inducing interviews are fueled with "later”? Later implies endless life, stories, and growth. Later is a lie. That's why no stories are about later. Because the stories worth telling happen now. To really live, we must realize our story ends.

If we want a great life, we need to know our deathday. Outside of an asteroid hitting the planet, a rare disease, or some other calamity, let's find it. In fact, we're inventing this tool to find it. We'll give you life by telling you when you die. How exciting! Better yet, you can control this tool; the more good choices you make, the better health you have, and the more life you buy.

Enter our first problem. We don't know what good choices are. Today we notice trends and point out "good choices" with diets, religions or ideologies. But there's a gap in knowledge for your specific life. Because your choices are not tailored for your genetics, diet, or circumstance. To give you more life, we must know much more about yours.

So, our new tool must track everything you eat and do. Only then can we empower you to buy better health and live a better life. We'll get to work. Once we're done making this new tool would you buy it? Maybe for someone's birthday?

Don't, because you already own it. So do you all your friends. Even your enemies. Your body is that tool. Your body tracks exactly what you do, and determines your health. Outside of calamity, your choices do determine how healthy you'll be and when you'll die.

So why don't we know more about our health? Why is our deathday and good choices such a mystery. The problem isn't our bodies. Nature did a great job. Our natural senses can't tell us our health because our prosperous economy made us independent of natural limitations. Prosperity gave us unfettered choices. Our natural senses can't read our biology fast enough to compensate. Smell, touch, taste, sight and sound are not good enough to warn of diabetes, cancer, or depression. Thus, it takes years for our unfettered choices to becomes problems big enough to notice with our biological tools. Today we compensate with medicine to reduce bad health and recommend better choices. We're getting better. Still each person doesn't know, at the point of decision, which choice is good or bad. So we live in ignorance and in bad health.

This is good news. Because the Life Star can be simpler. It only needs to augment our natural senses with better cyborgology. We need to track what we eat and do, and regularly test our bodies. This way we can analyze which choices improve, or hurt, our health. Thus, we can buy more days, know our futures, and finally enjoy our stories.

What will happen when we invent the Life Star and see ourselves in a new light? Let's look at history. What happened when we invented the glass mirror? Imagine what it was like seeing your physical self for the first time. No more guessing, no one else's opinion, no more using a polished piece of metal; only the truth. The modern mirror is a very advanced tool. It was made in the 14th century but not perfected and mass produced until the 19th century. Today, mirrors show us a reality we all take for granted. A mirror empowers you to see your face, your technique, your youth, your wounds, your smile. Now we are inventing a new mirror. A new tool that similarly shows us the truth in real time. And what will happen when we see our psychological selves as if looking at a mirror?

We get a more accurate reality. Don't say it's impossible. Nature's infinite Universe dazzles us (whenever we look) to know impossible is nothing. The Life Star is a new psychological mirror that will change human decision making and taste and thereby solve our poor health with.

In fact, we already are. Fitbits, smartwatches, and genetic testing, are just the beginning of the Life Star. We're well on the path to showing ourselves the consequences of our actions in real time. The Life Star's been in development for decades. Even if we didn't realize it, we'll soon see our psychological selves in a new mirror. No more polished pieces of metal, opinions, or guesses. Soon we'll see the truth.

The truth is we'll probably never know our deathday. But we'll get close. We'll see which choices give us vitality. The vitality to live a great story. Because knowing how many steps you took yesterday, tells you how many steps you could take today. And knowing how many total steps you've taken, roughly tells you how many days you have left to take them. The Life Star will show us, and everyone around us, our vitality. Our biological sense will get augmented. And after that, we'll be empowered to live like we're dying. We'll have the best of both worlds. We'll have a prosperous economy and the ability make good choices inside it. Because the truth of a mirror is too clear to ignore.

## More

That was just a creative way to say we don't know jack. And it's only with tools we learn anything.

Galileo's telescope changed the world. For centuries everyone thought the Earth was the center of the Universe. An ancient Greek genius named Aristarchus said we revolved around the Sun, he used a well, the tower of Alexandria, and the pytagoran theorum to correctly figure out the relative sizes of Earth, Moon, and Sun, and reasons why the humongous Sun would revolve around a tiny Earth.

But, with the naked it, it looks like it does. So, that's the answer the world put into the rule book. Copernicus used modern math to say maybe Aristarchus was right. Friar Bruno advocated "Copernicism" very publicly and was burned alive.

Galileo advoated just like Bruno did, except he said sorry when facing the antagonists. Under his breadth Galileo did stick it to him by saying "but it moves".

Most people know Galileo and not Bruno because of the former made a telescope. He literally saw the truth himself, and wrote books about what he saw. The telescope made new cyborgs who majically bonded with the new tool, and obsessively made it better and better.

The first image is always gritty. But it's still magical. This is what it looking through Galileo's telescope saw. This image led humanity away from human made rules, and into the one of Nature made rules. We're doing the same with our Life Star.

## We Don't Know Jack

We've lived under human made rules for centuries. Economic policy, political ideologies, product design, manufacturing, and marketing are all based on what we sense with only our biological tools.

We don't even know how old we are, or our probable death date. Ask a veterinarian bringing a abandoned dog back to health. She'll know its weight, height, blood work, exercise requirements, psycological profile, and tailor a meal, exercise, and socialization plan for it.

We decide our food by walking down an aisle and picking up a item for no more reason than Darth Vader is on it.

It's not our fault. Our cyborgology simply doesn't sense the better choice yet. Blaming the bad health choice is like blaming the dog for being abandoned. And if you have perfect health and thus think you can criticize, this is only one area whereby our human made rules ruin us. Ask yourself this.

How much money do you have, is not the same as asking how much money are you worth. Do you work to make a contribution to your economy, or your company. Are you naturally generous, or selfish. How often do you have psychological evaluations. What about blood work? How do you track your diet? Do you even think of your cyborgology? Do you understand the effects of walking to work versus driving in traffic? How often do you fly? How big is your own personal hole in the ozone layer? Do you buy American or foreign? Do you love the majic of teaching new tools, or the dark majic addiction to old ones?

That's only a fraction of what the Life Star will show us. Things get real interesting when we point the Life Star at our society.

How old are our roads. Should we rebuild them, or make internet faster and cheaper instead. What about our sewage system, what's it cost to maintain, rebuild, and are there better options. What about insurance, how much is spent on damages, verus administration.

The pay gap, does it exist, and if so specifically where, when, and with who. Who joins the military and volunteers, which populations, which persons, which cultures and religions contribute more often. What's the social trust between ethnicities. What effect does many different languages have on societies. Does white flight still exist, and if so when and who, specifically.

If you feel angsy asking these questions, you should. Remember Friar Bruno. He was burned alive just for saying human made rules would fall to Nature. But also remember Sophia. The majic of new tools, is stronger than the safety of using old ones. Digital tools will tell us these answers anyone.

Like with science, its the person who asks them first, who wins the power of knowing the natural truth.

## Stuttering ~~Helped~~ Teaches This Lesson

I already told you about my stutter. I'll use it again her to make a point. My first language was gibberish. No joke. Until grade 3 nobody had much idea what the heck I was talking about. Most people's speech dysfluency (saying "ah", "eh", "umm") is about 5% of their words. Mine was probably 80%. Come grade 3 my teacher and the school's special education teacher told my parents I needed an assessment to find out what was wrong.

I still remember that intelligence test. Among some pluses and minuses, speech therapy was recommended (and thankfully) paid for by the public school board. So I was a nine year old, being told by a psychologist, I had a problem with my genetics, and I needed therapy, grueling therapy at times, to fix my genetic problem.

Speech Therapy helped a lot. Specialists using techniques and tools to help me overcome my problem. My dysfluency got to about 80%. Still very noticeable at times, and still hard to live with, but I started using the phone. My first call was to a pet store asking if they had huskies.

This story illustrates life under the Life Star. I was lucky my problem was noticable by our biology. Even though the impediment is still a mystery, speech therapists really know how to help. Even when that jerk VP said I was an embarrassment, I knew the techniques to use again, to really beat the gremlin because of speech therapy.

Like inside any ecosystem, the more lifeforms there are, the faster the pain of the frontline is felt, adapted to, and solved. More lifeforms probe

Now, imagine people prone to depression, eating disorders, or stupid economic policies. Today these people only meet their specialist after suffering years of depression, being way over or under weight, or with needle marks in the arms. They suffer because they don't know themselves. And everyone's got a thing to work on, be it arrogance, self-pity, shyness, or whatever.

- protagonist always used the Nature rule book. They invent new tools to solve problems. Onec an only solve problems by assessing reality, not the imagined worlds of human made rules.
