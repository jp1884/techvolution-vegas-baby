# LIFE STAR

Have to integrate the next several chapters into a Life Star sequence, and use these topics as filters, toggles, moons of Jupiter, to showcase a ruling philosophy that, like a physicist and biologist does today, uses science to find the truth, not personal opinions absent of better sensory input like telescopes, microscopes and such...

- There's something about Life Star, and Sun, and knowledge, telling us the age/rules. The Sun tell us our age in revolutions, but Life Star tells us our scientific age.
- Notably, once Techvolution frees people to choose their own tools, it's the majic of millions of people, that builds our Life Star.

That damn Obi-Wan. He probably turned into a ghost like in the movie and went on vacation or wherever. But no worries. For I am Skywalker, the person destined to save the galaxy and bring balance to human evolution. So here we go. We're going to build the Life Star.

Light is the opposite of dark the same way full is the opposite of empty. Knowing one, defines the other. The Death Star is a rule book written by Sith Lords. The Life Star is the opposite of the Death Star.

So what is it? The Life Star is a rule book no one can control. Rules can't be added, fudged, or abused, only uncovered. Happily, we already use this rule book. It has helped us truly understanding our world in areas like chemistry, biology and physics. Of course I'm speaking about Nature.

And of course we learned Nature with tools. It was microscopes, telescopes, and all the other scientific tools that merged with our natural senses, to probe Nature, and let us uncover its rules in every more detail.

Unlocking Nature's rules slowly undercut Darth Kings divinity. Now our digital tools under cut not only Darth Blockbuster's, but also the Sith's ability to make future Death Stars. Because once we build the Life Star, there's no room left for human made rules. The only rule will be natural selection of our own tools with unhindered Techvolution.

I'll explain the Life Star by asking you a question you can't answer. How old are you?

## The Life Star's First Brick

How old are you. Simple question solved by simple math. Start from your birth day and count how many times you've circled the Sun. It's a fact in all our laws, religions, and science. When we compare each other, objects, or thoughts, we use birthdays. That is how we tell time.

What if someone told you, like a witch or wizard, when you die. Would you still count the days past? Or would you start counting the days left? Wouldn't we live better if we knew our deathday? No more thinking we'll make up for wasted time "later". How many days in traffic, useless meetings, or stress inducing interviews are fueled with "later‚Äù? Later implies endless life, stories, and growth. Later is a lie. That's why no stories are about later. Because the stories worth telling happen now. To really live, we must realize our story ends.

If we want a great life, we need to know our deathday. Outside of an asteroid hitting the planet, a rare disease, or some other calamity, let's find it. Let's invent a tool to find it. We'll give you life by telling you when you die. How exciting! Better yet, you can control this tool; the more good choices you make, the better health you have, and the more life you buy.

Enter our first problem. We don't know what good choices are. Today we notice trends and point out "good choices" with diets, religions or ideologies. But there's a gap in knowledge for your specific life. Because your choices are not tailored for your genetics, diet, or circumstance. To give you more life, we must know much more about yours.

So, our new tool must track everything you eat and do. Only then can we empower you to buy better health and live a better life. We'll get to work. Once we're done making this new tool would you buy it? Maybe for someone's birthday?

Don't, because you already own it. So do you all your friends. Even your enemies. Your body is that tool. Your body tracks exactly what you do, and determines your health. Outside of calamity, your choices do determine how healthy you'll be and when you'll die.

So why don't we know more about our health? Why is our deathday and good choices such a mystery. The problem isn't our bodies. Nature did a great job. Our natural senses can't tell us our health because our prosperous economy made us independent of natural limitations. Prosperity gave us unfettered choices. Our natural senses can't read our biology fast enough to compensate. Smell, touch, taste, sight and sound are not good enough to warn of diabetes, cancer, or depression. Thus, it takes years for our unfettered choices to becomes problems big enough to notice with our biological tools. Today we compensate with medicine to reduce bad health and recommend better choices. We're getting better. Still each person doesn't know, at the point of decision, which choice is good or bad. So we live in ignorance and in bad health.

This is good news. Because our new tool can be simpler. Like other cyborgology, our tool only needs to augment our natural senses. We need to track what we eat and do, and regularly test our bodies. We need to use our tool to proactively assess own biological tools. This way we can analyze which choices improve, or hurt, our health. Thus, we can buy more days, know our futures, and finally enjoy our stories.

What will happen when we invent this miraculous tool? Let's look at history. What happened when we invented the modern glass mirror? Imagine what it was like seeing your physical self for the first time. No more guessing, no one else's opinion, no more using a polished piece of metal; only the truth. The modern mirror is a very advanced tool. It was made in the 14th century but not perfected and mass produced until the 19th century. Today, mirrors show us a reality we all take for granted. A mirror empowers you to see your face, your technique, your youth, your wounds, your smile. Now we are inventing a new mirror. A new tool that similarly shows us the truth in real time. And what will happen when we see our psychological selves as if looking at a mirror?

We get a more accurate reality. Don't say it's impossible. Nature's infinite Universe dazzles us (whenever we look) to know impossible is nothing. And today we looked and invented a small little idea, we're only waiting on the technology to make it real. We will invent it, and mass produce it too. Because life wont let us throw away the prosperity that grants us unfettered choices. So we must adapt ourselves to it. Thus, human decision making and taste will get augmented by a new tool. We will solve our poor health with a new psychological mirror.

In fact, we already are. Fitbits, smartwatches, and genetic testing, are just the beginning. We're on the path to showing ourselves the consequences of our actions in real time. So, our new tool isn't even new, it's been in development for decades. Life is a trickster, it's made modern tools by making it a toy so that we wouldn't realize how that toy will change our ruling philosophy that rewards self-indulgence. Even if we didn't realize it, we'll soon see our psychological selves in a new mirror. No more polished pieces of metal, opinions, or guesses. Soon we'll see the truth.

The truth is we'll probably never know our deathday. But we'll get close. We'll see which choices give us vitality. The vitality to live a great story. Because knowing how many steps you took yesterday, tells you how many steps you could take today. And knowing how many total steps you've taken, roughly tells you how many days you have left to take them. Technology will show us, and everyone around us, our vitality. Our biological sense will get augmented. And after that, we'll be empowered to live like we're dying. We'll have the best of both worlds. We'll have a prosperous economy and the ability make good choices inside it. Because the truth of a mirror is too clear to ignore.

## More

That was just a creative way to say we don't know jack. And it's only with tools we learn anything. How old are we is asking one of a million questions we simply don't know. Not because we can't know. We just don't have the tools yet to prove Nature and find the truth.

How much money do you have, is not the same as asking how much money are you worth. Do you work to make a contribution to your economy or your company. Are you naturally generous, or selfish. How often do you have psychological evaluations. What about blood work? How do you track your diet? Do you even think of your cyborgology? Do you understand the effects of walking to work versus driving in traffic? Can you tell the different between the majic of learning functional new tools solving real life problems, or the distraction from function of the spectacle and art of dark majic.

What about our society. How old are our roads. Should we rebuild them, or make internet faster and cheaper instead. What about our sewage system, what's it cost to maintain, rebuild, and are there better options. What about insurance, how much is spent on damages, verus administration. I can say for sure, after a car accidents most drivers leave the scene without even the other guys information. Fittingly, most everyone can't even remember the brand, colour, or even style of automobile they were in an accident with. Ford, Chevy, red, blue, sedan or crossover, all looks the same. Ironic because we individual drive around in marketing deluded stytle thinking everyone is envious of our ride.

To return to the red / blue story for a few seconds. The pay gap, does it exist, and if so specifically where, when, and with who. Who joins the military and volunteers, which populations, which persons, which cultures and religions contribute more often. What's the social trust between and inside ethnicities. What effect does many different languages have on societies. Does white flight still exist, and if so when and who.

A biologist knows and studies these questions. They track lifeforms, study their diets, their very cells with microscopes and spectrometers. A biologist would know the life expectancy of their subjects. There's a lot more data on them, then on you. A physict have many differeent telescopes and uses super computers to answer their questions. A chemist, botanist, surgeon, and every other scientific field studies not human created rules, but the effectual truth of Nature.

We can do the same for ourselves, once we ignore human created rules, and instead build tools to answer our questions, about the effectual truth of our actions. We'll start to know how old we are. Notably, once Techvolution frees people to choose their own tools, it's the majic of millions of people, knowing and understanding their cyborgology, that builds our Life Star.

## Stuttering ~~Helped~~ Teaches This

My first language was gibberish. No joke. Until grade 3 nobody had much idea what the heck I was talking about. Most people's speech dysfluency (saying "ah", "eh", "umm") is about 5% of their words. Mine was probably 80%. Come grade 3 my teacher and the school's special education teacher told my parents I needed an assessment to find out what was wrong.

I still remember that intelligence test. All sorts of questions and assessments. I was asked to tell a story from a picture, do lots of match questions, and I worked on the equations with imaginary numbers on my knee for some reason. Among some pluses and minuses, speech therapy was recommended (and thankfully) paid for by the public school board. So I was a nine year old, being told by a psychologist, I had a problem with my genetics, and I needed therapy, grueling therapy at times, to fix my genetic problem.

Speech Therapy helped a lot. Specialists using techniques and tools to help me overcome my problem. My dysfluency was at about 80%. Still very noticeable at times, and still hard to live with, but way better.

Now, imagine people prone to depression, eating disorders, or addictive behavior. Today these people only meet their specialist after suffering years of depression, being way over or under weight, or with needle marks in the arms. They suffer because they don't know themselves. And everyone's got a thing to work on, be it arrogance, self-pity, shyness, or whatever.

Yet, whatever we have, is hidden from us, because we can't sense it. My luck was having a problem easily detectable by our biology. Yet most people have something that's not. The technological mirror we are making with FitBits, smart watches, big data, and so much more, will start revealing ourselves to us. And it's _exactly_ like how the mirrors inside the telescope showed the Universe to Galileo and the ruling nobility. Our telescope will reveal truths our ruling philosophy doesn't want us to realize. Yet it's coming anyway. It's the first step to building our Life Star.
