# LIFE STAR

Have to integrate the next several chapters into a Life Star sequence, and use these topics as filters, toggles, moons of Jupiter, to showcase a ruling philosophy that, like a physicist and biologist does today, uses science to find the truth, not personal opinions absent of better sensory input like telescopes, microscopes and such...

- There's something about Life Star, and Sun, and knowledge, telling us the age/rules. The Sun tell us our age in revolutions, but Life Star tells us our scientific age.

Light is the opposite of dark. Full is the opposite of empty. Frozen is the opposit of wet. Knowing one, defines the other. The Death Star is a rule book written by Sith Lords, bent on keeping power for themselves. The Life Star is the opposite of the Death Star.

So what is it? The Life Star is a rule book no one controls. Rules can't be added, fudged, or abused, only uncovered. Happily, we already use this rule book. It has helped us truly understand our world in areas like chemistry, biology and physics. Of course this rule book is Nature.

And of course we learned Nature with the evolution of our cyborgology. It was microscopes, telescopes, and all the other scientific tools, that merged with our natural senses, to probe Nature, and let us uncover its rules in every more detail.

These tools slowly undercut Darth Kings divinity. Now our digital tools under cut not only Darth Blockbuster's, but also his ability to make future Death Stars. Because once we build the Life Star, there's no room left for its opposite.

I'll explain this all by asking you a question you can't answer. How old are you?

## The Life Star's First Brick

How old are you. Simple question solved by simple math. Start from your birth day and count how many times you've circled the Sun. It's a fact in all our laws, religions, and science. When we compare each other, objects, or thoughts, we use birthdays. That is how we tell time.

What if someone told you, like a witch or wizard, when you die. Would you still count the days past? Or would you start counting the days left? Wouldn't we live better if we knew our deathday? No more thinking we'll make up for wasted time "later". How many days in traffic, useless meetings, or stress inducing interviews are fueled with "later‚Äù? Later implies endless life, stories, and growth. Later is a lie. That's why no stories are about later. Because the stories worth telling happen now. To really live, we must realize our story ends.

If we want a great life, we need to know our deathday. Outside of an asteroid hitting the planet, a rare disease, or some other calamity, let's find it. Let's invent a tool to find it. We'll give you life by telling you when you die. How exciting! Better yet, you can control this tool; the more good choices you make, the better health you have, and the more life you buy.

Enter our first problem. We don't know what good choices are. Today we notice trends and point out "good choices" with diets, religions or ideologies. But there's a gap in knowledge for your specific life. Because your choices are not tailored for your genetics, diet, or circumstance. To give you more life, we must know much more about yours.

So, our new tool must track everything you eat and do. Only then can we empower you to buy better health and live a better life. We'll get to work. Once we're done making this new tool would you buy it? Maybe for someone's birthday?

Don't, because you already own it. So do you all your friends. Even your enemies. Your body is that tool. Your body tracks exactly what you do, and determines your health. Outside of calamity, your choices do determine how healthy you'll be and when you'll die.

So why don't we know more about our health? Why is our deathday and good choices such a mystery. The problem isn't our bodies. Nature did a great job. Our natural senses can't tell us our health because our prosperous economy made us independent of natural limitations. Prosperity gave us unfettered choices. Our natural senses can't read our biology fast enough to compensate. Smell, touch, taste, sight and sound are not good enough to warn of diabetes, cancer, or depression. Thus, it takes years for our unfettered choices to becomes problems big enough to notice with our biological tools. Today we compensate with medicine to reduce bad health and recommend better choices. We're getting better. Still each person doesn't know, at the point of decision, which choice is good or bad. So we live in ignorance and in bad health.

This is good news. Because our new tool can be simpler. Like other cyborgology, our tool only needs to augment our natural senses. We need to track what we eat and do, and regularly test our bodies. We need to use our tool to proactively assess own biological tools. This way we can analyze which choices improve, or hurt, our health. Thus, we can buy more days, know our futures, and finally enjoy our stories.

What will happen when we invent this miraculous tool? Let's look at history. What happened when we invented the modern glass mirror? Imagine what it was like seeing your physical self for the first time. No more guessing, no one else's opinion, no more using a polished piece of metal; only the truth. The modern mirror is a very advanced tool. It was made in the 14th century but not perfected and mass produced until the 19th century. Today, mirrors show us a reality we all take for granted. A mirror empowers you to see your face, your technique, your youth, your wounds, your smile. Now we are inventing a new mirror. A new tool that similarly shows us the truth in real time. And what will happen when we see our psychological selves as if looking at a mirror?

We get a more accurate reality. Don't say it's impossible. Nature's infinite Universe dazzles us (whenever we look) to know impossible is nothing. And today we looked and invented a small little idea, we're only waiting on the technology to make it real. We will invent it, and mass produce it too. Because life wont let us throw away the prosperity that grants us unfettered choices. So we must adapt ourselves to it. Thus, human decision making and taste will get augmented by a new tool. We will solve our poor health with a new psychological mirror.

In fact, we already are. Fitbits, smartwatches, and genetic testing, are just the beginning. We're on the path to showing ourselves the consequences of our actions in real time. So, our new tool isn't even new, it's been in development for decades. Life is a trickster, it's made modern tools by making it a toy so that we wouldn't realize how that toy will change our ruling philosophy that rewards self-indulgence. Even if we didn't realize it, we'll soon see our psychological selves in a new mirror. No more polished pieces of metal, opinions, or guesses. Soon we'll see the truth.

The truth is we'll probably never know our deathday. But we'll get close. We'll see which choices give us vitality. The vitality to live a great story. Because knowing how many steps you took yesterday, tells you how many steps you could take today. And knowing how many total steps you've taken, roughly tells you how many days you have left to take them. Technology will show us, and everyone around us, our vitality. Our biological sense will get augmented. And after that, we'll be empowered to live like we're dying. We'll have the best of both worlds. We'll have a prosperous economy and the ability make good choices inside it. Because the truth of a mirror is too clear to ignore.

Our bodies represent Nature. They are biology. We can't control our bodies anymore than we can control the stars. We can manipulate ourselves, but it's only with tools that we change our cyborgology.

Yet, with old philosophies we ignore our Nature. We say Darth Blockbuster is our leader. We let culture determine our food. We let and other stuff. breaktime....
