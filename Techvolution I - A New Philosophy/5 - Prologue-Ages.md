Are you happy? On the outside Westerners have flashy products, full employment, and stable politics. On the inside our middle-class deals with stagnate wages, crushing debts, increasing inequality, antisocial behavior, political hatred, rat race lifestyles, climate change. We have the freedom to vote any ideology, and we've tried them all, yet our problems keep increasing. In this book I argue the middle-class needs a totally new philosophy, one that says we either step up to solve our own problems, or keep suffering the unknowns of a degenerating society.

## Dedication

_This book is for the people in the open-source community. For the unspoken philosophy you handed down to me. For moving us into the Digital Age by selflessly solving problems when updating Wikipedia, writing free software, and building cool new tech for us all. For showing me who the real protagonists are. You gave the best education a political guy can get. I hope I’ve learned enough to write this book._

_For the antagonists, the self-entitled delegators keeping Blockbuster—and its Industrial Age mentality—alive, thanks for causing history to repeat itself yet again. I hope you learn something._

_This is especially dedicated to the extras. Because when it’s time for you to act, I pray you pick the right side._

## Quote

"_We are really the revolutionaries in the world today—not the kids with long hair and beards who were wrecking the schools a few years ago._"

Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, 1973.

# Introduction

## Looking Up

How do we develop through technological Ages? Going from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age or the Medieval Age to Scientific Age happens over generations—it’s hard to get our head around. I’ve been thinking about it for years and only now have a grasp. There’s a lot to think about when a civilization’s entire way of life upgrades to new technology.

Play games like Age of Empires, Anno 1800, and Civilization, and you’ll get a good idea of how civilizations develop. You’ll be the "player god" that saves up the resources, invests in the science, and decides when to click "upgrade". When you do, civilization instantly transforms. Like magic, every house, factory, building, road, library, school is suddenly new and improved.

The above is just a game, of course. But we’re all in there somewhere, trying to figure out how to earn a living while our society transforms around us. It’s hard—there is no player god and no magic button. Instead, we, the people inside the game, must collect the resources, do the research, and manually upgrade every part of our civilization bit by bit with blood, sweat, and tears. We can’t sit back, click, and watch. We must live it.

Improving technology is hard work, but at least we understand how to do research and development. Improving politics isn’t so straightforward; especially when society has one foot in an old era, and one foot in a new era. This uncertainty is the world of politics and philosophy, civil wars, and revolutions I want to help you get a better sense of. Because in 1970, we entered the Digital Age. Since then, computer geeks, innovators, and hackers have been the protagonists upgrading our society and replacing industrial tools for digital ones—while the old Industrial Age powers in our society have been antagonists holding them back.

And that’s the reason life for the middle-class has gotten worse. Things will only improve once we finish the Digital Age upgrade. There’s no game, cheats, or gimmicks. There’s just you and your friends on Main Street. You all have to get out the sweat-bands, work gloves, and new ideas to upgrade every piece of our civilization to the Digital Age, bit by bit.

The job before us is as natural as evolution—and equally as difficult. Life only adapts and diversifies when new and improved lifeforms replace old ones. Likewise, right now, our civilization is moving from the Industrial Age to the Digital Age. You can’t sit out. Either you help our evolution, or old it back.

This book integrates lessons from the history, politics, and philosophy of prior upgrades, but it’s not written for any buff. It uses the power of stories to help the people inside today’s game—the middle-class—improve their own lives. The first step is a new mindset. Because we already have digital tools. We only need the middle-class to believe in a new philosophy to enjoy all the wonders of the Digital Age.

## Looking Up to Political Philosophy

This book’s illustration is a regular person standing on Main Street-a single person in the game of civilization. His or her job is to do what's best for themselves, and help society prosper. She’s looking up for guidance and sees two options—heroes and villains. In the sky high above is the "player god" whose playing the game. Will the player god, play to benefit society, or to benefit himself?

In the computer game, when the player god presses the upgrade button, every character gets all-new tools: mud houses become brick houses, quills become pens, telephones become smartphones, and so on. Upgrading society like this happens when we shop, do home renovations, and "save up" for a new cool thing. Our choices—like shopping, diet, education—determine the health of our entire civilization. Yet we often don't think of ourselves as being "player gods". But that's the big picture isn't it? That in fact, it's all our individual choices that make up the player god in the game of our own civilization.

The more individuals realize the big picture, and act like their actions matter, the healthier their society. And the job of inspiring individuals to believe in the big picture is the world of political philosophy.

But what the heck is the big picture? Every newspaper, politician, and political party says they're the heroes. But politics has so much disagreement. How can the regular person on Main Street know the difference between heroes and villians? What's defines good and bad political opinions?

So there you are, on Main Street, looking up, trying to figure if Donald Trump is evil, or if the United Nations is trying to make a world government. You ask if Fox News is manufacturing fake news, or maybe "all of them" are. If so, what’s real news? The questions never stop. Should the government-run health insurance, or a big corporation regulated by the government? Is climate change real? If so why does my "green" obsessed company force me to drive to work everyday? Whose fault is massive government debt? If no one takes responsibility for the debt, what's the point of blaming anyone?

It’s all very confusing and emotional. And you have to pick sides. After all, you're part of the player god as much as anyone else. Wouldn’t it be cool if your political philosophy showed you the difference between good and bad politics today? It is cool; it’s calming to understand politics and to make choices you know will win the game. And it's one reason why I wrote this book. So I, and whoever reads it, can better understand what's wrong with today's politics—and understand the new philosophy we all need to believe in so our society's prospers in the Digital Age.

## Your Politics

When a computer player in a civilization game "upgrades" technology, we can see technology changed. Damning a river, building a road, or putting up telephone poles is very obvious.

When the computer player "upgrades" the game’s philosophy, he installs a new ruling philosophy. For example, going from Divine Monarchy to American Democracy. But we can’t see this change in real-world objects. The change happens in our minds.

For example, when America upgraded upgrade from Monarchy, every American on Main Street looked up and asks, "What does American Democracy mean?". The person asks if they're I supposed to be conservative or progressive? Libertarian or socialist? Republican or Democrat?" Factions like these are interpretations of the ruling philosophy—in this case, American Democracy. A person uses factions—often called ideologies—to decide what the big picture is and to help them make their own political opinions.

Technology, government, and political upgrades really are as simple as hitting "upgrade" like the player does in the clip above. It's just so damn hard to see when it comes to philosophy, because it's our own minds that is changing.

That being said, people are good at expressing and fighting for their political opinions. We argue, debate, vote, and read books, and listen to radio shows. But understanding where our mindset comes from is entirely different. Nobody ever says, "My family is old money, so I’m coasting through life. In fact, I only work when I have to protect my entitlement; what most people would call undeserved inheritance". Instead, the person says, "White privilege doesn’t exist stupid!" Nobody says, "I’m a gullible person who works with lots of Liberal Arts graduates at a paper distribution company head office, so I say xher, and I don’t like Donald Trump because the crowd hates him." instead that person says; "Trump is not presidential!"

The point is, the real reason for your political opinions is hard to know. We all look up at the same ruling philosophy; we all try to "think of the big picture," yet we arrive at different answers. Our opinions are a by-product of our psychology, job, skillset, family, culture, ethnicity, religion, and time-period. Who can understand how all these factors intermix to make a political opinion? Why does one parent cry tears of sadness, the other of joy, on the same election night?

I can’t explain it either. But I can explain where you are in the story of civilization. Because when civilization upgrades to a new Age, everyone is divided up into predictable a cast of characters. Some people fight to retain power for themselves, some people fight to distribute power to the people, and the people—the ones on Main Street—either help the good guys or don’t. The good guys are the heroes of the new Age. The bad guys are the villians who want to hold back progress. And a person either helps the good guys upgrade civilization, or doesn’t.

Today this translates to digital technologists fighting to give the power of new digital technology to the people on Main Street. The people who control the Industrial Age technology are fighting them off. And the people on Main Street have a choice, do they step up to help the good guys? To help the good guys, the people need to believe in a new ruling philosophy.

## Read Now or Read Later

There’s a heck of a lot of emotions in Western politics today. Better put—people fucking hate each other. And many of those people know why. They’re just mad. And not mad in the "I stepped in the puddle" sort of way. Mad in the comic book supervillain whose plans for world domination are going up in smoke "because the other side is ruining everything!" sort of way.

Let’s get some perspective. Democracy plus Free Market Economics are our ruling philosophy. They both spread around the world on the back of the Industrial Age. Conservatism and Progressivism were the biggest factions of that ruling philosophy. Now, at the start of the Digital Age, we need a new philosophy made for the Digital Age. But rather than rethink hundreds of years of "Left vs. Right" politics, each side blames each other for being outdated. Businessmen keep conservatism alive by "fighting communists", while social justice warriors keep progressivism alive by "fighting facists". Fascism and communism died decades ago. Nevertheless, Left and Right use these phantoms as villians in their books, TV shows, and political rallies to keep their believers hooked. Left and Right want to distract us—and themselves—because neither side understands the Digital Age. They pretend it doesn't exist.

We've upgraded our ruling philosohy before. Ruling philosophies die when their factions kill each other off. The Thirty Years War (1618-1648) is an example. It was a time everyone believed in Monarchy and had two factions to follow; Catholics and Protestants. Regular people on Main Street picked a side and killed each other for thirty years on behalf of "holy" kings. What regular people were really sick of was all kings. Thus, it wasn't long until regular people fought for a new ruling philosophy (Democracy) in the American Revolution (1776) and French Revolution (1789). Today Left and Right are in similar boat. They each survive by hating each other. Impeachments, disputed elections, rallies, and political deadlock are what two factions do when neither can admit they're out of new ideas.

Conservativism and Progressivism helped us achieve great things in the Industrial Age. It wasn’t perfect, but new tools in medicine, physics, sanitation, education, agriculture empowered us to fight disease, ignorance, and hunger. But we’re not in the Industrial Age anymore. But we, the people on Main Street, are stuck using it's old philosophy and factions, in the Digital Age.

There’s a good reason why players in civilization computer games build new cities, farms, sewers, and roads. These are the things that make a civilization great. Politics is only supposed to help people in real-life work together, see the big picture, and play the game well; it’s not about insulting your neighbor or painting your face. Because we only have Left or Right politics to believe in, regular people think voting or yelling at the TV is being political. Bullshit. Politics is about every single choice you make being made with the big picture in mind.

Do you watch TV or exercise at night. Do you read a book or watch infotainment. Do you seal your leaky taps or rant about climate change with another tweet. You are a single person in the game. You can only change your actions. And your actions are pivotal. Because you're the player god. If you don't think so, nobody else does too. And that's the best sign we need to uprade our political philosophy—so we all see the big picture again.

We need a new philosophy. One that isn’t spoken by battle-worn ideologues, that doesn’t scare regular people away with "the other side is evil", that doesn't make people think watching TV helps their society win. We need a philosophy that looks ahead towards the boundless horizon of the Digital Age. One that sees Tesla, SpaceX, Blue Origin, as a sneak peek for the wondrous Digital Age future each person should be building now, bit by bit.

I could have written this has a political theory book or a history book. But I didn’t. It’s written as how-to-manual to the people on Main Street right now. Here's how we get back to work and win the game. It's particularly written to the ones sick of contemporary politics but who love checking-out what Elon is up to. People who’ve played Total War, SimCity, and Civilization and have been the player god in virtual reality, but who also realize it’s the actions of regular people on Main Street that make up the player god in reality. People who can understand that with digital tools, most of today’s political talking points, like road traffic, hospital wait-times, expensive education, are engineering problems, not political problems. People who realize they either see themselves in the video below, or evolution will find someone who does.

Humanity will continue the blessed journey of civilization one way or another. I wrote this book to get us there faster and easier. It's written to be like Second Treatise of Government, On Social Contract, and Common Sense. All books that made the people on Main Street realize the big picture, that we're all the player god. And if we don’t step up to upgrade our political philosophy to the Digital Age, we'll keep suffering the unknowns of a degenerating society that keeps looking down at phantom socialists and facists, instead of looking up to our future in the stars.

If we don't upgrade our philosophy, at least with this book we can read what we could have done as we regret the choices of a player god who lost the game.

I can only say I hope people will read this. Writer David Mamet once said being free from trying to please a group means being free to concentrate on Nature. So I was happily ambitious when writing this book. Saying that Techvolution is divided into three parts:

**A New Philosophy:** Upgrades our political philosophy to the Digital Age. This book empowers digital protagonists—like Gates, Torvalds, and Musk—with the mass support of Main Street, by getting people to use tools to solve humanity's problems and again see their choices as being expressions of their politics and identity.

**Building the Life Star:** Explains the new political and economic truth we’ll see in the Digital Age. Using digital tools like big data, bio-monitors, bitcoin; the Life Star will give us much more accurate definitions of political and economic right and wrong that’ll help us remove much political uncertainty in society. In short, the Life Star will do for politics and economics what scientific instruments did for physics and chemistry.

**Starting Starfleet:** In this part, we’ll conceptualize digital products totally detached from the Industrial Age. These products will make The Digital Age lifestyle one of "perpetual profit".  We’ll send the massive savings to Musk and his protegees and hence, start Starfleet.

===

I want to be crystal clear about the purpose of this book. We're in the new and wondrous Digital Age. But we're using the political philosophy of the Industrial Age. That means not since the conservatism and progressivm cards were clicked in 1791, and 1855 respectively, have we had new ideas in politics.

We need a new philosophy that factors in the all the wondrous possibilities of digital technology. We need a philosophy that empowers the people on Main Street to again see the big picture; that they're player gods whose choices determine the health of society. Watching TV isn't politics. Making good choices is politics. You should still vote, still debate what's best for our society, but making good choices is your strongest political power—if other people don't follow, leave them behind.

The people on Main Street today, the people on the frontline, thus have the responsibility to find tools to solve their own problems, which thereby solves the problems—like outrageous executive pay, glass ceilings, expensive car repairs—that plague the middle class. The player gods responsibility to solve problems also requires the freedom to choose any tool they want.

Tools can be anything. From caulking that seals leaky windows. To using the Waze app to lessen gridlock. To designing a custom 3D printed tool for your new business. The desire to seek out new tools is human evolution, which first happens in the human mind that reads a new philosophy. We've upgraded to a new philosophy before. The book below is the best way I know how to do it for our society today. I hope it's good enough to click.

# Prologue

## Digital Heroes

In 1970 our civlization entered the Digital Age. With every purchase, renovation, and Christmas gift since then, our society's technology has been upgrading. Digital tools are fundamentally different then mechanical tools; they can be reprogrammed, upgraded, and inter-linked. A single laptop can be a typewriter, radio, voice recorder, book, television, photo album, database, and so many other machines. In contrast, mechanical tools are single-use, can't be easily shared, and have to be regulated to ensure whoever controls them thinks of society's best interest.

Since 1970, protagonists have been inventing new digital tools. With every new computer, smartphone, website, and app, they've moved society further into the Digital Age.

Yet, digital tools have been brought up within the Industrial Age ruling philosophy. A philosophy meant to foster growth of mechanical tools via relentless worldwide competition; best seen when business news coverage obessses over "world markets" and daily stock prices. Since digital tools are so cheap and powerful, they've been creating their own political philosophy; one that fosters collaboration and community. Digital collaboration is the future because it's much more efficient; it saves us from a lot of redundant work. For example, with Wikipedia the world can use one website for its general knowledge, instead of reprinting, shipping, and buying millions of enclyopedia books every year.

Several generations from the start of the Digital Age, digital tools like smartphones, laptops, and smartwatches are so common, the collaboration philosophy they foster is even easier to use. Collaboration empowers people to work together. Think of IMDB, WikiHow, and YouTube videos about oil chances. We use to have to pay lots of money for this information. This is only the beginning. Collaboration is today's big picture; the basic princinple of the Digital Age's new political philosophy. The people who see this best is the open-source community.

Open-source is a community digital inventors, designers, and programmers. They are the successors of the first digital protagonists. Open-source are the Jedi leading us into the Digital Age. They work and gather at places like GitHub, Wikipedia, Dribbble, Udemy, Stack Overflow, Unsplash, Slack.

Open-source has changed the world, even if the world doesn’t know it yet. Most people on the frontline still think that retail stores, manufacturing, and education are industries only for governments or big businesses to control. Yet because of the open-source community, there are countless new tools available for the people to take control of their own products, identities, and lives. It’s truly a new world, one where Cinderella can walk off of Main Street, and go into the ball, simply because... everyone can.

The open-source community has busted down technological gates of the Industrial Age, so the people can share in our society’s economic prosperity using digital tools. It's because they believe in collaboration. Look around. Note the parents educating their own children on Khan Academy, the moms learning how to repair iPads for extra cash thanks to YouTube videos, the artists selling their own products on their own Wordpress websites, and the laid off workers using Rails to make their own apps. All these individuals could never afford mechanical tools. Yet with digital tools they can; and thereby these workers can work directly with other workers instead of going through middle-man of the Industrial Age.

All thanks to the open-source community. They've empowered regular people—used to being extras in the Industrial Age hoping for a better life—to start to become protagonist player-gods in the Digital Age making a better life.

I’m one of them. I’m a lone politics, history, and philosophy geek. Digital tools enable me to research, write, and host my own work. Better yet, I can find and collaborate with world-class writers and illustrators to make that work even better. A few decades ago, I’d be in a library scribbling notes on cue cards and dreaming up ways to get a professor, publisher, or newscaster to look my way.

As a kid, I helped my family clean office buildings. My easy role was to pick up the garbage and blue bins. It was very simple. Years later, when working at a big office, the cleaners were short-staffed for a few weeks. Management spent hours meeting about and discussing the "garbage problem" instead of just wrapping it up (pun intended) and moving on.

Mass producing clothes, cars, airplanes requires lots of coordination. Building and using mechanical tools need lots of managers. Digital Age tools let software do most of the management.

Today's excessive management is a holdover from an Age gone by. Many of our workplaces over-value control and delegation instead of contribution and collaboration. Excessive management turns leaders into gatekeepers who seek to hold tickets and manage who’ll "get access" to things like news services, retail stores, formal education, and especially the higher "positions" of corporate employment. Today's there's an entire class of middlemen, consultants, managers, and executives who don't even know the skills of their industry like nursing, teaching, and (definitely not) cleaning. They're skill is to manage the gates of an Industrial Age technology.

Comparing this world to the open-source community is like comparing the Stone Age to the Iron Age. The open-source community works together to make, improve, and open-up access to technology. Usually, the community's collaborates on a core technology and the community uses it to make their own specialized products. For example, open-source built MediaWiki, and then seperate groups use MediaWiki software to host Wikipedia, WikiHow, and Fandom.Because they all share the same core technology, there's no positions, copyrights, or patents to fight over. In this community, all are welcome; the more the merrier, regardless of whether you’re a genius programmer committing great code or an average user providing thoughtful feedback. Since everyone wants the best core product, everyone has incentive to defer to expert leaders. Installing gates, or being pig-headed, only hurts the technology the community is building together.

This is not to say that open-source communities are perfect. Some people are too rude, projects die off, personalities clash, and so forth. In The Innovators, author Walker Isaacson explains how the trifecta of academia, corporations, and militaries were optimal for creating the digital revolution. Likewise, it was government, enterprise, and open-source organizing structures that worked to keep that revolution going. Open-source is only a piece of the puzzle.

That said, it’s the vital piece.

In fact, the open-source movement is the next step in human evolution. Because nobody owns it, Industrial Age gatekeepers can't stop digital inventors pushing us into the Digital Age. Whether it's with a simple rotating list of persons to take out the trash, a online enclyclopia with millions of helpful articles, or advanced software to give society internet streaming, as when a few hackers tore down "Darth Blockbuster’s" gate when he tried to keep us all buying and borrowing his VHS tapes and DVDs.

Thus, calling open-source contributors Jedi’s isn’t a fantasy. They are the modern minutemen. The guardians of the people’s interest and betterment, who should be self-sufficient and very well-funded. But they are not. So many of people in the open-source community who write articles, answer forum questions, and make programs do it as a hobby, not a job. Even their leading organizations need donations to stay afloat. Meanwhile, old tools such as universities, television broadcasters, and insurance companies get massive subsidies, tax credits, and bailouts.

This huge difference between how the old and new tools are treated signifies our society’s great divide. Today open-source heroes work against the odds to dismantle the gates of mechanical tools that antagonists are paid to maintain.

Once upon a time, I only wanted to learn about the open-source fight. Now I want to empower its protagonists. Telecommuting, the right to repair, home power generation, and real internet privacy are just the tip of the iceberg; a better world is waiting for the middle-class once the open-source community has the resources to not only make new digital tools but to replace old Industrial Age tools, too. The open-source community must get political, get mad, and learn to be selfish because today’s battle is a tale as old as time, and as classic as the most universally told stories of New Age vs Old Age. Protagonists versus antagonists. Jedi versus Sith.

The most dangerous thing right now is ignorance. People don’t know about open-source or the future they're fighting for. The people are stuck on "right vs. left", or "red vs. blue" politics. Red/blue leaders tout their horns, and the believers march and yell like it’s Woodstock in 1969, because that was the end of the Industrial Age, and hence was the peak of their philosophy. The Woodstock time-period's way of life of single detached homes, 9-5 jobs, gas cars, long commutes, retail shopping, centralized power, and advertisement funded nightly news is glorified memory. It’s no wonder Main Street has suffered with outsourcing, micro-managing, and climate change when the political stage fights to keep the past alive.

The open-source community doesn't march for change. Their digital tools force it. I worked hard to turn their collaboration mindset into a new political philosophy which I call Techvolution. It’s custom-made for open-source and the Digital age. It combines centuries of historical and philosophical lessons most people don’t have the time to read. It cuts thru today’s political jargon with terms like "Darth Blockbuster," the "Death Star Rulebook," and "Jedi vs. Sith" so the people can ask themselves the biggest political question of our time.

It’s not the worn-out and drab "Am I for red or blue politics?" Instead, it’s something far more powerful and relevant: "Am I going to step up, and vastly improve my society’s way of life by bringing it into the Digital Age?"

The people don’t see this question. Although they're player gods, they’re distracted by the "dark majic show" of fantasy football stats, fancy car commercials, and bombastic political rhetoric to realize how empowered they are to change society without waiting for anyone’s approval. Their job today is to look up from Main Street and realize they're the players of the game who have the power and the respective responsibility to win it.

We all have the chance to turn the people into heroic players when a persons has yet another problem with their tax form, car radiator, asphalt shingles, or the countless other Industrial Age tools the gatekeepers maintain for their self-interest. This is when the pain of living on today’s frontline makes regular people search for a better way to live. And this moment is where we can educate others:

  >The Industiral Age is over. You don’t have to keep using their tools. You don’t have to be an extra waiting on hold, getting caught by the fine print, commuting through hellish traffic only to be micro-managed by eight different bosses. All that’s bullshit. You can take charge of your life. The open-source community invents digital tools so we can live a simpler, fairer, healthier, greener, happier life. But we need your help... because the only thing holding us back is our own ruling philosophy.

And when the regular person asks what the heck you’re talking about, you can tell them to read about Techvolution. Tell them it’s a new political philosophy to help the world realize how the digital tools empowers workers, creators, and contributors—basically, the people who are willing to step up to become heroic player gods, and not be left behind in a world the open-source movement has only begun to transform into the Digital Age.

## Busting the Gates

Currently, when you phone a call center, everything is recorded. The company has access to the recording; you don’t. Likewise, when the employee logs in and out of the office, that, too, is recorded. Management automatically has access to these timesheets; the employee doesn’t.

Access to things like phone recordings and timesheets are barriers or "gates". They're holdovers from the mechnical tools of the Industrial Age. They needlessly give power to one person over another. Customers can’t confirm what was agreed to during their last phone call, and employees can be grilled for a long lunch, yet unpaid overtime is easily forgotten by the same manager.

A lopsided balance of power allows customers and employees to be taken advantage of and encourages mistrust, bad products, and inefficient workplaces.

The greatness of the digital tools of the open-source community, is threefold. First, it sets a great example because it entrusts everyone with all information—good and bad—because why should people working together hold information back from each other. Collaboration requires open information. Second, open-source wants more members, so the community loves to bust open gates to get more people in. And third, since open-source technology is owned by the people, we can empower ourselves with tools that we once wrongly thought (or, in most cases, continue to think) only big companies are "allowed" to have, such as phone transcriptions and timesheets.

Busting open gates of mechanical tools moves us from the Industrial to Digital Age. It equalizes the balance of power, gives individuals dignity and responsibility. It treat people like adults and expects them to act like it, and therefore fosters collaboration. We have the technology to do this now. We just need the people to step up, participate, and demand it.

_This is an example of a GitHub "repo,". This one stores the core technology helps run apps like Basecamp, Airbnb and Shopify. A core team of paid pros maintain and do much of the programming. But all programmers, from elite to novice, individually ask questions, find bugs, contribute their work and it all comes together via GitHub’s software with minimal supervision. The process works similarly to Wikipedia. It’s very organized; even with over 5,000 contributors over 15 years, you can see who has done what and when. This software is priceless and is yours to use however you want. Get familiar with how open-source works. It’s a tell-tale sign for the openness, responsibility, and immense value of work cultures coming in the Digital Age. Waitresse, mechanics, teachers will all experience massive change. It will resemble how factories and production lines swept across our society during the Industrial Age. You should be happy. Once you experience how easy, effective, and powerful worker-to-worker collaboration is, it makes work much better. And the best part, no garbage meetings or delegators are needed._

# ACT ONE

## The Beginning

It all started with a door in my face. And then, actually, a few more. I was either being too stubborn or too hopeful. Either way, I eventually learned my lesson. I was selling a web app that those in upper management were never going to buy.

Before you wonder, it wasn’t a matter of price, because there was no price. It wasn’t a question of competition. None of that either. And I can promise it worked, because I had spent years in a cubicle doing the frontline job it worked for. After years of thinking about political and economic theory in the Digital Age, I’d written (another) book about some untapped possibilities of new tech like smartwatch apps, bio-monitors, and bitcoin. I only made this simple web app (using open-source technologies) to validate some of my ideas.

I was right to. They were good ideas. I figured out how to solve a problem—and save 100 million dollars, 300,000 hours of worker productivity, and even dozens of lives—just by fostering worker-to-worker collaboration with an app that was virtually free. Why wouldn’t I want to tell people about the theory behind it?

Sadly, I was a fool. I didn’t know it at the time, but I wasn’t even knocking on doors. I was knocking on gates. See, I wasn’t talking to the frontline workers—who thanked me—but to the bureaucrats, lawyers, managers, and executives who were well paid to "meet, discuss, delegate" about such "garbage" problems. As holdovers from the management of Industrial Age, I went against all they stood for; solving their problems was asking them to fire themselves. Worse, I was asking them to invalidate their identity as being "superiors". They put up gates to shut out, not promote, Digital Age innovation.

This was the dividing line. The spot where the Industiral Age took it's stand against human evolution.

That's why they never said no to me. No needs a reason. Instead, they simply said it was against the rules to say yes. You know—those obscure rules, hidden inside regulations and contracts. They believed in the rules, especially the one against frontline workers deciding on their own tools, and taking out their own garbage, so to speak.

Like anyone, I knew bringing new products to market is hard. I knew sales is difficult. I even knew antagonists exist. But I didn’t realize how defensive they about upgrading to the Digital Age. They masked their self-interest with self-righteous excuses. In their eyes I wasn't a innovator helping his society win the game, but just an "uppity extra".

I don’t want to talk about my experience too much; it’s just one example in a roiling sea of others. All that’s important is this: there was a huge problem costing millions of dollars, weeks of workers’ time (lots of it unpaid overtime), and maybe even your life—and it was against the rules to solve it. Even if I had won this battle for the Digital Age, it would be a tiny victory.

So instead, I’m going to talk about winning the war. Because this is hardly one example. From our hospitals to our schools, our airports, to our roads, we're being held back from the Digital Age by self-entitled holdovers of the Industrial Age.

The lesson was clear. Despite already having the digital technology to transform our way of life, antagonists maintain gates all over the place to protect the pre-digital "Woodstock of 1969" way of life because they know—even if subconsciously—they’d lose their status, positions, and identity in a Digital Age economy. To improve our lives then, the people need a new ruling philosophy... one that says improving our society is the only rule that matters.

## The Power Of Stories

Do you love stories? I think it’s a safe bet to say that you do. Who doesn’t? They entertain us after a hard day of work, bring us together to share our joys, and (my favorite) open our minds to the different rules and philosophies of foreign cities, mythical worlds, and galaxies far, far away.

Stories are so powerful because they’re so simple. Protagonists are good because they want to fix a problem. Antagonists are bad because they don’t. Stories aren’t debates. We take the protagonist’s side. Thus, Romeo and Juliet’s love is beautiful and worth dying for, while their families’ feud is ignorant and stupid. Luke Skywalker’s rebellion is righteous and worth fighting for, while Darth Vader’s empire is wicked and should be destroyed.

Our moral clarity about a problem turns the protagonists into our heroes and the antagonists into our villains. We thus follow their story with strong emotions, which burst out at the climax as we find out who wins.

Our hero fights hard to defeat the bad guys, but his superior morality, justice, and heroism aren’t enough. He’s often too weak or unskilled, and the villain beats him bloody. On the verge of failure, the hero needs to find something that’ll turn the tide in his favor. He seeks, sees, and reaches for his salvation: a tool or a weapon, like a gun, magic book, or lightsaber.

Will our hero reach it first, or will the enemy? We in the audience, like extras in the story, hold our breath because the story’s society is controlled not by desires, opinions, or rules, but by which character holds the tools. The wielder is the victor. The victor writes the rules. It’s the lesson that we the people need to learn for ourselves. It’s the only way we’ll stop being extras and start being player-god protagonists inside a Digital Age civilization.

## A New Empowering Philosophy Called Techvolution

The rules of society surround us every day. We think they control us. They don’t. I’ll show you why.

Talk to any political junkie, no matter when, and they’ll say there’s a big election coming up. They’ll say something like "if the red team wins this one, then education, healthcare, infrastructure, and everything else will go to shit". What he means is elections decide the rule makers, and that blue rules are good while red rules are evil.

If you buy it—and most of us have at some point—you watch blue cable news, read blue blogs, listen to blue talk radio. You fill your head with blue’s philosophy. Soon enough, your car has blue bumper stickers, and you’re waving blue bristol boards while screaming blue chants at rallies, marches, and protests. You feel like a hero! You’re fighting against the evil red philosophy!... Or, if you got sucked in by the other side, evil blue philosophy!

Let me ask you this: if you’re a regular middle-class person and you ignored the election, how much would you bet that you would know who won just by continuing to live your life?

When Team Blue wins, does traffic suddenly disappear? When Team Red wins, does everyone suddenly exercise? Do you breathe fresher air or see fitter neighbors? Do your real-life problems get solved when one color’s philosophy writes the rules?

If you think regulations, laws, and marches change the world, and if you’re dead-set on the red vs. blue storyline because you know it decides the future of our society, may I ask, what problems have red/blue solved to deserve your loyalty? Why are the party platforms from 1984 the same as the ones from 2020?

If you are still loyal to red or blue then you can stop reading now. There’s lots of pundits, columnists, and commentators waiting to sing to their choir, telling you to stay an extra of the Industrial Age, listen to other people's commands, and fight "the enemy" until you’re literally blue in the face.

If you don’t like the choir, or you’re starting to realize the "other side" consists of workers like you who are a part of the same struggling middle class, you’d probably like to keep reading. I wrote this book to make you a force in politics; a protagonist who fights for the Digital Age.

The first thing to realize is whichever colour wins an election this year or the next and re-writes the rules, regular people will still pay taxes, have a huge mortgage, waste hours in traffic, pay increasing energy bills, sleep less than they’re supposed to, buy unhealthy food, watch climate change, overpay for questionable education, get confused by their health insurance, endure customer abuse, work unpaid overtime, get micro-managed by an increasing number of managers, be told by ignorant consultants how to do their work, and hope their job (which they likely hate) isn’t downsized or outsourced.

Under blue or red rules, the struggling middle-class lifestyle stays the same, because the tools with which we live our lives—like suburban homes, gas cars, call centers, centralized power stations, paper-based regulations, mass-produced unhealthy food, movie remakes and sequels, occasional doctor check-ups, television for entertainment, an insatiable education industry, company-controlled work timesheets, and everything else in the pre-digital Woodstock era which built suburban America and Canada—all stay the same.

The rules, no matter the color, don’t control the fate of middle-class people. Our tools determine our way of life. Nothing changes or can change between red and blue, because neither conservatism or progressivism puts new tools into the people’s hands.

It’s not our politicians’ fault. Red and blue philosophies were created at the start of the Industrial Age, when we only had a few tools at hand. Red/blue philosophical fathers like Adam Smith, Edmund Burke, John Stuart Mill, and Karl Marx never had running water, listened to music on the radio, used the internet, made a phone call, opened a fridge, took penicillin, knew about electricity, started a motor, learned about evolution, or typed on a keyboard.

Instead, our red/blue philosophical fathers had mud roads, grandfather clocks, and abacus calculators. Doctors of their time prescribed blood-sucking leeches as a medical cure. Being hungry and sick, cold and ignorant was a daily way of life back then. Red/blue philosophers dreamed of improving this primitive world with better tools. And, truth be told, they did! These philosophies got our ancestors to agree on the same "big picture" and work together in the Industrial Age to build the first rudimentary steam engines, sanitation systems, science labs, telephone networks, broadcast televisions, and computers the size of rooms.

During Industrial Age, the people needed to be extras, regulated and managed inside huge corporations and color-coded parties; someone needed to be on the factory floors and filling the desk jobs using primitive tools to make much better ones. To their credit, the blue and red philosophies at least gave extras a voice in how our tools’ factories, regulations, and profits were controlled.

Today, however, we live inside the world the Industrial Age dreamed to make. The world of mud roads, wood fired stoves, lantern night lights, telegraph communications, horse and carriage transportation, is no more. Now in the Digital Age, we’ve grown a huge ecosystem of cities, factories, offices, telecommunications, and layers of infrastructure. The Industiral Age has done it's job. It’s time for the Digital Age. Which means to de-industrialize, rethink our society’s priorities, and revamp our rulebook to foster more collaboration so we can increases economic prosperity. It's time to transform the extras into protagonist player-gods using the digital tools they worked so hard to create.

We have the tools to jump into the Digital Age now. The iPhones, Tesla Solar Roofs, Lyft, WhatsApp, Kickstarter, YouTube, Snapmaker, Khan Academy, Ruby on Rails, HoloLens, Basecamp, Nano Membrane Toilets, Vimeo, Microsoft AI platform, SquareSpace, Onnit, Airbnb, and Firefox and so many others are all so incredibly versatile, influential, and easy to make that they liberate individuals because they’re customizable to fit every person’s individual needs, enabling each of us to work—like open-source shows possible—far more efficiently, independently, and collaboratively in our home and work lives.

I’m not talking about an idealist, imaginary world envisioned from storybooks. The Digital Age has already started to form. We’ve already seen how worker-to-worker collaboration already exists. We’re living in its midst. Wikipedia, YouTube, Quora, Stack Overflow, VS Code, Firefox, Wikipedia, Common Voice, USB Implementers Forum, GitHub, LibreOffice, and Linux are only a few examples of the wonderful world of cooperation working today. It’s called the open-source community because software and ideas are "openly shared" to help create new tools. Millions of people—creators and contributors, designers and coders—who don’t care about a person’s title but only how well he or she helps the community solve problems both big and small, are already working and living inside a fundamentally new story that’s responsible for our awesome online world. There’s no reason more industries can’t adopt this worker-to-worker collaboration mindset.

Once they do, more workers will become protagonist player-gods again. They'll join the open-source members who hate the "busy work" of aimless marketing meetings, useless PowerPoint presentations about the "garbage problem," and confinements within outdated technology because "that’s what the boss knows". My goal is to help rid our society of Industiral Age philosophies that hold the Digital Age back.

People often say we’re all addicted to our phones. We aren’t. Checking news feeds, downloading augmented reality games, flying drones, and taking endless photos are the acts of regular people learning what their new tools can do. We're preparing ourselves for the Digital Age. Our ancestors did the same the last time they were extras inside a dying Age, learning about printed books, telescopes, and muskets. Those were simply addictive toys until new philosophies turned them into lightsabers that brought down the Medieval Age. Despite the rules, these new tools empowered people to read unknown history, see the universe for themselves, and revolt against royalty as the new tools and new philosophies opened the gates to the ball that turned the people from extras into protagonists player-gods who came together and move civilization forward.

Just so, we can stop using our tools as toys and start wielding them as lightsabers to fight for a better way of life. We’ve just been waiting for a new philosophy to turn them on and bring on the Digital Age. Whatever problem you have, from concerns about online privacy, or hatred ofr our confusing tax code. Industiral Age philosophies only gives us the options to vote for government to regulate a solution, or a business to make a product that we buy and can't control.

Tecvolution says we can make our own product that forces government and businesses to keep up. Firefox is already fighting for online privacy, Ghost is doing it for blogs, Linux for operating systems, and we can do the same thing with any problem we have; once we see realize digital tools are our best weapon to get a better life, and Techvolution, the freedom to use whatever we want, is the most important right and responsibility today. Techvolution is the philosophy that turns a extras into protagonist player-gods who together can win the game of civilization.

## The Power of Philosophies Is Either to Hold Us Back or Push Us Forward

When you look up at the night sky you see a dazzling show. It can seem to defy explanation. But even with the naked eye you’ll see trends. The stars never move, some "objects" (really planets) look to be wandering, and it looks like the Moon, Sun, and everything else revolves around you. With all these trends, our ancestors were so sure Earth was the centre of the Universe it was a pivotal part of the "Divine Rights of Kings" philosophy that ruled Europe, and much of the colonized world, for centuries during the Medievel Age.

When you look at the night sky with a telescope, like Galileo did in the Renaissance, you see it differently. Jupiter has Moons, Venus has phases, and it looks like Earth is just another planet. When Galileo told everyone these facts, the "divine leaders" were threatened. By using a telescope Galileo was basically saying "we don’t know until we test, so let’s use instruments to test what we think we know". Scientific inquiry questioned the ruler’s divine leadership. They thus suppressed Galileo and didn’t facilitate the new truths his new tools were discovering.

Galileo is just one example of how new tools bring on a new technological Age. And of how the people controlling the old philosophy find it very hard to embrace a new Age. The lesson for us is, to make use of new tools and enter into a new Age, we must also embrace a new philosophy.

We already know that we're will into the Digital Age still using a philosophy from the Industrial Age. Here's an example of what that means from daily life. Let's look at space travel. It isn’t just cool, but a major step for humanity that means better satellites, worldwide internet accessibility, and ensuring intelligent life doesn’t put all its eggs in our one earthly basket. All possible if we can build an affordable rocket.

It was private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin (funded by a few rich guys) who answered the call. They even learned to land rockets so they can be reused, a monumental achievement that makes space travel even more possible. But many people, especially red/blue politicians, still didn’t care.

When you’re dependent on old philosophies, you’re also confined to its old tools and live within its old narratives. Today the red/blue philosophy obsesses over minute tax cuts, pages of government regulations, and endless media soundbites because those are the tools their philosophy says are important. New and super-powerful technologies like SpaceX are just a novelty act that fall beyond the practitioners of old philosophies comprehension and comfort zones; like telescopes once were to other political leaders.

That’s the power of a philosophy. It filters the definition of good and bad for its believers. This is just one example. Up and down our economy we use Industrial Age practices when Digital Age ones are far more efficient. Without a new philosophy, we'll never embrace the Digital Age and improve life on, and beyond, Earth.

![old philosophy in a new world](/img\diagrams\techvolution-old-philosophy-new-world.png)
The possibilities of the Digital Age are lost on those obsessed with the old political battles of the Industrial Age. Here’s one example from a personal Twitter feed from December 22 2015 when SpaceX landed its first rocket. At the exact same time red/blue ideologue Bernie Sanders was ranting about regulation battles with Wall Street instead of taking a minute to appreciate all the new solutions SpaceX just opened to humanity. I happened to be following Sanders so I don’t mean to pick on him. The middle-class needs to stop putting their faith in old philosophies and instead follow today’s digital protagonists empowering everyone to be player gods by putting incredible problem-solving tools into all our hands. Like we followed Galileo generations ago.

## Your Place in the Struggle

Fighting to transform society to the possibilities of new tools is a classic human story. It happens everytime we enter into a new technological Age. It happened when Galileo fought a religious establishment with a telescope, George Washington fought a political establishment with a musket, Steve Jobs fought an economic establishment with an iPod.

We can learn from this history lesson. We will empower you with a new philosophy so you too can step up and transform your society into the Digital Age. Note that this is not a book about how to invent tools. Amazing books like Rework and Zero to One already do that. Nor is this a book about the history of invention; The Innovators does that better than I could dream of doing. If you want brilliant critiques of our society, The Incerto and The Great Degeneration are waiting for you. Instead, this is a book about how transforming society into the Digital Age, by putting digital tools into the hands of regular people today.

Today’s philosophies don’t mix well with modern technology. For one they’re happy with old Woodstock era technology. But worse, our outdated philosophies and their supporters don't consider the middle class as equal members of the player-god that's running our society. In red/blue eyes the people are supposed to man and not to command the machines of governments and businesses. Blue/red politics doesn't even notice gatekeepers from the Industrial Age keep adding rules that prevent the people using new digital tools to solve our problems at home and at work. This is the equivalent of Blockbuster getting to write rules to keep us renting DVDs instead of saving time and money with YouTube and Netflix; basically, the opposite of evolution.

We fight back by pushing ourselves into the Digital Age with a new ruling philosophy that fosters our evolution.  Techvolution is thus inspired by Nature. Notice that gatekeepers don’t exist in our world’s ecosystems. Evolution doesn’t have anyone telling a cheetah she’s running too fast, that the ants are too cooperative, or that a camel is too water-efficient for his own good. Individual lifeforms adapt as best they can to their own problems, and the winners survive. There are no middlemen and no gatekeepers, just problem solvers. And the problem solvers live on.

Human biological adaptions take so long, however, that ours have effectively stopped. We’ll never biologically evolve to fly, do advanced calculations, or breathe Martian air. Humanity continues life’s evolution with tools. We’re basically cyborgs who adapt by upgrading our tools to the latest problem in transportation, calculation, and breathing. Hold a spear or a gun, an abacus or a calculator, a plane joystick or a space ship joystick, and you’re a different and more powerful cyborg each time.

Nonetheless, our problem solving is held back when philosophies of an old Age empower gatekeepers to hold back civilization's upgrades. Our civilization's politics is a battle to control the power of new tools; a recurring story of inventors and gatekeepers reaching for the tools to either maintain or bust open gates. The extras look on, trying to see through the rules of an aged ruling philosophy to help the heroes evolve humanity into the new Age.

This classic battle between establishment and innovators fills human stories grom ancient Greek mythology to Shakespeare. Today the most popular story is Star Wars—so I use it in this book. Star Wars is about a galaxy with an all-powerful energy field called the Force. Luke Skywalker’s Jedi warriors’ harness "the light side" to help others. Darth Vader’s evil Sith lords’ harness "the dark side" to help themselves and hurt all who oppose them.

In our world, we like to call our technological protagonists "trailblazers". Like Jedi knights, they struggle to empower us cyborgs with new tools. But we don’t have a political name for the antagonists. Gatekeepers are often bad, but sometimes gates are good, and often these people are just doing their job. Thus, I collectively call the antagonists to our technological evolution Darth Blockbuster: people who actively and knowingly prevent human evolution for the sake of their self-interest.

Since biological adaptions and upgrades are evolution, I’ve called human technological evolution Techvolution. This book is about inventing Techvolution, a new philosophy for the Digital Age to rewrite the rules of society and kill Darth Blockbuster. With Techvolution as a ruling philosophy regular people are empowered to solve problems with technological upgrades as smoothly in human society as lifeforms do with adaptation and natural selection.

To make Techvolution a reality, you, the current middle-class extra, must join the fight raging in our civilization. Right now, open-source inventors are pushing us into the Digital Age and Industrial Age delegators are holding us back. Human evolution depends on you picking between an old ruling philosophy filled with regulations, infotainment, and other reasons to keep your frontline problems alive, and this new one that says you should step up, use digital tools to solve your own problems, and became a hero of our civilization's player-god. And I really do pray you pick the right side.

## Cast of Ideas and Characters

Before we go any further, I want to lay out the philosophy of Techvolution more clearly. To do so, here are a few terms that will put us all on the same page:

===

**Player-god:** Imagine a person playing a computer Civilization game with our society and deciding where to put roads or how much to fund cancer research. Of course there is no such player. In reality it's the choices of individuals that together decide what the community does. The player-god is thus the collective consciousness of society.

**Philosophy:** The largely unspoken ideals that tell individuals what’s right and wrong, good and bad, in science, art, morals, politics, and economics. Philosophy is supposed to unite individuals to see the big-picture; that everyone's choices matter, because everyone is a player-god.

**Ruling philosophy**: A civilization’s chosen philosophy. One that all factions agree on. Examples include the "Divine Rights of Kings," derived from Christian theology and used in royalist Europe; "Marxist-Leninism" of the Soviet Union; and the combination of "red/blue" philosophies of the Western world today.

**Rule book**: The written and unwritten social, workplace, and legal rules that govern everyday life. The rule book is interpreted from the ruling philosophy.

**Technology:** A catchall term for things we make tools from, like concrete, lumber, nails, shingles, insulation, and bricks.

**Tool**: A catchall term for things we create with technology to solve a problem, like guns to kill bad guys, books to record and pass on knowledge, and houses to shelter in.

**Frontline:** The point of contact between a tool and the problem. Nurses giving vaccines, cleaners cleaning a city bus, and soldiers on the battlefield are all examples of frontline settings. People on the frontline have jobs to solve specific problems with a demonstrable skillset.

**Hierarchy**: A power structure that manages every tool’s use by society. Kings and queens with the keys to the castle, for example. Hierarchy’s grow larger the more important a tool gets. The bigger the hierarchy gets, the more detached it gets from the frontline. People in the hierarchy have titles like prince and executive, baron and supervisor to mark their position—and, in a sense, their territory and "rights"—in the power structure.

**The story of civilization**: The invention of new technology and the creation of new tools to overcome the most recent frontline problems. Civilization develops in Ages; as new tools are adopted, they topple the hierarchies huddled around the old tools of the prior Age. We use tools to evolve.

**Protagonists**: People who invent, spread, and use new technology and new tools for the greater good. Usually close to the problems on the frontline, they individually struggle, but their continued self-sacrifice slowly and collectively improves life on Earth. I call them this world’s Jedi knights. We call their leaders trailblazers who often skirt the rules; Galileo, Nikola Tesla, Jay Last, Michael S. Hart, Steve Jobs, Linus Torvalds, and Elon Musk are among their number.

**Antagonists**: People who selfishly resist new tools in order to defend their wealth, power, and prestige atop a hierarchy. Antagonists usually manage companies or institutions based on dated technologies and think that working on the frontline is beneath them. They work to control the rule book so they can hide behind it. We don’t often individually identify them. I coined the term "Darth Blockbuster" so we can.

**Extras**: Everybody in the middle of a battle between antagonists and protagonists. Because they have no direct loyalty to either side or their tools, extras can pick winners and losers. Usually extras are in the middle class; not so poor as to be desperate, but not so powerful that they want to keep the world the same. Sadly, extras don’t realize their power.

**The Death Star**: The rule book when it’s controlled by Darth Blockbuster. Today it exists inside countless regulations, agreements, contracts, laws, and manuals that prevent new tools being used by people.

**Techvolution**: A new philosophy empowering seamless human technological evolution by ridding Darth Blockbuster of his power, by giving extras the right to decide when society should upgrade our tools.

**The Life Star**: A rule book based on Techvolution, governed by human technological adaption and natural selection that makes sure humanity always serve the greater good. We’ll find out how it works throughout this book.

**Plot**: Getting the extras to step up, replace their ruling philosophy, and establish the Digital Age.

## Nice to Meet You, Stargazer

You might be an open-source protagonist, or an extra looking for work, either way I’m calling you Stargazer. It’s a name in honor our ancestors like Copernicus, Galileo, and Friar Bruno who toppled the Medieval Age because they looked up at the night sky. Their sense of wonder, made them ask questions, and answering those questions brought on the Scientitic Age that improve all our lives.

Whoever you are Stargazer, you need to know that the story to advance human technological evolution into the Digital Age can only begin with you. You won’t be transported to a foreign city, mythical world, or a galaxy far, far away. Right here and now, wherever you are on Earth—that’s exactly where you need to be. The time has come to change our ruling philosophy to take advantage of digital tools.

And who am I to tell you all this? I’m nobody special. I haven’t led the country and you haven’t seen me on the news. In my youth, I was a cleaner, labourer, movie usher/projectionist, and die-hard ideologue. After dropping the latter bad habit, I studied political philosophy, history, and innovation at the University of Toronto, usually while working full-time. I have a strong dislike for garbage meetings and other excuses people make-up to avoid work. I hate people with superiority complexes; especially when they’re in positions of authority and suck at their jobs. That’s why I learned far more about innovation by continuing working at the frontline as a line worker, an account manager, and a claims adjuster. Making a new tool and meeting my personal Darth Blockbuster was an education unto itself.

My life’s experience began to teach me Techvolution. Watching the middle-class struggle to make a living owning, maintaining, and working with outdated Woodstock era tools—and knowing that the open-source community was meanwhile showing us a different way, a better and more liberating way—ultimately motivated me to sit at the keyboard and uncover the political philosophy of the Digital Age that will could connect the people with amazingly empowering digital tools that will improve all our lives.

But this book is not about me. It’s about you. You are in a position where you wield a diversity of incredible and cutting-edge tools, even if you’re unaware of it right now. From hospital cleaners to internet technical support, from engineers to claims adjusters, the bottom line is that you are at the frontline. Only workers on the frontline know firsthand the exact tools our society needs to keep us healthy and evolving in the Digital Age. The daily pain of real work makes you powerful. A piece of knowledge Darth Blockbuster will never have.

That’s why you Stargazer, if you want it, you are the hero of Techvolution. Don’t be surprised. Average Joes and Janes are always the heroes. Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Neo, and Cinderella were all regular people. Heroes aren’t born. They’re stargazers, dreamers, believers, and achievers. They become heroes when they step up to defeat the bad guys.

History is calling someone to step up now. Climate change, polluted oceans, individual isolation, traffic jammed roads, mass extinctions, exported manufacturing, rampant self-entitlement, massive government debt, decaying infrastructure, domestic terrorism, fractured national identities, low trust in institutions, and other structural problems will only get passed on to our kids unless the middle-class steps up now to establish the Digital Age. No lifeform can survive a dying ecosystem. If you don't step-up, you're only hoping to get lucky.

Always remember you are not alone. There are many like you, bands of regular people on the frontline with shaky employment or soul-crushing commutes, who need to, and are ready to, become player-gods again and improve their society’s health. I’m like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Morpheus, or the fairy godmother; merely a guide to teach you how to defeat the villains. So, the time is now, Stargazer, to leave the farm and join the rebellion.

The rebellion I speak of might be different than what automatically comes to mind. It is not a physical revolt. It does not involve rallies, marches, or protests. It’s a rebellion of the mind. The Digital Age is held back by Darth Blockbuster and his Death Star rule book stagnate our evolution by retaining old tools and preventing us from using new ones to solve frontline problems efficiently and effectively. We must defy him and destroy it. We must change our ruling philosophy. Only when Darth Blockbuster is gone will the Digital Age come and the middle class flourish once again.

## Heroes Reach for the Tools

We've come some way in the story Stargazer. Let's take a minute and answer some questions you might be thinking.

First off, a new Age, and a ruling philosophy doesn't mean you throw away all the old stuff. Old philosophies, red/blue among them, will always teach us lessons, help us do our jobs better, and enlighten our personal opinions. Today old philosophies should not be our ruling philosophy because they weren't created with digital tools in mind.

Techvolution is. It's designed to make the best use of digital tools. Let me explain how Techvolution can be our ruling political philosophy by discussing evolution in martial arts.

Humanity has many martial arts: karate, kickboxing, wrestling, jiu-jitsu, judo, and boxing being among the most popular. Each martial art adapts the human body to do specific technique like punches or choke-holds. Each martial art also makes rules, so only their chosen techniques are allowed during competition; there's no kicking in a boxing match, for example.

In the early 1990s, the martial arts community got curious and wondered whose martial art would win a real fight. On reflection, it seems funny that this was an original idea, but before the 1990s, people just assumed boxers or wrestlers could not fight outside their rulebook. All fighters were supposed to be ideologically loyal and sing to their choirs about their techniques being the best. If a fighter got their ass kicked in a real fight, they'd often blame themselves or say the other guy "broke the rules" and "cheated".

When the martial art community threw away their rule books and held "no rules" tournaments, they were fittingly rewarded with Nature's officially best martial art. The best martial art was none of them; or all of them. The best fighters trained all techniques and used the ones they thought would defeat their opponent based on the exact moment they were fighting them. A large toolbox of techniques and an open mind to adapt proved to be the best martial art. Fighters embracing adaption and natural selection was the start of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA), a new sport that cherishes the evolution mantra "admit defeat and learn". And while boxers still punch the best, and kickboxers kick the best, evolution powered MMA fighters will almost always beat them in a street fight.

Red/blue ideologies are like non-MMA martial arts. They teach a limited number of techniques, limit themselves to their own rule book, and often think "the other side" is ignorant. Ideologues often accuse non-believers of cheating after losing a debate or election. However, in their area of expertise, from monetary policy to farm regulation, red/blue have a massive reservoir of know-how. This single book can't replace all that knowledge. It would be laughable to suggest it could.

But we still need a new ruling philosophy. One created from the lessons of evolution and digital tools old philosophies did not factor in simply because they're so old. Hence why this book is about making human technological evolution, Techvolution, the most protected political right (and responsibility) today. There's no other way to enter into the Digital Age.

You can think of Techvolution as "mixed philosophy politics". Under Techvolution, a person is free to study and believe in old philosophies. But no one should think the rule books of old philosophies determine right and wrong when up against a person's right to evolve on the frontline. Because to evolve humanity, we the people on the frontline—the people in the real fight—need the freedom to decide which tool best solves a problem. The right to evolve must trump all other considerations. Giving old philosophies, or people whose power and prestige is based on old tools, the right to decide human technological upgrades is a recipe for staying in the Industiral Age forever. This set-up is basically why the middle-class is getting beat up by relatively simple problems like road traffic, waiting on hold, and confusing loan contracts.

Importantly, since Techvolution is a vital right of the Digital Age, it must also be a responsibility. Here are some tools the middle-class should grab hold of today.

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation recently funded TerraPower, a new nuclear reactor fueled by depleted uranium. Among many other reasons, because they could use supercomputers to design it, TerraPower made nuclear power much safer. Bill and Melinda hope dozens of their reactors will keep the world's lights on for generations—but even they can't afford to buy them. Should we tell our governments too? I don't know, I'm no expert. But nuclear power is clean, and continuing to breath in smog and ejecting greenhouse gases into the air is hardly a good thing. Also considering that electricity powers all digital tools. And some of our wealthiest and smartest people think TerraPower is a good idea. we should should all think about funding TerraPower out of pure evolutionary self-interest.

3D printers are like inkjet printers, except they fuse particles together and thus can print 3D objects, even ones as complicated as a violin. They're very common in industrial prototyping. Regular people could use them to print lost buttons, toy action figures imagined by kids, or custom-designed garden tools. The best part of 3D printers is there's no factories, cargo ships, tractor-trailers, marketing campaigns, or retail stores needed. Anyone can print whatever they need, whenever they need it. Sadly, most people have never even seen a 3D printer never-mind bought one of its printed products. It's a shame we should fix quickly.

I didn't draw any of this book's illustrations. I've also never met the artists who did or even spoken with them. Instead I used paint.net to edit photos and put them together in design software called Figma. Then I found illustrators via online marketplaces and said: "please draw me this". Within days I had the illustrations I needed. Today anyone can work with experts to write computer code, make a gift, or design a custom 3D printed construction tool. All with no job interviews, management oversight, or upfront cost. Online worker-to-worker collaboration is that easy; once we think to look for it.

As said before, the Woodstock era is a dead. But we keep trying to keep it alive. We've exported the millions of skilled jobs to fund it, distracted ourselves from that stupidity by borrowing money to buy every flashy homes, cars, and TVs. The expectation that middle-class people will get one job for life and safely assume "the government" or "the market" will solve all our problems does nothing but give false hope of a "forever Woodstock lifestyle". And think of this, about 80,000 people worked at Blockbuster, about 5,000 work for Netflix. Why would that automation trend stop for your industry?

In my experience, many people often reply "won't happen to my job"; then go back to watching Netflix.

Digital tools don't threaten us. They're our salvation. If we use them we can educate ourselves, lower our own cost of living, earn our own income, and most important, collaborate. Can we become entirely self-sufficient? Probably not, but we can deal with layoffs, price-gouging, and bad jobs better with a level balance of power.

Keep in mind, all the examples of digital tools in this book are just a snippet. There are many more out there, and once the open-source Jedi finally get our support, we'll be spoiled for choices. And regular people wanting to use digital tools is the rebellion inside our mind we need to establish the Digital Age.

In short, Techvolution says, be selfish! Demand your freedom! Freedom to speak our minds made the most of the printing press. Freedom to investigate Nature made the most of scientific instruments. Freedom to question royalty made the most of the gun. Freedom to buy products made the most of factories. And the freedom to solve your own real-life problems makes the most of digital tools.

Techvolution starts in your head. While you're watching a political debate, or attending a company meeting, ask yourself, "what's in this for me". Of course, red/blue politicians won't talk about a direct democracy app, and I don't want you to tell your boss to go to hell and quit your job. But a new technological Age first changes in your mind. As you keep asking "what's in this for me," you'll seek out new digital tools. When you hold new tools, you hold political power. And holding power is how extras become protagonists.

That's why controlling tools is the Nature of all political battles. Whether in galaxies far far away, street fights in parking lots, wars between nations, or your own life. It's why antagonists make new tools against the rules. And why I needed to write a book to remind everyone rules are supposed to serve human evolution, not get in its way. But since today the rules are in the way of the Digital Age Stargazer, we must pack our bags, rally our friends, and get ready for a fight. It's time to blow up a Death Star.
