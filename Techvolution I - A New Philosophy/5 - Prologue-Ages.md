How do we develop through technological Ages? Going from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age or the Medieval Age to Scientific Age happens over generations—it's hard to get our head around. I've been thinking about it for years and only now have a grasp. There's a lot to think about when a civilization's entire way of life upgrades to new technology.

Play games like Age of Empires, Anno 1800, and Civilization and you’ll get a good idea of how it works. You’ll be the player “god” that saves up the resources, invests in the science, and decides when to click “upgrade”. Then, like magic, civilization instantly transforms. Every house, factory, building, road, library, school is suddenly new and improved.

The above is just a game of course. But we're in there somewhere, looking up from Main St. trying to figure out how to earn a living while society transforms around us. It's hard—there is no player god and no magic button. Instead, we, the people inside the game, must collect the resources, do the research, and manually upgrade every part of our civilization bit by bit—with blood, sweat, and tears. We can't sit back, click, and watch.  We must live it.

The story of civilization has many ups and downs. Society often has one foot in the old era and one foot in the new. And this is the world of politics and philosophy, civil wars and revolutions I want to explain to you. Because in 1970 we entered the Digital Age. Since then digital innovators, geeks, and hackers have been upgrading our society with digital tools—while the powers that be have been holding them back.

And that’s the reason the life of the middle-class has gotten worse. Things will only improve once we finish the Digital Age upgrade. There's no game, cheats, or gimmicks. There’s just you, and your friends, that have to get out the sweat-bands, work gloves, and new ideas to upgrade every piece of our civilization, bit by bit.

The job before us is as natural as evolution. New and improved lifeforms always fight to replace the old ones; its how life adapts. Likewise, right now our civilization is moving from the Industrial Age to the Digital Age. You can only help it along, or old it back.

This book is your guide. It integrates technology, history, politics, and philosophy; but it's not written for any buff. It uses the power of stories to help the people inside the game—today's middle-class—who want to see their better life now. The first step is a new mindset. Because we already have digital tools. We only need a new philosophy to enjoy all the wonders of the Digital Age.
