# You Could Be So Much Happier Right Now

We're in a pandemic. People are shocked, scared, and quite unhappy. It's like watching a story, except we're the ones standing by waiting to see what's going to happen next. But this is isn't fiction. It's real-life, and it could have been so much easier.

2020 could have just as easily been a massive war or natural disaster. There are lots of ways our way of life can be disturbed; because it's so easy to disrupt. Our lives are based around centralizing resources. China makes stuff, America consumes it, is the general idea. The thinking goes, by encouraging regions to specialize in manufacturing as few products or services as possible, we can maximize production. Free-trade and international corporations put this philosophy into practice.

That's the Industrialization Age mentality. And it makes us very fragile to any sort of disturbance. Like the butterfly effect, any problem ripples throughout the world. If we were an animal, it would be like we had no genetic diversity. Like the replicating marbled crayfish, any problem spreads contagion throughout our species.

2020 could have been so much easier because, since 1970, we've been in the Internet Age. The greatness of digital tools isn't Instagram models, or YouTube distracts. It's giving us the ability to diversify ourselves so that contagion can't spread like wildfire. The Internet Age lets us build a new antifragile way of life.

The internet is a distributed communications network, which means there is no central authority. With the internet, our lives can be distributed. Think of all those office workers who commute hours into work every day. If they had "work from home" rights, they'd be far more relaxed right now. And imagine that instead of diamond rings and flashy cars, Tesla Solar Roofs, we're the cool thing to buy. Working from home with your own electricity means pandemics have to fight so much harder to get around.

We're edging closer to it every day. I call it the era of mass-collaboration. Where individuals have the right, freedom, and responsibility, to evolve more antifragile ways to live. But there's much antagonism to it. The people who benefit most from the Industrial Age don't want to see their time in the sun fade away. When I tried to introduce a new product to help distribute power to individuals over this hierarchy, it was like fighting Darth Vader.

And, these small group of antagonists controls our society's rulebook today. A fragile way of life makes us unhappy in our daily lives but terrified when hitting a pandemic. Feeling the pain of disease, war, and death is how Nature teaches lifeforms to learn; it's the story of life. But humanity can live it as a game because we learn from our mistakes and plan ahead. If we make a new rulebook and believe in modern philosophy.

We're not in a story. We're in a game, and we just lost a turn. If you want to learn how we can go back to winning read Techvolution. It's a new philosophy that's designed to make us antifragile and thus happier. Especially at times like today.
