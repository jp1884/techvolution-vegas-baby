# Prologue

Hush-A-Phone v. United States, 238 F.2d 266 (D.C. Cir. 1956) was a seminal ruling in United States telecommunications law decided by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Hush-A-Phone Corporation marketed a small, cup-like device which mounted on the speaking party's microphone, reducing the risk of conversations being overheard and increasing sound fidelity for the listening party. At the time, AT&T had a near monopoly on America's phone system and even controlled the equipment that attached to its network. In this era, Americans had to either lease, or use approved equipment, when attaching anything to their phone line. Hush-A-Phone had been around for 20 years without any issues, but when a AT&T lawyer saw one in a store window, the company decided to sue on the grounds anything attached to a phone could damage its network[1].

AT&T, citing the Communications Act of 1934, which stated in part that the company had the right to make charges and dictate "the classifications, practices, and regulations affecting such charges," claimed the right to "forbid attachment to the telephone of any device 'not furnished by the telephone company.'"

Initially, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruled in AT&T's favor; it found that the device was a "foreign attachment" subject to AT&T control and that unrestricted use of the device could, in the commission's opinion, result in a general deterioration of the quality of telephone service.[2]



A federal appeals court dismissed the AT&Tâ€™s claim. The court's decision, which exonerated Hush-A-Phone and prohibited further interference by AT&T toward Hush-A-Phone users, stated that AT&T's prohibition of the device was not "just, fair, and reasonable," as required under the Communications Act of 1934, as the device "does not physically impair any of the facilities of the telephone companies," nor did it "affect more than the conversation of the user."

This victory for Hush-A-Phone was widely considered a watershed moment in the development of a secondary market for terminal equipment, in addition to contributing to the breakup of the Bell System. It was still illegal to connect some equipment to the AT&T phone network, For example, moderms counld not be connecting electronically, users had to thus make a connection mechanically by,by connecting a phone receiver to an acoustic coupler via suction cups[3].

Regardless, and despite lobbying from AT&T afterwardwards, further barriers to using its phone network began to crumble. The Hush-A-Phone case, and the related Carterfone decision, were seen as precursors to the entry of MCI Communications and the development of more pervasive telecom competition.
