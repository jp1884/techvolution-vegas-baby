# You Could Be So Much Happier Right Now

We're in a pandemic. People are shocked, scared, and quite unhappy. It's like watching a story waiting to see what's going to happen next. But this is isn't fiction. It's real-life. And it could have been so much easier.

2020 could have just as easily been a massive war or natural disaster. There are lots of ways our way of life can be disturbed because it's so easy to disrupt. Our lives are based around the Industrial Age mentality of centralizing resources. China makes stuff, America consumes it, is the general idea. The thinking goes, by encouraging regions to specialize in creating as few products or services as possible, we can maximize production. We've been using free-trade and international business put this philosophy into practice for generations.

This era of mass-production mentality makes us very fragile to any sort of disturbance. For example, 16 critical medications are only made in China. 80% of IV bags are made in Puerto Rico. While mass-production works great in good times, like the butterfly effect, any problem ripples throughout the world. If we were an animal, it would be like we had no genetic diversity. Like the marbled crayfish that replicates itself instead of mates, any problem spreads contagion throughout our entire species.

2020 could have been so much easier because, since 1970, we've been in the Internet Age. The greatness of digital tools isn't Instagram models, or YouTube distracts. It's giving us the ability to diversify ourselves so that disasters are contained within their ecosystems. The Internet Age lets us build a new antifragile way of life, so that we can offer help across economies when one is savaged by an inevitable problem.

With the internet, our ways of life can be more independent instead of inter-dependent. With less centralization, and more diversification, our supply lines, ways of life become less efficient in the short term. But if we want our civilization, it makes more sense to think of the long term when disasters, famines, wars, are inevitable. A regional supply chain, with many people working from home with your own electricity means pandemics have to fight so much harder to get around.

We're edging closer to it every day. I call it the era of mass-collaboration. Where individuals have the right, freedom, and responsibility, to evolve more antifragile ways to live. But there's much antagonism to it. The people who benefit most from the Industrial Age want the world be stay one ecosystem. When I tried to introduce a new product to help distribute power to individuals over this hierarchy, it was like fighting Darth Vader.

And, these small group of antagonists controls our society's rulebook. Their enforced fragile way of life makes us unhappy in our daily lives but terrified when hitting a pandemic. Feeling the pain of disease, war, and death is however what Nature uses to teach its lifeforms to learn; it's the story of life. But humanity can live it as a game because we learn from our mistakes and plan ahead. We can do it today, if we believe in modern philosophy.

We're not in a story. We're in a game, and we just lost a turn. If you want to learn how we can go back to winning read Techvolution. It's a new philosophy that's designed to make us antifragile and thus much happier. Especially at times like today.

- This pandemic is an inevitable evolutionary challenge. And, evolution doesn't have to be a story we watch and suffer through. It can be a game we master and enjoy.
