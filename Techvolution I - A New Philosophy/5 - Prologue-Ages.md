## Evolution Needs a Choice

Do you believe in Techvolution? Do you think Right/Left philosophy is outdated? Do you see why the era of mass-production should be replaced by mass-collaboration? Do you want to hold levers of power in your society, instead of complaining, protestig, and begging the powerbrokers for help. Do you see through the endless rules of the Industrial Age as bullshit. Can you see the dark majic around gas cars, 9-5 workdays, call-centres, paper-forms—the entire 1969 way of life that keeps us away from the Internet Age?

That fate of civilization is on your shoulders. Your job is to do what's best for yourself, and help society prosper. Looking up for guidance you now see two options. Open-source heroes of the Internet Age who keep innovating, thinking ahead, while fiiling the world with the majic of evolution. And the self-importance, short-sightedness of Darth Blockbuster, the fallen hero of the Industrial Age who uses the trickery of dark majic and a corrupted rulebook to keep himself in power.

You an internet cyborg, inside the Industrial Age philosophy. The only question is, what philosophy do you believe in? Deciding the ruling philosophy is your Main Street's power. It's a battle as old as civilization between Protagonist vs. Antagonist. Inventor vs. Noble. And now Player God vs. Extra.

The fate of civilization is a simple question. Who are you Stargazer? Will you be a player god or an extra? We all await your choice. The conclusion of Techvolution: A New Philosophy is thus a simple discussion inside your head. Which might look something like this.

## Dialogues in Your Head

INT: HIGH-SCHOOL GYM - DAY

Some high-school seniors sit stand against the wall, or sit on bences. Most sit cross-legged on the gym floor trying to pay attention to the presentation. On stage is an annual event in every Western country. What should these kids do after high-school graduation 2002. On stage is the Principle, yammering on and on and about their options.

Stargazer sits and watches. But hears something different. He filters the options now as Jedi Open-Source, plainly dressed with a squiky voice, and Darth Blockbuster in a tailored suit and with excellent presentation skills. The voices of Player god and Extra battle each other, for Stargazer's soul.

OS: You're important! This Sith Lord is holding you back. It's just...
DB: Why not put more pressure on the young kids shoulders. Go to college. Everyone does it. You'll get a degree, and thereafter respect of everyone you'll ever meet. Everyone will see you as a college graduate. You'll get in, adn be taken car of.
OS: Then why do you charge $20,000 a year, with no guarantees!
DB: Tell us who will care about demonstrable skills? Welders, seamstresses, even coders, all those jobs are gone buddy.
OS: Because you export them you asshole! On the internet you can learn and do whatever you want, just go out and do it.
DB: Does that sound right to you? Is that what you'll put on the resume?
OS: Sell shoes, pens, books on the internet. Cut out this useless middle-man!

Extra: This is so easy.
Player god: Darth only wants us to join college, because it validates his degree. Jedi just wants us to be educated.
Extra: Do we really want to go out in the world, with only "Internet Education" beside our name. HR reps will glaze over our applications.
Player god: That's because they're just like Darth.
Extra: They're still the ones with the money.
Player god: Fuck.

OS: Look at me Darth. I'll get you.
DB: Go back in your garage and "change the world".

The Principle continues his presentation, and Stargazer goes to college.

EXT: PATIO, STARBUCKS - DAY

It's 2007 now. Stargazer is sipping a fair trade coffee, and tweaking that resume on the laptop. It's light on the work experience, but heavy on the marches, social clubs, and "co-ops". But it says College Graduate on it.

OS: $80,000 in debt. Great way to foster the young.
DB: You change the world yet?
OS: Ever since 1970.
DB: You've been selling this bullshit that long.
OS: You've been stealing my work that long. Using it to over produce you're consumer bullshit, export Main Street, and pay yourself those bonuses.
DB: All approved by regulations and/or laws.

Player god: Of course it was. You paid to change them. And Bezos sold books on the internet and now look at him.
Extra: How many aren't him. Still in fucking garages. And look at us, we're graduates now!
Player god: Filling out coffee shop applications with 500 a month debt payment.
Extra: We're at Starbucks. You start low, work you're way up. And we can afford 500 a month.

OS: Lying scumback. The kid doesn't even know 500 doesn't even pay down the principle! 20 years of schooling and that's not taught. But I bet the kid feels guilty about some social justice bullshit that happened 500 years ago.
DB: Back to the garage. I'm the winner. I increased our country's wealth by trillions of dollars. You're all lucky with how much trickles down.

OS seethes, as Stargazer puts away the laptop, puts on an apron, and returns working the counter at a coffee shop, talking with co-workers, each of which is in about the same boat.

EXT: HOTEL CONVENTION CENTRE - DAY

Now it's 2008. The housing crisis. Office people mingle. Wearing suits and ties in a crowd 500 plus strong.

Extra: I told you. We made it. Regional Supervisor.
Player god: We answer phone calls, but granted the pay is okay.

The crowd starts moving into the convention centre that has two huge rooms. One is marked A, the other B. Tables full of HR reps sit with lists of employee names. As employees approach the table, they're assigned an A, or B.

Extra: What the fuck is this?
Player god: Mass firing. Now whose talking about chances?

## The End, or the Beginning

I'm going to stop there. I've run out of time. More importantly, I can't think for you. Nor do I want to keep holding your hand. That hand is free to hold whatever tool it wants, and evolve humanity if it can. This book has been informative enough. You understand that when our hands drop old tools, and pick up new ones, regular people control the levers of power. But to pull those levers, we need a new philosophy that turns us into player gods of the game.

So, the future is on your shoulders. Antagonists will never stop. Open-source protagonists have done their job. I personally just want to live in a place were life prospers. That's why I pray you decide to play the game, like our ancestors did for us so many times.

The solution to our unhappiness is upgrading to the Internet Age and embracing the era of mass-collaboration. To do that, we need Techvolution, a new philosophy that gives the right, and duty, to frontline people to use digital tools to solve their real-life problems. Letting antagonists decide is stupid, while believing in Left/Right philosophies is a recipe for living in the past.

Look around, and see old drafty windows, gas engine car, cable news, mass-producted toys, eight different bosses, car traffic, endless red-tape... Do you see the Industrial Age? Are you willing to overcome dark majic and drop old tools and become a proud Internet Age cyborg who solves todays frontline problems?

Or do you want to return to the comfort and safety of being a 1969 cyborg, bragging about gas cars, fake job titles, and McMansions, while following the antagonists rules, and chasing the phantoms of Conservative/Progressive politics. Did Techvolution click? The fate of your life, your kids, and of your society, rests on the simple question—will you step up and become a player god in the game of civlization?

If you do, we win. If you don't, we lose.
