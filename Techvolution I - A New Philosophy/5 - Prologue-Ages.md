# Look Up

Look up. Whereever you are, look up. Do you see the "mythical player god"? No you don't, and never will. You are that player, you're choices determine what happens in the game. If you eat a salad over a cheesesteak, that means health statistics get better. If you walk to the store instead of drive, road traffic gets better. If you read instead of binge watch, education gets better.

You are the lifeform playing the game of civilization. And doing the typical thing is losing us the game. Reaching for the fancy car, bigger home, more expensive schooling is not, and will not, bring us victory. You car is causing climate change. Your home is a money pit causing financial crises, your schooling is paying for overly common prestige. Furthermore, getting the 9-5 job, obeying your boss, buying retirement funds, isn't enough. That is Industrial Age thinking. We can't live in Boston, move to Miami, and expect to live the same Woodstock, Leave It to Beaver, suburban way of life.

We are in a new age. Which means our habitat has changed. You, me, everyone has to adapt in the exact same way a polar bear would have to adapt in the Amazon. We have to question our physiology of tools, and find which new ones helps us improve the statistics in the game. Sealing drafty windows, biking to the store, re-connecting with a lonely friend.

That's what Techvolution is. The self-awareness that we are the mythical player god. It's there our right, and duty, to do whatever we must to win the game. You don't have to change the entire world. You only have to do what you can, to improve your slice of it. And the compass that shows you the way, is your own happiness.
