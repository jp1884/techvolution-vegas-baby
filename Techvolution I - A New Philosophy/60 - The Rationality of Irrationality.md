# The Rationality of Irrationality, and Walking on Eggshells

- outsiders have perspection.
- society needs genetic outsiders, who can't accept the rules, because they're irrational
- when society is irrational, individual irrationality is a chance to right the ship.

## The Rationality of Irrationality

The Sun used to rotate the Earth. Every birthday party was a celebration the Sun revolved around you. The Earth was stationary, and the stars, galaxies, and Universe that surround our little solar system was basically a lightshow. That's all we could see with our eyes.

Ancent Greek astronomer and mathematician Aristarchus of Samos (310-230 BC) said otherwise. Among his achivements he correctly figured out the relative sizes of the Moon, Sun, and Earth. Every year a well in Egypt had no shadow. He reasoned the Sun is directly above it. On the same day he measured the shadow the great Tower of Alexandria. He measured the distances and heights of everything, used the pythgorean theorem, and voila, the Sun is 80 times the size of Earth, and the Moon is one forth. Aristarchus thereafter said why would the Sun move if it's so much bigger.

Aristarchus was right, but his argument still lost. If the Earth moved so much, Aristarchus had to explain why the stars don't move positions. He said the stars were other Suns, but just extremely far away. Extremely far away seemed too weird when humanity measued things in feet. So Aristarchus lost out to Aristotle's opinion the Earth was stationary, and the Sun revolved around it.

Most everyone in all cultures and religions agreed. It's a mark of Ancient Greece genius that it thought of both options, made astronmical systems for both, and choose Aristotle because his evidence seemed better. And it wasn't until Issac Newton in 1687 finally settled the debate. Until 1687 it was rational to be wrong.

Thus, when Copernicus rediscovered Aristarchus during the Renaissance around 1514, he started thinking irrationally. It was around the same time Machiavelli told Europe to disregard tradition and find the "effectual truth". Modernity, the line of reasoning from Machiavelli to Rousseau, started by being irrational. Thus even though Copernicus finished a early copy of _On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres_ in 1532, he didn't want to publish it because he feared the scorn "to which he would expose himself on account of the novelty and incomprehensibility of his theses".

Contrary to some opinions, the religiously minded scholars of Europe, going through the wars between Catholics and Protestants, were not immediately hostile to Copernicus. Many were curious. Copernicus had a reputation for intelligence. When he said the Earth moved people were curious. It was fine to even talk about it, and even argue about it. As previously discussed, Europe was just obessesed about preventing political collapse, because even centuries after Rome's collapse, they feared the chaos. So people just couldn't say the Earth moved was the truth. Truth only has one definition, and two definitions starts political collapse.

Copernicus's book was almost pure math. Most people, regardless of social status, couldn't understand it. Thus they were extras in the story of whether the Earth moved or not. The backlash started when rogues brought Copernicus's message to the extras. Because the rationality of the ruling philosophy was questioned. Until Newton, any argument for Earth moving was irrational. Thus, the rogue's had to make irrationality arguments about the truth. The best example of the rationality of irrationality was Friar Bruno (1548-1600).

Bruno's life could fill volumes. He was a protagonist in every sense of the word. He rose above the ruling philosophy of Aristotle and Christian theology. Born in 1548 he became a priest in 1572 and studied theology in a monastary, getting his doctrate in 1575. He was investigated for having controversial theological views (more extremely minor details like thinking Jesus was a being separate from God). He was persecuted and frustrated enough to flee his monastic order in 1576. He was excommunicated and spent the next 16 years travelling western Europe.

Bruno was poor. He worked at a printer, he taught Latin, and did what he needed to make the rent. He taught in University for a few years before Protestants kicked him out. He was a known rebel to everyone still obessesed with the ruling philosophy. That's probably why all three major western religions, Catholics, Calvinsits, and Lutherans, all excommunicated him. Today that would be like the USA, China, and Russia all hating you.

If you met Bruno you'd know why was so hated. He was irrational. That's why he could understand the truth better than almost everyone else. Even more then Copernicus, Bruno imagined the Universe for what it is today. Other stars, with other planets, with other lifeforms. Millions and millions of miles away from Earth. The rational people simply couldn't understand this imagination.

Ever talk to a homeless man? Not the one whose job was outsourced, the the drifter, or the one on drugs. The quiet guy who walks around talking to himself, too obsessed with his own thinking to do much of anything else. He's homeless, but a perfectly nice person content with his own thinking.

So walks around inside the reality only he knows. He loves when anyone agrees with him, but almost nobody can because he can't even describe it. He's perfectly happy inside his own reality.

Until you take him out of that reality. Until you tell him that reality isn't real. That in fact he's living a lie. That he should change. Then you'll see the nice man become a guardian and defend his reality like a parent defending a child. No moderation is possible. Stubborn, asshole, foolish, crazy, many names label that homeless man. It's best to leave the man alone, let him be, and let him live inside his own world.

If you've ever talked to someone like that, if that sounds familiar, then you've talked to Friar Bruno. The difference is Bruno didn't have a unique reality he was happy to live within. He had a unqiue reality he demanded others live in. The Earth moved damn it! The Sun was the center of the Universe! Listen up!

That's why Bruno's life wasn't spent walking around Naples, minding his own business, as another forgotten homeless man. It was spent writing, lecturing, debating everyone and everything in all of western civilization. He pissed off everyone because Bruno argued for the rationality of irrationality.

Because Bruno was a bit off, he could disassociate with the human world, and see the truth modern technology made possible. Bruno had a stream of realizations, a stream of majic in his head. He struggled to explain the rationality to anyone else, because well, it wasn't rational yet.

He was the tip of the spear. The one who bore the burden of being the first to cross the dangerous river. His free mind, which makes many men homeless, made him point to the future. He was rewarded with publications and fame, and punished with scorn and infamy. He never gave up. Many people were his antagonists. Occasionally regular people with their stubborn beliefs, but usually it was high ranking clergy and political leaders who attacked him, usually with dialogue in spoken threats or written condemnations. He was finally burned at the stake.

Bruno story is the same as Socrates, Rousseau, Hobbes, Machiavelli, Copernicus, and so many other protagonists. All of whom questioned the ruling philosophy, threatned the ruling nobility, and pushed the human race forward. They all show the rationality of irrationality. which is otherwise called wonder. And wonder is the tool of the extra. Because anyone can wonder, and once anyone wonders, they open themselves up to new answers.

And today, the extras need to wonder what they see, and will see, in the telescope of digital technology. The lesson is the same for our telescope. The one that will showcase the errors in our ruling philosophy of liberal free-market economics. It will showcase details about our economics that so far are irrational to mention. But who is responsible for climate change? Which individuals fly the most, drive the most, consume the most, that our fucking planet is boiling. Who over claims on insurance. Which communities, which persons take more than they contribute. Who resists accountability that the telescope will reveal to us.

The telescope will show us we need economic ecosystems. We need to create communities, with a strict divide between members and non-members, to force everyone to collaborate to use local resources much more efficiently. We need to create technology, to showecase the effectual truth of all the world's cultures and peoples, in order to give individuals the economic freedom they have in politics.  We must be camels living in the desert, and anacondas in the Amazon.

The self-declared smart will probably never get techvolution. For the same reason why few accepted Copernicus, Bruno, Machiavelli, and the rest. Changing the ruling philosophy makes them stop attending banquets and balls celebrating their nobility and instead get back to work.

The extras in the story of society are the only ones free enough to make themselves into the futures protagonists. And today's extras are the struggling middle class. And the question is, will they. They certainly should. But we only find out if they will in the story's climax.
