Are you happy? On the outside, Westerners have flashy products, full employment, and stable politics. On the inside, our middle-class deals with stagnate wages, crushing debts, antisocial behavior, political hatred, climate change. We have the freedom to vote Left or Right, moderate or extreme. We've tried them all, but none have helped.

I think our unhappiness is a sign of a huge problem. Our ideologies are very outdated. They were created in the Industrial Age, and since 1970, we've been in the Digital Age. Old ideologies are holding us back and causing our dreary lifestyles. We need a new philosophy—one created to harness the remarkable potential of digital tools.

Here it is. Its big lesson is this. The middle-class has to step up and use digital technology to solve our own problems. If we don't, we'll keep suffering the pains of society running on old ideological fumes.

## Dedication

_This book is for the people in the open-source community. For the unspoken philosophy you handed down to me. For selflessly updating Wikipedia, writing free software, and building cool new tech for us all. For being the protagonists of the Digital Age. You gave the best education a political guy can get. I hope I’ve learned enough to write this book._

_For the antagonists, the self-entitled delegators keeping Blockbuster—and it's Industrial Age mentality—alive, thanks for causing history to repeat itself yet again. I hope you learn something._

_This is especially dedicated to the extras. Because when it’s time for you to act, I pray you pick the right side._

## Quote

"_We are really the revolutionaries in the world today—not the kids with long hair and beards who were wrecking the schools a few years ago._"

# Introduction

## Looking Up

How do we develop through technological Ages? Going from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age or the Medieval Age to Scientific Age happens over generations—it can be hard to get our head around. I've been thinking about it for years and only now have a grasp. There's a lot to think about when a civilization's entire way of life upgrades to new technology.

Play computer games like _Age of Empires, Anno 1800_, and _Civilization_, and you'll get a good idea of how civilizations develop. You'll be the "player god" who organizes society, gives people commands, saves up the resources, invests in the science, and decides when to click "upgrade". When you do, civilization instantly transforms. Like magic, every house, factory, building, road, library, school is suddenly new and improved.

The above is a game, of course, but it represents reality pretty well. We're all in there somewhere, trying to figure out how to earn a living while our society transforms around us. It's hard—there is no player god and no magic button. Instead, we, the people inside the game, must collect the resources, do the research, and manually upgrade every part of our civilization bit by bit with blood, sweat, and tears. We can't sit back, click, and watch. We must live it.

Improving technology is hard work, but at least we understand how to do research and development. Improving politics isn't so straightforward, especially when society has one foot in an old era and one foot in a new era. This uncertainty is the world of politics and philosophy, civil wars, and revolutions I want to help you get a better sense of. Because in 1970, we entered the Digital Age. Since then, computer geeks, innovators, and hackers have been upgrading our society with ever more powerful digital ones. All the while, established Industrial Age powers have been holding them back.

Holding back technological and social development is why middle-class life is getting worse. Things will only improve once we finish the Digital Age upgrade. There's no shortcuts, cheats, or gimmicks. There's just you and your friends on Main Street. You all have to get out the sweat-bands, work gloves, and new ideas to upgrade every piece of our civilization to the Digital Age, bit by bit.

This book integrates lessons from the history, politics, and philosophy of prior upgrades, but it's not written for any buff. It uses the power of stories to help the people inside today's game—the middle-class—improve their own lives. The first step is a new mindset. Because we already have digital tools. We only need the middle-class to believe in a modern philosophy to enjoy all the wonders of the Digital Age.

## Looking Up to Philosophy

This book's illustration is a regular person standing on Main Street-a single person in the game of civilization. His or her job is to do what's best for themselves, and help society prosper. She's looking up for guidance and sees two options—heroes and villains. In the sky high above is the "player god" whose playing the game. Will the player god, play to benefit society, or to benefit himself?

In a computer game, when the player god presses the upgrade button, society transforms. In reality, we upgrade our society when we shop, do car repairs, and save up for a new home. Funny to think about, but our choices while shopping, dieting, socializing determine the health of our entire civilization. Yet we often don't think of ourselves as being "player gods". But that's the big picture, isn't it? That in fact, it's all our individual choices that make up the player god in the game of our civilization.

The more individuals realize the big picture and act like their actions matter, the healthier their society. And the job of inspiring individuals to believe in the big picture is the job of political philosophy. And that's who the heroes and villains are in the illustration. They represent the good and bad choices a regular person can make.

So what the heck are good choices today? It's especially hard to find good political answers. Every newspaper, politician, and political party says they're the heroes fighting for the good of our civilization. But politics has so much disagreement. How can the regular person on Main Street know the difference between heroes and villains? What's defines good and bad political opinions?

So there you are, on Main Street, looking up, trying to figure if Donald Trump is evil, or if the United Nations is trying to make a world government. You ask if Fox News is manufacturing fake news, or maybe "all of them" are. If so, what's real news? The questions never stop. Should the government-run health insurance, or a big corporation regulated by the government? Is climate change real? If so, why does my "green" obsessed company force me to drive to work every day? Whose fault is massive government debt? And if no one takes responsibility for the debt, what's the point of blaming anyone?

It's all very confusing and emotional. Yet you have to pick sides. After all, you're part of the player god as much as anyone else. Wouldn't it be cool if your political philosophy showed you the difference between good and bad politics today? It is cool; it's calming to understand politics. And it's one reason why I wrote this book. So I, and whoever reads it, can better understand what's wrong with today's politics. And also understand the new philosophy our society needs to prosper in the Digital Age.

## Your Politics

When a computer player in a civilization game "upgrades" technology, we can see technology changed. Damning a river, building a road, or installing sewers is very obvious.

When the computer player "upgrades" the game's philosophy, he installs a new ruling philosophy—like when we went from Divine Monarchy to American Democracy. But we can't see this change in real-world objects. The upgrade happens in our minds.

For example, Americans believe in "Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness," but what does that mean? So regular people look for more specific answers. Today they have several ideologies to pick from. Conservative or Progressive. Libertarian or Socialist. Republican or Democrat. A person uses an ideology to help make their own political opinions. Ideologies battle each other for the support of Main Street.

Technology, government, and political upgrades really are as simple as hitting "upgrade" as the player does in the clip above. It's just so damn hard to see when it comes to philosophy because it's our minds that are changing.

That being said, people are good at picking an ideology and then fighting for their political opinions. It's easy to argue, debate, vote, read books, and listen to radio shows. But understanding why we picked an ideology and created our political opinions is entirely different. Nobody ever says, "My family is old money. I have a huge trust fund. So I'm coasting through life.". Instead, the person says, "White privilege doesn't exist stupid!" Nobody says, "I'm a gullible person who works with lots of Liberal Arts graduates, so I don't like Trump because the crowd hates him." Instead, that person says, "Trump is not presidential!"

The point is, even with ideologies to guide our opinions, the real reason for your political views is hard to know. We all look up at the same ruling philosophy; we all try to "think of the big picture," yet we arrive at different answers. Our opinions are a by-product of our psychology, job, skillset, family, culture, ethnicity, religion, time-period. Who can understand how all these factors intermix to make a political opinion? Why does one parent cry tears of sadness, the other of joy, on the same election night?

I can't explain it either. But I can tell where you are in the story of civilization. Because when civilization upgrades to a new age, everyone is divided up into the same cast of characters. Some people struggle to retain power for themselves, some people fight to distribute power to the people, and the people—the ones on Main Street—either help the good guys or don't. The good guys are the heroes of the new age. The bad guys are the villains who hold back progress. And a person either helps the good guys upgrade civilization, or helps the antagonists survive longer. Inaction supports the status quo.

Today this translates to digital technologists fighting to give the power of new digital technology to the people on Main Street. The people who control Industrial Age technology fighting them off. And the people on Main Street have a choice, do they step up to help the good guys? To help the most, the people need to believe in a new ruling philosophy.

## Read Now or Read Later

There's a heck of a lot of emotions in Western politics today. Better put—people fucking hate each other. And many of those people don't know why. They're just mad. And not mad in the "I stepped in the puddle" sort of way. Mad in the comic book supervillain whose plans for world domination are going up in smoke "because the other side is ruining everything!" sort of way.

Let's get some perspective. People's days are increasingly unhappy. We pick an ideology to help us. Conservatism and Progressivism are the big choices because they spread around the world on the back of the Industrial Age. Now that we're in the Digital Age, we need a new philosophy to help us live better lives. But rather than rethink hundreds of years of "Left vs. Right" politics, people on each side blame the other for being outdated. Businessmen keep Conservatism relevant by "fighting communists," while social justice warriors keep Progressivism fresh by "fighting fascists." Fascism and communism (thankfully) died decades ago. Old ideologies survive by creating, then fighting, phantoms.

Left and Right use these dead ideologies to rationalize calling themselves Luke Skywalker and "the other side" Darth Vader. Left and Right want to distract the people—and themselves—because both sides are antagonists. Neither party understands the Digital Age.

We've upgraded our ruling philosophy before. Sadly, ruling philosophies usually die when their factions kill each other off. The Thirty Years War (1618-1648) is an example. Regular people chose between Catholics and Protestants and killed each other on behalf of "holy kings". Once the carnage ended, the people realized they were no better off—and that they were sick of kings all along. Thus, it wasn't long until ordinary people fought for a new ruling philosophy (Democracy) in the American Revolution (1776) and French Revolution (1789). Today Left and Right are in a similar boat. They make people think they're the only options. Fighting with impeachments, disputed elections, rallies, are what two factions do when neither can admit they're both behind the times.

It's important to remember, Conservativism and Progressivism helped us achieve great things in the Industrial Age. But building new cities, farms, sewers, and roads are the things that make a culture great. Politics is only supposed to help people in real-life work together, see the big picture, and play the game well. Because Left or Right politics can't help us upgrade society, they're supporters believe voting or yelling at the TV is being political. Bullshit. Politics is about every single choice you make made with the big picture in mind.

Do you watch TV or exercise at night? Do you read a book or watch infotainment? Do you seal your leaky taps or rant about climate change with another tweet? You are a single person in the game. You can only change your actions. And your efforts are pivotal. Because you're the player god.

To see the big-picture again, we need a new philosophy. One that looks ahead towards the boundless horizon of the Digital Age. One that sees Tesla, SpaceX, Blue Origin, as a sneak peek for the wondrous Digital Age future each person should be building now, bit by bit.

I could have written this has a political theory book or a history book. Instead, it's written as how-to-manual to the people on Main Street right now. Here's how we get back to work and win the game. You'll like it best if you're sick of contemporary politics but love checking-out what Elon is up to. Because you'll understand that with digital tools, most of today's political talking points are engineering problems, not political issues. You'll really like this book if you know that unless we see ourselves in the video below, evolution will find someone who does.

Humanity will continue the blessed journey of civilization one way or another. I wrote this book to get us there faster and easier. It's written to be like _Second Treatise of Government, On Social Contract_, and _Common Sense_. All books that made the people on Main Street realize the big picture that we're all the player god. And if we don't step up to upgrade our political philosophy to the Digital Age, we'll keep suffering the unknowns of a degenerating society that keeps looking down at phantom socialists and fascists, instead of looking up to our future in the stars.

If we don't upgrade our philosophy, at least with this book, we can read what we could have done as we regret the choices of player gods who lost the game.

Writer David Mamet once said being free from trying to please a group means being free to concentrate on Nature. So I embraced obscurity and was quite ambitious when writing this book. Saying that Techvolution is divided into three parts:

**A New Philosophy:** Upgrades our political philosophy to the Digital Age by getting Main Street to see the big picture. The people need to become a player god and use digital tools to solve their own problems. Their political leaders should be today's digital protagonists like Gates, Torvalds, and Musk.

**Building the Life Star:** Explains the new political and economic truth we'll see in the Digital Age. Using digital tools like big data, bio-monitors, bitcoin, the Life Star will give us much more accurate definitions of political and economic right and wrong. This will help us remove much political uncertainty in society. In short, the Life Star will do for politics and economics what scientific instruments did for physics and chemistry. The troubling part is many people won't accept what this telescope shows us.

**Starting Starfleet:** We'll conceptualize digital tools totally detached from the Industrial Age. These products will make The Digital Age lifestyle one of "perpetual profit." We'll send the massive savings to Musk and his protegees and hence, start Starfleet.

I want to be crystal clear about the purpose of this book. We're in the new and wondrous Digital Age. But we're using the political philosophy of the Industrial Age. That means not since the Conservatism and Progressivism cards were clicked in 1791, and 1855 respectively, have we had new ideas in politics.

We need a new philosophy that factors in all the wondrous possibilities of digital technology. We need a philosophy that empowers the people on Main Street to again see the big picture; that they're player gods whose choices determine the health of society. Watching TV isn't politics. Making good choices is politics. You should still vote, still debate what's best for your community, but making good choices is your most potent political power. If other people don't follow, leave them behind.

The people on Main Street today thus have the responsibility to find tools to solve their problems, which thereby solves the problems that plague today's middle class. The duty to solve problems also requires the freedom to choose any tool they want.

Tools can be anything: silicon caulking that seals leaky windows, the Waze app to lessen gridlock, or 3D printing a tool for your new business. The desire to seek out new tools is human evolution, which first happens in the human mind that reads a modern philosophy. We've upgraded our philosophy before. The book below is the best way I know how to do it for our society today. I hope it's good enough to click.

_This is politics. You''re looking at two people "player gods", because they saw a problem and used modern technology to solve it. No rallies. No screaming. No news channel to tune into. The problem with our society regular people don't act like this. And even worse, it's often against the rules to act like this. Because industiral Age companies want us to keep using their stuff. More on that below._
