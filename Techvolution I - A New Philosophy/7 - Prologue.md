We've come some way in the story Stargazer. Let's take a minute and answer some questions you might be thinking.

First off, a new ruling philosophy doesn't mean you throw away all the old stuff. Old philosophies, red/blue among them, will always teach us lessons, help us do our jobs better, and enlighten our personal opinions. Today old philosophies should not be our ruling philosophy because they weren't created with digital tools in mind.

Techvolution is. It's designed to make the best use of digital tools. Let me explain how Techvolution can be our ruling political philosophy by discussing evolution in martial arts.

Humanity has many martial arts: karate, kickboxing, wrestling, jiu-jitsu, judo, and boxing being among the most popular. Each martial art adapts the human body to do specific technique like punches or choke-holds. Each martial art also makes rules, so only their chosen techniques are allowed during competition; there's no kicking in a boxing match, for example.

In the early 1990s, the martial arts community got curious and wondered whose martial art would win a real fight. On reflection, it seems funny that this was an original idea, but before the 1990s, people just assumed boxers or wrestlers could not fight outside their rulebook. All fighters were supposed to be ideologically loyal and sing to their choirs about their techniques being the best. If a fighter got their ass kicked in a real fight, they'd often blame themselves or say the other guy "broke the rules" and "cheated."

When the martial art community threw away their rule books and held "no rules" tournaments, they were fittingly rewarded with Nature's officially best martial art. The best martial art was none of them; or all of them. The best fighters trained all techniques and used the ones they thought would defeat their opponent based on the exact moment they were fighting them. A large toolbox of techniques and an open mind to adapt proved to be the best martial art. Fighters embracing adaption and natural selection was the start of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA), a new sport that cherishes the evolution mantra "admit defeat and learn." And while boxers still punch the best, and kickboxers kick the best, evolution powered MMA fighters will almost always beat them in a street fight.

Red/blue ideologies are like non-MMA martial arts. They teach a limited number of techniques, limit themselves to their own rule book, and often think "the other side" is ignorant. Ideologues often accuse non-believers of cheating after losing a debate or election. However, in their area of expertise, from monetary policy to farm regulation, red/blue have a massive reservoir of know-how. This single book can't replace all that knowledge. It would be laughable to suggest it could.

But we still need a new ruling philosophy. One created from the lessons of evolution and digital tools old philosophies did not factor in simply because they're so old. There's no other way to harness digital tools fully. Hence why this book is about making human technological evolution, Techvolution, the most protected political right (and responsibility) today.

You can think of Techvolution as "mixed philosophy politics." Under Techvolution, a person is free to study and believe in old philosophies. But no one should think the rule books of old philosophies determine right and wrong when up against a person's right to evolve on the frontline. Because to evolve humanity, we the people on the frontline—the people in the real fight—need the freedom to decide which tool best solves a problem. The right to evolve must trump all other considerations. Giving old philosophies, or people whose power and prestige is based on old tools, the right to decide human technological upgrades is a recipe for inaction. This set-up is basically why the middle-class is getting beat up by relatively simple problems like road traffic, waiting on hold, and confusing loan contracts.

Importantly, since Techvolution is a vital right, it must also be a responsibility. Here are some tools the middle-class should grab hold of today.

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation recently funded TerraPower, a new nuclear reactor fueled by depleted uranium. Among many other reasons, because they could use supercomputers to design it, TerraPower made nuclear power much safer. Bill and Melinda hope dozens of their reactors will keep the world's lights on for generations, but even they can't afford to buy them. Should we tell our governments too? I don't know, I'm no expert. But nuclear power is clean, and continuing to breath in smog and ejecting greenhouse gases into the air is hardly a good thing. So, considering that electricity powers all digital tools and digital tools empower the middle-class. And some of our wealthiest and smartest people think TerraPower is a good idea. Then it's something we should all think about out of pure evolutionary self-interest.

3D printers are like inkjet printers, except they fuse particles together and thus can print 3D objects, even ones as complicated as a violin. They're very common in industrial prototyping. Regular people could use them to print lost buttons, toy action figures imagined by kids, or custom-designed garden tools. The best part of 3D printers is there's no factories, cargo ships, tractor-trailers, marketing campaigns, or retail stores needed. Anyone can print whatever they need whenever they need it. Sadly, most people have never even seen a 3D printer never-mind bought one of its printed products. It's a shame we should fix quickly.

I didn't draw any of this book's illustrations. I've also never met the artists who did or even spoken with them. Instead I used paint.net to edit photos and put them together in design software called Figma. Then I found illustrators via online marketplaces and said: "please draw me this." Within days I had the illustrations I needed. Today anyone can work with experts to write computer code, make a gift, or design a custom 3D printed construction tool. All with no job interviews, management oversight, or upfront cost. Online worker-to-worker collaboration is that easy; once we think to look for it.

As said before, the Woodstock era is a dead. We've exported the millions of skilled jobs that funded it, distracted ourselves from that stupidity by borrowing money to buy flashy products from industries that keep needing subsidies or bailouts. The expectation that middle-class people will get one job for life and safely assume "the government" or "the market" will solve all our problems does nothing but give false hope of a "forever Woodstock lifestyle." And think of this, about 80,000 people worked at Blockbuster, about 5,000 work for Netflix. Why would that automation trend stop for your industry?

In my experience, many people often reply "won't happen to my job"; then go back to watching Netflix.

Digital tools don't threaten us. They're our salvation. If we use them we can educate ourselves, lower our own cost of living, earn our own income, and most important, collaborate. Can we become entirely self-sufficient? Probably not, but we can deal with layoffs, price-gouging, and bad jobs better with a level balance of power.

Keep in mind, all the examples of digital tools in this book are just a snippet. There are many more out there, and once the open-source Jedi finally get our support, we'll be spoiled for choices. And regular people imagining a cornucopia of digital tools is the rebellion inside our mind the world needs right now.

In short, Techvolution says, be selfish! Demand your freedom! Freedom to speak our minds made the most of the printing press. Freedom to investigate Nature made the most of scientific instruments. Freedom to question royalty made the most of the gun. Freedom to buy products made the most of factories. And the freedom to solve your own real-life problems makes the most of digital tools.

Techvolution starts in your head. While you're watching a political debate, or attending a company meeting, ask yourself, "what's in this for me." Of course, red/blue politicians won't talk about a direct democracy app, and I don't want you to tell your boss to go to hell and quit your job. But society first changes in your mind. As you keep asking "what's in this for me," you'll seek out new digital tools. When you hold new tools, you hold political power. And holding power is how extras become protagonists.

That's why controlling tools is the Nature of all political battles. Whether in galaxies far far away, street fights in parking lots, wars between nations, or your own life. It's why antagonists so often make new tools against the rules. And why I needed to write a book to remind everyone rules are supposed to serve human evolution, not get in its way. But since today the rules are in our way Stargazer, we must pack our bags, rally our friends, and get ready for a fight. It's time to blow up a Death Star.
