# Prologue

I wrote this for the people on GitHub, Udemy, Slack, Firefox, Sketch and whatever else you Jedi are working on. Learning your ecosystem of new tools was cool. Learning your unspoken philosophy was even cooler.

Most people don't understand the power and accessability of your work. It's too different. Regular people still think stuff like news, manufacturing, and education is something only government or businesses can do. Yet because of open-source any person can use GitHub, Udemy, StackOverflow, to create _whatever they can imagine_. It's a new world. One where Cinderella goes to the ball simply because she wanted to have fun.

Open-source has no guards because it wants everyone to contribute. From Ryan Dahl making Node, to a coder improving a Rails gem, to a grandpa writing a Wikipedia article. The more people share their work, the more problems are solved, and the better the party gets.

Open-source works because all ideas, plans, and results are shared and tracked. Everyone knows whose responsibile and where help is needed. It's not perfect; some people are dicks, projects die off, politics gets involved. But that's humanity. Only by empowering us with better tools do we empower our better sides to flourish.

And people contribute just by using your tools. I'm a lone philosophy, politics, and history geek who spends his days thinking about political philosophy. With Markdown, VS Code (amazing for writing), and Ghost I can write and host my work. With Word and Figma I can collaborate with world-class illustrators and writers with no middleman. It's no surprise a book promoting open-source is illustrated, edited, and hosted using your own tools.

Open-source still can’t run the world. In _The Innovators_ Walter Isaacson explains how the trifecta of militaries, academic institutions, and private corporations created the digital revolution. Likewise, it was for profit companies, academic institutions, and open-source programmers who kept it going.

But open-source is the next step in human evolution. It’s so pivotal because it’s a check against middleman making gates to the party. With open-source these Darth Blockbusters couldn’t stop a few hackers from giving the world internet streaming. An upgrade that saved society billions of needless miles picking up and dropping off DVDs.

Yet open-source struggles. Organizations like Wikipedia, Mozilla, Ghost. Channels like Real Engineering, CodeCademy, and Traversy Media. The people making new programs throughout the internet. All often need donations just to keep going. All while old tools like universities, television broadcasters, and movie studios get subsidies, tax credits, and bail outs.

This difference signifies our society's great divide; the Darth Blockbusters of old tools fighting to keep themselves in power with society's money, while open-source makes new tools that usurp them and distribute that power and money to the people.

At first I only wanted to learn about open-source's fight. Now I want to unite you. There’s no difference between the soldiers who fought Darth King George III and you, the modern minuteman who work so regular people can control their own lives and better their families.

You all feel the “majic” of new tools but have a hard time explaining why. Humanity still doesn’t understand how our “cyborgology” changes us when we pick up a radio, a smartphone, or a lightsaber (one day!). With Techvolution, people will know why open-source are the good guys. Terms like “Darth Blockbuster”, “Death Star rule book”, “internet Jedi”, make the world easier to understand for the struggling middle class.

We need a new philosophy to win the fight. Neither regular people or open-source will go anywhere with typical "red/blue" politics. These philosphies are very outdated. Their believers march and yell like its Woodstock in 1969, because technologically speaking they love 1969. Gas cars, nightly newscasts, 9-5 work days, two car garages; their ideal way of life is a never ending _Simpsons_ episode. Open-source can't use these philosophies to change the world. You're not going to tax-cut or flower-power your way past the future's antagonists.

Because there are many Darth Blockbuster’s in its way. To overcome them you have to realize it's you _versus_ them. They live to make people use their old tools like DVDs, road maps, lecture halls, paper insurance forms, and backed up call-centers. They fear open-source tools sending them back to equality. They do so with the outmost sincerity and conviction that they’re the “martyrs of the people”. The power of digital tools is as lost to them as books, guns, and telescopes was to Darth King. Although they’re usually very well-intentioned people, they can't accept a new era has come.

Like fans of an aging sitcom, the people are too distracted to notice our aging philosophy. We're so used to seeing the same political family names, cable news shows, 60 Minute interviews, car commercials, fantasy football stats to notice open-source new tools can replace our old and suffering economy and empower the middle class to new heights.

We have a chance to gain support. Everytime a regular person has yet another problem with their tax forms, car radiator, ashphalt shingles, or whatever old tool the antagonists are keeping alive, is when the pain of living on the frontline makes regular people search for a better way to live.

This moment is where I want to return the favour and empower open-source. Because this is where all its coders, designers, testers, and contributors can gain a member by saying "I am part of the open-source movement inventing new tools to solve problems like this... and we need your help... because our own ruling philosophy is holding us all back".

And if the regular person asks what they heck you're talking about, you can tell them to read Techvolution, then go back to changing the world.
