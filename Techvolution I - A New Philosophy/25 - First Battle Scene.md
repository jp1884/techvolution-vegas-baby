# First Battle Scene

## Introduction

In the 1970's the transistor, internet, screens, and other digital technology, started to leave labs and research centres and make their way into products. Finally, after centuries of limited tools, society had ones cheap enough to mass produce, yet were powerful enough to change our way of life. Of course, that's when Darth Blockbuster appeared and went to work defending his way of life.

Some examples. In the 1970's AT&T successfully lobbied to ban American from using internet modems. In 1984 the entertainment industry attacked home video recorders in "Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.". In 2001, the music industry attacked digital songs in "A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc.". Throughout society, the antagonists found ways to prevent the majical possibilities digital tools offered society.

Even when offered help the antagonists resisted. When setting up iTunes Steve Jobs described dealing with music executives like this "I've never spent so much of my time trying to convince people to do the right thing for themselves".

From Galileo to Washington, Tesla to Jobs, the battle  between antagonits, protagoinsts, and extras has been the same. Here's what it looks like.

## How New Tools Start the Fight

Technological evolution is similar to its biological cousin. We have adaptations of existing lifeforms, and then totally new lifeforms. In technology this the difference between a new technology and new tool.

Upgrading a technology isn't a big deal. Sedan's and SUV's, tube televisons's and LCD's, VHS and DVD's, are basically the same. Different technologically, but they do the same job in society. But when we upgraded enough technologies, like microchips, touchscreens, batteries, and WiFi, we unlocked a new tool: smartphones. And this is a big deal.

Why? Well, because creating a new tool asks a climactic and political  question: who controls it? After all, whoever does, is more powerful. Thus, while civilization is a struggle to overcome problems by upgrading technology and inventing new tools, it’s also a battle to control them. The people with the old tool usually want to retain their power, while inventors and innovators imagine a new society that shares it.

The eternal story of civilization is thus protagonists making new tools, antagonists attacking new tools, and many extras watching them fight. Our politics is an ongoing history of technological change, with inventor and gatekeeper both reaching for the tool to make themselves the winner.

Today the extras are not self-aware of their power to decide the winner. I’ll show you how important you are. Here’s how you changed the world just by being curious.

## Extras Killed Wikipedia's Evil Twin

People always have some nagging question. Like what diseases do ticks carry, or why did World War II start. Constant questions are a problem and we need a reference tool to solve it. True to ourselves, we make one with the technology available and upgrade it when possible.

Our first reference tool was the wisdom of our elders. The first technological upgrades were papyrus scrolls and ink (500 BC) and books (500), which turned some elders into experts like Hippocrates and Aristotle. When wood-pulp paper (1200) and the printing press (1456) were invented, humanity unleashed mass-produced books. Now experts could share knowledge between themselves and educate the masses. We called the reference books encyclopedias.

People loved encyclopedias. For the first time, many answers were available on demand. The _Encyclopedia Britannica_ (1878) was the standard. It went into continuous publication (1933) to keep people updated to the latest facts. In the following decades, the computer, digital printer, and telecommunications meant encyclopedias were written and stored digitally. But they remained a digital set of books controlled by experts.

Then came the world wide web (1991), a new technology that unlocked many new tools like websites, forums, blogs, and something called “wikis”. Wiki software lets anyone write or edit a webpage by pressing “edit now”. All changes are saved, so anyone can erase errors or vandalism by pressing “undo now”. For years programmers used wikis to collaboratively write technical manuals.

As web tools boomed in the late ’90’s, protagonist Jimmy Wales wondered if the web could upgrade encyclopedias. Today, most of us who were curious about things like candy apples know that our quest ends with a free online encyclopedia anyone can edit called Wikipedia. But it didn’t start out that way.

Wikipedia started as Nupedia (2000). Nupedia was a free online copycat of Encyclopedia Britannica where only “expert” professors made articles. Wikipedia (2001) was a side project. Only programmers knew “community content creation” would work.

Everyone else assumed regular people would only read the work of professors. The first issue with this theory was that the professors didn’t like to share their knowledge. In its first year, Nupedia had 12 articles. Wikipedia had 40,000, which most professors loved to belittle as rubbish and disallowed students from referencing them in their papers. Yet professors refused to improve, or to assign students to improve, Wikipedia.

The second issue was that it turned out “expert” answers and “regular” answers are the same. Ticks carry typhus, rickettsialpox, boutonneuse fever, and many more diseases. And thirdly, most importantly, Wikipedia turned many extras into protagonists! A huge community of non-academics voluntarily shared their knowledge one “edit now” at a time and fiercely protected their common knowledge with “undo now”.

And lastly, so many of the remaining extras flocked to Wikipedia. The extra’s mass support quickly made Wikipedia king, while giving Nupedia and Encyclopedia Britannica quick deaths.

That’s the story of Wikipedia. Made by new protagoinsts, made the standard reference tool by empowered extras. Few believed it was possible, because even professors don’t understand new tools always unpower the few, to empower the rest. Interestingly, after I finally conceded temporary defeat to my personal Darth Blockbuster, I uploaded a few pages to Wikipedia instead. Not as helpful as my app, but it took just a few weeks of work, and one “edit now” button, to make it real.

## You Can Win

Wikipedia's victory is another example of an archetypal human story. Like Galileo and his telescope, George Washington and his musket, and Steve Jobs and his iPod. Wikipedia was a victory for protagonists against antagonists. What makes it especially cool, is the extras played such a big part.

And that’s the story I want to empower all the extras to join with lightsabers a-blazin’, dicing up old tools like the evil storm troopers they are, to smooth out humanity’s natural evolution. Note however, our lives cut across thousands to millions of problems. Thus, our villians are not in a massive group like “the rich” or the “the unions” as old philosophies label. Instead we have villians inside thousands of companies, institutions, and organizations, withholding new tools, so they can keep their version of the DVD alive.

The extras can kill all these Darth Blockbuster's. I know this because our battle today was fought generations ago with his master, Darth King.

Darth King lived inside palaces, using society’s money to host splendid banquests and balls. His absolute power was hidden inside a ruling philosophy of the “noble’s divine right to rule”. Slowly, as protagonists invented scientific instruments, books, and guns, a new philosophy was born. A philosophy of science, enlightenment, equality, and democracy made real when the protagonists and extras fought as one in the American and French Revolutions. They were inspired by the new philosophy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau.
