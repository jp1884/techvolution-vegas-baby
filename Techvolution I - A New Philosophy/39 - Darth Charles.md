# King's Choice

## Place in line

When Rousseau was being chased around Europe, King Louis XVI rule France and King George III ruled England. Both faced revolutions inspired by the pain on the frontline their mismanagement of government, its finances caused. However, these weren't the first kings to face revolts.

Before Rousseau explain frontline problems to the people. The people still rose up against noble's excesses and incompetent leadership. Without Rousseau's new philosophy they used Christian theology. Among the first to face the people's wrath was King Charles I, who ruled England from 1625-1649.

Charles ruled as an absolute monarch under the "nobles right to rule" ruling philosophy. England had a Parliament but it was supposed to advise the king, not tell him what to do. After some revolts in the Middle Ages, parliament did however earn the power to approve taxes.

After years of past monarchs mismanaging government finances, and Charles overspending himself, he needed money. Parliament refused to say yes until it got more powers. Charles refused to talk. Instead he sent parliament home, and ruled by himself for 10 years. He raised taxes using some very old feudal tithes and rules. One retroactively fined some men for not showing up to Charles' coronation 10 years earlier. Their version of not reading the fine print.

Parliament eventually got sick of this subversion, raised an army of fervent Christians, and fought the English Civil War (1642–1646). These army was local men, whose officers were chosen by merit. Charles men were mostly nobles who hired mercenaries to fight for them. The war was bad. It inspired the saying that life without a working government is "nasty, brutish, and short".

Charles lost. He was held under arrest, while rules for a "constituional monarchy" were being made by the Parliamentarians. Charles escaped. Hired a new army, and fought the Second English Civil War (1648–1649).

Charles lost again. Parliment was enraged. They fervent Christians forgot about a constitutional monarch, and charged Charles for crimes against the English people. Quite a novel idea at the time. But even if they didn't have Rousseau's philosophy yet, the people were still empowered by guns, books, and scientific instruments to start to think for themselves. While they didn't have a new ruling philosophy, the people were at least questioning the one in power.

Charles didn't budge. He was the descedant of 1,000 years of noble blood. He was the natural leader the same way a father is the leader of his children. Charles refused to speak to the court because a father doesn't answer to his children. But then Charles did speak, and that fact, showcases how set the Sith are in their stories.

## Charles Speaks

Charles had a speech impediment. Often called a stammer or studder. No one then, or even now, understands what causes it. It's annoying to listen to. Like your speaker wire is frayed, and the music is choppy.

That's because talking with a stutter is like playing guitar with music notes written on the fly by a gremlin. Some words are easy to say, some are ~~difficult~~ hard, and some decide which at the last mili-mili-mili-second. The stutterer has to jump around the words in real time. Fail and you miss a beat.

But a stutter isn't just pauses. Stuttering feels like getting hit with a stun gun, or having a mini-seizure. You're body seizes. Your neck tenses. You stop breathing. It's horrible and it can happen every fourth word.

The physical pain isn't even the worst. Getting _that_ look from people is. The "what the fuck is wrong with you?" look.

Hello, my ~~name~~ I go by John-ne. I wa-want ~~can~~ want to help ~~master~~ human evol-ution. I've been ~~writ~~ trying to write this book for ~~about~~ ah ~~five~~...

The prospect of talking, except to yourself and a dog, which Charles had two of, causes huge anxiety. The idea of never conversing with anyone causes huge loneliness and depression. _The King's Speech_ showed it well. Stuttering usually forces a person to be shy, passive, eager to please, and come up with weired reasons for their erratic speaking like hand gestures, random silence, binge drinking, and swear words (which for some reason never cause a stutter). It's entirely possible King Charles' relationship with Parliament was so bad because he simply didn't want to talk with them. Not that he would ever admit he had a impediment. After all, he was a king!

I know this all because luckily enough (kidding) I have the same affliction as Charles. It was the reason I got a job in a car insurance claim department. After a vice president at an old company secretly told my supervisor I wasn't allowed to talk to customers, for fear of embarrasing the company, I was like shit I guess I don't have this damn gremlin under control. I wasn't even that mad about it (although I was that it was an open secret for over a year). I never told anyone I had the impediment, so despite therapy as a kid, it was obviously still a problem.

So fuck it. I decided to jump in the pool and sink or swim. A car insurance claim call-centre is like the Olympic trials for a stutterer. A daily workout of all day phone calls, angry drivers, customer service expectations, no "outs" like swear words, booze, or wonky behavior to hide behind.

And it was far worse then I thought. The insurance company wanted adjusters to answer ever more phone calls. To incentize us, they'd ring a monotone "bell" because... I don't know. They never said why, we employees learned questioning "the bell" was a bad idea. Management used it as punishment; "answer more phone calls or we'll make the bell faster and louder!".

I'm being serious by the way. We were often more stressed then the person who just had a car crash. Whatever the reason, DING-DING-DING-DING all day, which gave people who weren't stutterers huge anxiety, breakdowns, and stress leaves.

Super-shock speech therapy! After about a year I didn't have to massage my jaws at night to release it from all the teeth shattering jaw-clenches I did to divert vocal stuttering. I was cured!

The point is this. That's what it took for me to mostly, except when pretenious cultures limit my word choices, never stutter. It's like night and day. The anxiety washed away the more pitch perfect things I said. A hidden outgoing personality was brought out and frankly is fun, although still surreal, to be.

Yet Charles never had this lesson. He was famoulsy shy, quiet, and anxious his whole life because the gremlin likes it that way. Even when fighting for 16 years defending his ruling philosophy, Charles still probably had to massage his strained jaws every night. I can sympathize. The gremlin is a bully.

At Charles trial, a Christian king, faced a Christian uprising. However, while the soldiers were inspired by sermons from the Bible, Charles was accused of being "a Tyrant, A Traitor, Murderer, and a public enemy to the Commonwealth of England". Not a bad Christian king but a bad ruler. The people of England, empowered with many books, scientific instruments, and especially guns of a healthy civilization, were firing their leader. A novel ideal at the time.

The prosecutors didn't have Rousseau's new ruling philosophy to reference, but nor did they use a Christian one either. They simple said Charles didn't have a "divine right to rule" and asked for the death penalty. Charles wouldn't even acknowledge the trial. He didn't believe his life was on the chopping block. Kings don't answer to children.

Charles wasn't pretending or bluffing. He wasn't proud, or stubborn. He psychologically couldn't understand even the idea of being wrong. He lived in a different story with a different ruling philosophy. One that made him the protagonist.

The judges convicted Charles anyway. He was sentenced to death by removing the head from the body. Charles was flabbergasted. He finally spoke in his defense at the execution. Fuck the ringing bell of a claims department, Charles only had words to justify himself to his (supposed) subjects, and to history. And... and... no stutter. Not once!

Charles freely, openely, spoke the music of his mind.

He didn't just speak, he spoke so eloquently many people, even those who hated him, were impressed. He spoke so well, so clearly, people heard no gremlin! Fuck... I'm happy for him. It must have felt like God killed the gremlin. Indeed Charles's last words were a clearly spoken:

> Truly I desire their (the people’s) liberty and freedom as much as anybody whomsoever; but I must tell you their liberty and freedom consist in having of government, those laws by which their life and their goods may be most their own. It is not for having a share in government, Sir, that is nothing pertaining to them. A subject and a ruler are clear different things...therefore I tell you that I am the Martyr of the people. I die a Christian according to the profession of the Church of England, as I found it left me by my father... I have a good Cause and I have a gracious God. I will say no more.

Clealr spoken words of being behind the times. Charles was not needed. His people could rule themselves. He should have been happy his children grew up. Instead he used their money to hire foreigners to kill them. Like a comedians who thinks he's funny because he never listens to the crowd.

Yet Charles was merely defending the rules as defined by the ruling philosophy. Despite massive government debt, a restless population, and many chances for compromise, he didn't want to fix frontline problems, but protect the rules. He was an antagonist. The extras followed the protagonists, reached for new tools, fought and won their empowerment.

Later kings still didn't learn. Even more distanced from the frontline inside their palaces and banquets and balls, their heads filled with gremlins tell them the rules are just, good, and last forever. Country wide banktrupcies, food shortages, and revolutions didn't kill these gremlins. Like Charles each faced the chopping block with the voice of God calling them martyrs.

So tell me, why did you ever think Darth Blockbuster was ever going to let Obi-Wan go?

Whenever the Death Star is struck down, a new heirachy forms around the new tools. And when human technological evolution surpasses these tools, the Sith use societ's rule book to keep themselves at the top, and the supposed children on the bottom.

So Darth Blockbuster hands Obi-Wan his weapon, and offers a duel.

And one more time a Jedi knight fights a Sith lord. They swipe, slice, jump and leap. Obi-Wan is doing well. But he knows he can't win this fight alone. For as long as the hierarchy exists, killing one king, only lets another take his place.

The Death Star is a tool, a rule book that keeps new tools down, and the extras distracted from their natural Techvolution. To trule defeat Darth Blockbuster and the Sith, we must make a tool that replaces the Death Star, and continually enforces our natural evolution. We need Techvolution's rule book.

And only we, the extras, can build it. Thus, as Obi-Wan looks over at his student, he knows his job is done. He looks over at you Skywalker, and he sees not the kid asking about the rebellion of the mind, but the kid who will win the rebellion with a new tool.

Obi-Wan lifts his sword. Darth Blockbuster quickly strikes him down, and kills the Jedi master.

Now, Skywalker you have to build the tool to forever defeat the Death Star. It keeps coming back, interfering with Techvolution. While Techvolution is the new philosophy that literally empowers humanity to technological evolve, without a tool to make it real, the Sith will return with a new Death Star of rules.

Now, we can build the Jedi's Life Star by asking a simple question, the same one that killed Darth King. How old are you?
