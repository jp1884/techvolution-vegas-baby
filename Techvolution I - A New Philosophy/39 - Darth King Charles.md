# King's Choice

## Place in line

When Rousseau was being chased around Europe, King Louis XVI rule France and King George III ruled England. Both faced revolutions inspired by the pain on the frontline their mismanagement of government, its finances caused. However, these weren't the first kings to face revolts.

Before Rousseau explain frontline problems to the people. The people still rose up against noble's excesses and incompetent leadership. Without Rousseau's new philosophy they used Christian theology. Among the first to face the people's wrath was King Charles I, who ruled England from 1625-1649.

Charles ruled as an absolute monarch under the "nobles right to rule" ruling philosophy. England had a Parliament but it was supposed to advise the king, not tell him what to do. After some revolts in the Middle Ages, parliament did however earn the power to approve taxes.

After years of past monarchs mismanaging government finances, and Charles overspending himself, he needed money. Parliament refused to say yes until it got more powers. Charles refused to talk. Instead he sent parliament home, and ruled by himself for 10 years. He raised taxes using some very old feudal rules. One retroactively fined some men for not showing up to Charles' coronation.

Parliament eventually got sick of this subversion, raised an army of fervent Christians, and fought the English Civil War (1642–1646). These Englishman accused Charles of being Catholic, who they hated. Their army was local men, whose officers were chosen by merit. Charles men were mostly nobles, who hired mercenaries to fight for them. The war was bad. It inspired the saying that life without a working government is "nasty, brutish, and short".

Charles lost. He was held under arrest, while rules for a "constituional monarchy" were being made by the Parliamentarians. Charles escaped. Hired a new army, and fought the Second English Civil War (1648–1649).

Charles lost again. Parliment was enraged. They fervent Christians forgot about a constitutional monarch, and charged Charles for crimes against the English people. Quite a novel idea at the time. But even if they didn't have Rousseau's philosophy yet, the people were still empowered by guns, books, and scientific instruments to start to think for themselves. While they didn't have a new ruling philosophy, the people were at least questioning the one in power.

Charles didn't budge. He was the descedant of 1,000 years of noble blood. He was the natural leader the same way a father is the leader of his children. Charles refused to speak to the court because a father doesn't answer to his children. But then Charles did speak, and that fact, showcases how set the Sith are in their stories.

## Charles Speaks

Charles had a speech impediment. Often called a stammer or studder. No one then, or even now, understands what causes it. It's like your thoughts and your tongue are connectd by a frayed electrical cord. Sometimes the electricity flows and sometimes it doesn't. In practice this means some words are easy to say, some are ~~difficult~~ hard, and some decide which at the last mili-mili-mili-second.

Talking with a stutter is like playing guitar with music notes written on the fly by a gremlin. Every sentence is a stream of sayable, non sayable, and maybe sayable words. The stutterer has to jump around the words in real time. Fail and you stutter. But a stutter isn't just pauses. Stuttering feels like getting hit with a stun gun. You're body seizes. Your neck tenses. You stop breathing. It's horrible.

The physical pain isn't even the worst. Getting _that_ look from people is. The "what the fuck is wrong with you?" look, is.

Hello, my ~~name~~ I go by John-ne. I wa-want ~~can~~ want to help ~~master~~ human evol-ution. I've been ~~writ~~ trying to write this book for ~~about~~ ah ~~five~~...

The prospect of talking, except to yourself and a dog, which Charles had two of, causes huge anxiety. The idea of never conversing with anyone causes huge depression. _The King's Speech_ showed it well. Stuttering usually forces a person to be shy, passive, eager to please, and come up with weired reasons for their erratic speaking like hand gestures, random silence, binge drinking, and swear words (which for some reason never cause a stutter). It's entirely possible King Charles' relationship with Parliament was so bad because he simply didn't want to talk with them. Not that he would ever admit he had a problem. After all, he was a king!

I know this all because luckily enough (kidding) I have the same affliction as Charles. It was the reason I got a job in a car insurance claim department. After a vice president at an old company secretly told my supervisor I wasn't allowed to talk to customers, for fear of embarrasing the company, I was like shit I guess I don't have this damn gremlin under control. I wasn't even that mad about it (although I was that they lied about it for a year). I never told anyone I had the impediment, so despite therapy as a kid, it was obviously still a problem.

So fuck it. I decided to jump in the pool and sink or swim. A car insurance claim call-centre is like the Olympic trials for a stutterer. A daily workout of all day phone calls, angry drivers, customer service expectations, no "outs" like swear words, booze, or wonky behavior to hide behind.

And it was far worse then I thought. The insurance company wanted adjusters to answer ever more phone calls. To incentize us, they'd ring a monotone "bell" because... I don't know. They never said why it was a good idea. We employees learned whatever we did, questioning "the bell" was a bad idea. Management used it as punishment; "answer more phone calls or we'll make the bell faster and louder!".

I'm being serious by the way. We were often more stressed then the person who just had a car crash. Whatever the reason, DING-DING-DING-DING all day, which gave people who weren't stutterers huge anxiety, breakdowns, and stress leaves.

Super-shock speech therapy! After about a year I didn't have to massage my jaws at night to release it from all the teeth shattering jaw-clenches I did to divert vocal stuttering. I was cured!

The point is this. That's what it took for me to mostly, except when pretenious cultures limit my word choices, never stutter. It's like night and day. A hidden outgoing personality was brought out and frankly is fun, although still surreal, to be.

Yet Charles never had this lesson. He was famoulsy shy, quiet, and anxious his whole life because the gremlin likes it that way. Even when fighting a 10 year war defending his ruling philosophy, Charles still probably had to massage his strained jaws every night. I can sympathize. The gremlin is a bully.

At Charles trial, a Christian king, faced a Christian uprising. However, while the soldiers were inspired by sermons from the Bible, Charles was accused of being "a Tyrant, A Traitor, Murderer, and a public enemy to the Commonwealth of England". Not a bad Christian king but a bad ruler. The people of England, empowered with many books, scientific instruments, and especially guns of a healthy civilization, were firing their leader. A novel ideal at the time.

The prosecutors didn't have Rousseau's new ruling philosophy to reference, but nor did they use a Christian one either. They simple said Charles didn't have a "divine right to rule" and asked for the death penalty. Charles wouldn't even acknowledge the trial. He didn't believe his life was on the chopping block. Kings don't answer to children.

Charles wasn't pretending or bluffing. He wasn't proud, or stubborn. He psychologically couldn't understand even the idea of being wrong. He lived in a different story with a different ruling philosophy. One that made him the protagonist.

The judges convicted Charles anyway. He was sentenced to death by removing the head from the body. Charles was flabbergasted. He finally spoke in his defense at the execution. Fuck the ringing bell of a claims department, Charles only had words to justify himself to his (supposed) subjects, and to history. And... and... no stutter. Not once!

Charles freely, openely, spoke the music of his mind.

He didn't just speak, he spoke so eloquently many people, even those who hated him, were impressed. He spoke so well, so clearly, people heard no gremlin! Fuck... I'm happy for him. It must have felt like God killed the gremlin. Indeed Charles's last words were a clearly spoken:

> Truly I desire their (the people’s) liberty and freedom as much as anybody whomsoever; but I must tell you their liberty and freedom consist in having of government, those laws by which their life and their goods may be most their own. It is not for having a share in government, Sir, that is nothing pertaining to them. A subject and a ruler are clear different things...therefore I tell you that I am the Martyr of the people. I die a Christian according to the profession of the Church of England, as I found it left me by my father... I have a good Cause and I have a gracious God. I will say no more.

Clealr spoken words of being behind the times. Charles was not needed. He was no Charlemagne. His people could rule themselves. He should have been happy his children grew up.

He wasn't. No matter what the extras and protagonists did, no noble say the end of got it ruling philosophy doesn't last forever. The nobles divine right to rule was a ruling philosophy. The ruling philosophy was wrong because it was behind the technological times. We shouldn't wait for our red / blue philosophy based on limited tools, to cause civil wars and revolutions before thinking about making some changes.

The best way to do that, is show you a better reality than just following the rules. So to replace the Death Star, here's the better reality made by Techvolution, as seen by the Life Star.
