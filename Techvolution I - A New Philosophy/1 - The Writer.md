# CHAPTER SIX - THE WRITER

## The Writer

If we're going to master the human story, but proactively changing to its twists and turns via techvolution, we have should understand how our story is written. Like any story ours has props, emotions, dialogue, motivations, characters, and plot. By deconstructing stories, we'll understand our own.

## The Nature of Storytelling

A story is a character addressing a problem through a series of events. The events are organized in three parts. The first is the introduction of the protagonist who realizes a problem she wants to solve, and the antagonist who wants to keep things the same. The second part is where both characters and their supporters fight over the problem. The third part is the conclusion, where we find out which side will win. Both the characters and the viewers enjoy, or dread, the drama of not knowing which side will win. The goal and art of storytellng is making the audience always wonder that's going to happen next because nobody can be sure.

_In_ Cinderella _the forces of good organize to defeat the forces of her evil step-family. A classic rags to riches tale._

Good storytelling makes us wonder by telling a surprising, yet rational, story. Believability in turn allows the audience to invest their emotions. That's why a well-told story makes us feel surprised, intrigued, mad, disgusted, joyous, and so on. Look at the faces of people during a good movie and you'll see how transfixed they are. It's because the movie is very believable and the audience is wondering what's going to happen next. Wondering what's going to happen next makes the audience minds open to the different ways of life inside foreign cities, mythical worlds, and galaxies far far away.

## Story Parts

We've already learned how antagonists, protagonists, extras, and philosophies exist in stories. There are several more elements we need to learn to help extras make their choice.

Items: are the props, of the story. Broom sticks, magic hats, shoes, clothes, houses. Sleds, cars, animals, custumes; any material thing whether special effects or real, are items. Put them all together and items make the setting, like ancient Rome, galactic space, as suburb, or the ever-changing Eden.

Think stormtroopers in _Star Wars_, or the people stuck inside the _The Matrix_, or the French villagers in _Beauty and the Beast_. Extras, whether props or people in a story only get meaning when someone has gifts them passion. Thereafter they start to come alive.

Passion: Items come alive when somebody gives them passion. Think of the American flag waving overtop Philadelphia, or the wedding ring on your figure, or the Nobel prize so many scientists dream about. Just items, until someone feels passion about them.

People fight for their passions. Things like a guitar to a guitarist, a gun to a soldier, a stove to a baker, or a Wikipedia edit to a educator. As a person's passion is actualized with items, that person also becomes less of an extra and more of a character. Characters with passion, promote and defend their passions in their dialogue.

Dialogue: is the powerful words, whether written of spoken, between characters fighting for their passions. Dialogue is how characters communicate, like Hugh telling Sophia teaching a slave to read is bad. Dialogue is authority. The ruling philosophy polices itself with dialogie. Think of all the words you can't say at a red or blue rally. Like "higher taxes are good!" or "Immigrants are bad!"

## APPLICATIONS

Let's see what the full triangle looks like.

![The Matrix](img\thewriter\triangle-the-matrix.png)
**The Matrix:**  The perfect example for us. The story is about machines that enslave humanity, and keep us inside a virtual prison called The Matrix.  The real world is a dystopia, were people are power generators for the machines. The items of the story are 1999 western society, and a dystopia setting. The passions are human emotions empowering individuals against slavery. Dialogue is very human vs machine. The antagonist machine leader wants to preserve the slaver. The philosophy is to keep people in slavery for their own, and machines, good. The protagonist Neo slowly realizes ways to master The Matrix's philosophy and overpowers the ignorant antagonists. The plot is about cutting the cord that lets the machines control human prisoners.

![Star War](\../img\thewriter\triangle-star-wars.png)
**Star Wars:** An entire galaxy is controlled by a evil Empire. Evildoers keep control with their superweapon Death Star. Meagre resistance fighters stole its schematics and might find a weakness. The items are space ships, and alien planets. Passions are forces bewteen the Light and Dark Sides. Dialogue reinforces the do or die battle. The antagonist is Darth Vader who needs to save the Death Star to keep the Dark Side on top of the eternal philosophy battle between Light and Dark Sides. The protagonist Luke slowly realizes how to master the Light Side and become strong enough to defeat Darth Vader. The plot concludes when Luke shoots a missle and destroys the Death Star.

![Argh](\../img\thewriter\triangle-office-space.png)
**Office Space:**  This is a story about modern life. Items is everything from a condo, to car, to a cubicle. Passions are the desire for a better, more interesting life. Dialogue is the passive aggressive rules of doing what your boss says, regardless of how stupid it is. The antagonist is the boss who grinds his employess. Philosophy is the drive for profits of corporations who the boss services. The protagonist is the guy who says fuck it, I can't stand this bullshit. And the plot, is getting the money to quit.

This is what an extra must see through, in order to make their choice. How do they learn the difference?

## Charting Stories

What does a healthy story, its events, philosophies, characters, and items, work together.

Here's a legend.

![Legend](\../img\thewriter\story-legend.png)

**Old Society** - The society before the story starts.

**Beginning** - When the protagonist breaks from society.

**Protagonist philosophy** - The good guy acts out his philosophy.

**Antagonist philosophy** -  The bad guy acts out his philosophy.

**Realizations** -  Moments when a character sees a new reality.

**Plot** - The collection of actions of all characters.

**Suffering of the Protagonist** - Long periods when the protagonists suffers.

**Reversal of Situations** - Short periods where the plot changes big time.

**Free will** - The time allowed where the character can decide how to respond to plot events. Bigger spreads mean more options.

**Conclusion** - Convergence of plot and character to decide the result of the story.

**New Society** - The result of the battle between protagonist and antagonist. Regardless who wins, they effected each other, and the new reality's philosophy will be different.

This is the how story's look like. We'll map out the fight over new tools soon. First we have to see the three difference kinds of stories we'll encounter.

## Three Kings of Stories

There are three kinds of stories. One that works, and two that don't for different reasons. This will help us see the trends history, and our rising, and failing ruling philosophies.

![Functional Story](\../img\thewriter\story-functional.png)
*Functional:* Story elements are well ordered. The story is about an explicit problem. The protagonist wants to change something, and the antagonist doesn't. Both have strong wills and either might win. Both have distinct passions and thoughts that bind them, making them a believable person. As protagonist and antagonist battle, they make a logical yet surprising plot.

The events of the plot continually challenge the character to make decisions, decisions which reveal the character of the character. That is why the separation between plot and character is healthy. Protagonist experiences reversal of situations, suffering, and realizations.  Because it's a functional story the audience cares about the story and its characters. Ex. Cinderella, Shawshank Redemption, Star Wars, Pixar, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, etc.

![Art Story](\../img\thewriter\story-art.png)
**Art:** Story elements are disordered. Character personalites are emphasized over plot. The story doesn't have an explicit problem. Thus, art stories emphasize character's passions, and are less stories than personal diaries as a character discovers their loves, likes, hobbies, and interests. Since there is no battle between protagonist and antagonist, the plot is often illogical and inconsequential. The separation between plot and character is wide. Since the plot isn't about a problem, it can't be anticipated. There is little audience investment unless a viewer has the same passion as the characters like "youth angst" or "feeling different". The conclusion doesn't change the original reality very much. Art stories do not survive the test of history. They do not pass into archetype status. Ex. "The Cinema", Snow Angels, Wrecked, Spanglish, many Sundance, and TIFF films, etc.

![Spectacle Story](\../img\thewriter\story-spectacle.png)
**Spectacle:** Story elements are disordered. The story is about an obvious problem like the world is ending, or a big bomb will explode. Protagonist and antagonist fight over the problem, but since the problem is blatant, the plot is direct. There is no room for characters to choose their next steps. Character actions are instinctual because everyone runs from an explosion,  or a horror villian, or running from an even bigger explosion!

Spectacle stories emphasize items and effects. The story is about how the protagonist wins, not if. The audience isn't engaged with reversal of situations, suffering of the protagonist, and realizations. Since the plot can't be surprising, its conclusion is logical and never in doubt. Strict spectacle stories are meaningless. They do not survive the test of history. Ex. Transformers 1-8, Star Wars 1-3 / 7-9, most sequels and remakes.

**Conclusion:** Art stories don't have a real beginning. Since they aren't about a specific problem they could start at any moment. Spectacle stories have a beginning but are about fighting for survival and not fighting for a new reality. Only functional stories have real beginnings. Because functional stories have a protagonist fighting to replace a reality with their own.

Likewise, only functional stories have conclusions. Conclusions require mixing two proposed realities and making a new one. Conclusions are also where plot and character share importance. Because at the conclusion the characters actions are so important, they directly affect the plot.

Conclusions are where characters control history. Will Luke join his father in the Dark Side of the Force? This is why we remember the giants of history of Galileo, Napoleon, and Douglass, because they, like Luke, Frodo, and Belle, acted at the decisive moment of a conclusion. They created a new reality.

![After the story ends](\../img/thewriter/distribution-star_wars.png)
_Fun time is over. When a functional story ends, everything is effected by the new realtiy, but is no longer ordered inside Aristotle's story elements. Until a new story comes along to give them a purpose again. The triangle will look different when it reforms._

And this is the important part. Very important. Crucial part. What happens after conclusions. All story elements, all characters, all items and thoughts, return to being equal. The plot that bound them is over, and thus each returns to being an equal. Waiting for a new story to give them life and purpose.

For example, in _Star Wars_ Once the Death Star is blown up, Luke is no longer the protagonist, Vader isn't the antagonist, Light Side defeated the Dark side, dialogue isn't controlled by the need to destroy/save the Death Star, passions can follow something else, and items are just things again. The hierarchy becomes a circle in a time of equality.

Importantly, since spectacle and art stories don't have stories, they can't have conclusions. So they continue growing indefinitely. Thus art is followed with more art, and spectacle is followed with more spectacle. They never end.

And that's what Rousseau noticed. That society was past due its moment of conclusion, and as a result, it was living in a philosophy of art, to justify it's non-functioning society.

Let's draw it out.
