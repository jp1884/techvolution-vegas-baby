# CHAPTER SIX - THE WRITER

## The Writer

If we're going to master the human story, but proactively changing to its twists and turns via techvolution, we should understand how our story is written because by deconstructing stories, we'll understand our own.

## The Nature of Storytelling

A story is a protagonist fighting to solve a problem an antagonist defends. They fight in three parts. The first is an introduction to the problem and characters. The second is the battle between good and bad sides. The third part ist he conclusoin, where we find out which side will win. Both the characters and the viewers enjoy, or dread, the drama of not knowing which side will win.

So, Cinderella wants to go to the ball to have fun, and her evil step-family doesn’t want her to. Both main characters and their supporters fight whether she'll go and live a happier life,  until the conclusion, where we find out which side will win. Will the glass slipper fit Cinderella or an evil step-sister? Oh the drama, because whoever has the perfect fit, gets to marry the prince!

In good storytelling, be it fairy tale, romance, or comedy, the sequence of events must be unexpected enough to be interesting, yet logical enough to be believable. Balancing the two is the art of good storytelling.

So, we watch and read stories to be surprised. At the same time, we need the story to be logical to a certain extent. That means every story element, plot, backstory, dialogue etc. needs a reason to exist, even if we don’t initially understand it while watching the movie. And here’s the connection with techvolution. Because understanding all the reasoning hidden in stories, helps us understand all the reasoning hidden in our society.

Life is a story full of problems, from finding water to understanding calculus. And life solves problems with technology. Technology is thus the goal of characters in real life. We’re seeking the glass slipper that will solve our problems. We dig a well to get water, or watch a YouTube video to understand calculus. An invented technology is a problem solved, letting us move onto to a new problem and a new story.

So let's understand our live, but understanding stories teach our minds to master the different ways of life inside our foreign cities, mythical worlds, and galaxies far far away, and help extras choose which story they'll support.

## Story Parts

We've already learned how antagonists, protagonists, extras, and philosophies exist in stories. There are several more elements we need to learn to help extras make their choice.

Items: are the props, of the story. Broom sticks, magic hats, houses. Sleds, cars, animals, custumes; any material thing whether special effects or real, are items. Put them all together and items make the setting, like ancient Rome, galactic space, as suburb, or the ever-changing Eden.

Think stormtroopers in _Star Wars_, or the people stuck inside the _The Matrix_. Extras, whether props or people in a story only get meaning when someone has gifts them passion. Thereafter they start to come alive.

Passion: Items come alive when somebody gives them passion. Think of the American flag waving overtop Philadelphia, or the wedding ring on your figure, or the Nobel prize so many scientists dream about. Just items, until someone feels passion about them.

People fight for their passions, like guitarist for his guitar, a gun to a soldier, or  Wikipedia to an educator. As a person's passion is actualized with items, that person also becomes less of an extra and more of a character. Characters with passion, promote and defend their passions in their dialogue.

Dialogue: is the powerful words, whether written of spoken, between characters fighting for their passions. Dialogue is how characters communicate, like Hugh telling Sophia teaching a slave to read is bad. Dialogue is authority. The ruling philosophy polices itself with dialogie. Think of all the words you can't say at a red or blue rally. Like "higher taxes are good!" or "Immigrants are bad!".

Because once an idea is spoken, it can spread and become politcal. Tyrants start by controlling the speech. They fall first in the words. Like Rousseau, who was dangerous because he wrote good dialogue.

Antagonist: defends the society against the protagonists changes. They use items, passions, and dialogue to do it. However, since an antagonist defends the stories problem, he's bound by the society's ruling philosophy.

Ruling philosphy: is the philosophy that sets society's rules. Like the "Dark Side" controlling the empire in _Star Wars_. The ruling philosophy isn't created in the story. It already exists. Inside this cave is the reality most people live inside. Ruling philosoph is how the society acts together to solve problems. The ruling philosophy so powerful it controls anyone not a protagonist.

Protagonist: the rulebreakers who see a problem with the ruling philosophy, and fight to replace it with a new one. Like Luke Skywalker who attacks the Dark Side, with the Light Side. That's why the protagonist is the story's leader, whose success determines if society will change or not.

Plot: the series of battles between protagonist and antagonist. Usually the plot, and the battles, is about a tool whose creation, or destruction, determines the winner of the story. If Luke Skywalker destroys the Death Star in _Star Wars_, the Light Side wins. Or if the glass slipper in _Cinderella_, fits the protagonists, then she, not her evil step sisters, will live happily ever after.

## APPLICATIONS

Let's see what the full triangle looks like.

![The Matrix](img\thewriter\triangle-the-matrix.png)
**The Matrix:** The story is about machines that enslave humanity inside a virtual prison that looks like 1990's America. Humans are connected with a connection into our skulls. The real world is a dystopia, were people are power generators for the machines.

The antagonist machine leader likes the matrix, and defends the ruling philosophy of slavery. The protagonist Neo slowly realizes ways to master The Matrix's philosophy and overpowers the ignorant antagonists. The plot is about cutting the cord that lets the machines control human prisoners.

![Star War](\../img\thewriter\triangle-star-wars.png)
**Star Wars:** An entire galaxy is controlled by a evil Empire. Evildoers keep control with their superweapon Death Star. Meagre resistance fighters stole its schematics and might find a weakness. The antagonist is Darth Vader who needs to save the Death Star to keep the Dark Side on top of the eternal philosophy battle between Light and Dark Sides. The protagonist Luke slowly realizes how to master the Light Side and become strong enough to defeat Darth Vader. The plot depends of if Luke's missle will destroy the Death Star.

![Argh](\../img\thewriter\triangle-office-space.png)
**Office Space:**  Hits close to home, the story about the boring drugery of modern suburban life and office work. The ruling philosophy is commercialism that gives workers moderate repetitive tasks and keeps them in line with absurd office culture and just enough money to pay their bills. The antagonist is the boss who gets a disapproatio amount of money, prestige, and power.

The protagonist is the guy who values his freedom and relationships more then money. The plot rests on whether the protagonist will control the tool, money, to free himself from having to work anymore.

## The Extras

This triangle represents every story, and thus every society. Starting from items, passions, dialogue, antagonists, ruling philosophy, and plot/tool. This is what an extra must see through, in order to make their choice.

Now we have to teach ourselves the difference?

## Charting Stories

What does a healthy story, its events, philosophies, characters, and items, work together.

Here's a legend.

![Legend](\../img\thewriter\story-legend.png)

**Old Society** - The society before the story starts.

**Beginning** - When the protagonist breaks from society.

**Protagonist philosophy** - The good guy acts out his philosophy.

**Antagonist philosophy** -  The bad guy acts out his philosophy. The two philosophies balance out until the conclusion decides who wins.

**Realizations** -  Moments when a character realizes something.

**Suffering of the Protagonist** - Long periods when the protagonists suffers.

**Reversal of Situations** - When the plot changes big time.

**Free will** - The time allowed where the character can decide how to respond to plot events. Short spread means less choices, bigger spreads mean more options.

**Conclusion** - Convergence of plot and character to decide the result of the story.

**New Society** - The result of the battle.

This is the how story's look like. We'll map out the fight over new tools soon. First we have to see the three difference kinds of stories we'll encounter.

## Three Kings of Stories

There are three kinds of stories. One that works, and two that don't for different reasons. This will help us see the trends history, and our rising, and failing ruling philosophies.

![Functional Story](\../img\thewriter\story-functional.png)
*Functional:* Story elements are well ordered. The story is about an explicit problem. The protagonist wants to change something, and the antagonist doesn't. Both have strong wills and either might win. Both have distinct passions and thoughts that bind them, making them a believable person. As protagonist and antagonist battle, they make a logical yet surprising plot.

The events of the plot continually challenge the character to make decisions, decisions which reveal the character of the character. That is why the separation between plot and character is healthy. Protagonist experiences reversal of situations, suffering, and realizations.  Because it's a functional story the audience cares about the story and its characters. Ex. Cinderella, Shawshank Redemption, Star Wars, Pixar, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, etc.

![Art Story](\../img\thewriter\story-art.png)
**Art:** Story elements are disordered. Character personalites are emphasized over plot. The story doesn't have an explicit problem. Thus, art stories emphasize character's passions, and are less stories than personal diaries as a character discovers their loves, likes, hobbies, and interests. Since there is no battle between protagonist and antagonist, the plot is often illogical and inconsequential. The separation between plot and character is wide. Since the plot isn't about a problem, it can't be anticipated. There is little audience investment unless a viewer has the same passion as the characters like "youth angst" or "feeling different". The conclusion doesn't change the original reality very much. Art stories do not survive the test of history. They do not pass into archetype status. Ex. "The Cinema", Snow Angels, Wrecked, Spanglish, many Sundance, and TIFF films, etc.

![Spectacle Story](\../img\thewriter\story-spectacle.png)
**Spectacle:** Story elements are disordered. The story is about an obvious problem like the world is ending, or a big bomb will explode. Protagonist and antagonist fight over the problem, but since the problem is blatant, the plot is direct. There is no room for characters to choose their next steps. Character actions are instinctual because everyone runs from an explosion,  or a horror villian, or running from an even bigger explosion!

Spectacle stories emphasize items and effects. The story is about how the protagonist wins, not if. The audience isn't engaged with reversal of situations, suffering of the protagonist, and realizations. Since the plot can't be surprising, its conclusion is logical and never in doubt. Strict spectacle stories are meaningless. They do not survive the test of history. Ex. Transformers 1-8, Star Wars 1-3 / 7-9, most sequels and remakes.

**Conclusion:** Art stories don't have a real beginning. Since they aren't about a specific problem they could start at any moment. Spectacle stories have a beginning but are about fighting for survival and not fighting for a new reality. Only functional stories have real beginnings. Because functional stories have a protagonist fighting to replace a reality with their own.

Likewise, only functional stories have conclusions. Conclusions require mixing two proposed realities and making a new one. Conclusions are also where plot and character share importance. Because at the conclusion the characters actions are so important, they directly affect the plot.

Conclusions are where characters control history. Will Luke join his father in the Dark Side of the Force? This is why we remember the giants of history of Galileo, Napoleon, and Douglass, because they, like Luke, Frodo, and Belle, acted at the decisive moment of a conclusion. They created a new reality.

![After the story ends](\../img/thewriter/distribution-star_wars.png)
_Fun time is over. When a functional story ends, everything is effected by the new realtiy, but is no longer ordered inside Aristotle's story elements. Until a new story comes along to give them a purpose again. The triangle will look different when it reforms._

And this is the important part. Very important. Crucial part. What happens after conclusions. All story elements, all characters, all items and thoughts, return to being equal. The plot that bound them is over, and thus each returns to being an equal. Waiting for a new story to give them life and purpose.

For example, in _Star Wars_ Once the Death Star is blown up, Luke is no longer the protagonist, Vader isn't the antagonist, Light Side defeated the Dark side, dialogue isn't controlled by the need to destroy/save the Death Star, passions can follow something else, and items are just things again. The hierarchy becomes a circle in a time of equality.

Importantly, since spectacle and art stories don't have stories, they can't have conclusions. So they continue growing indefinitely. Thus art is followed with more art, and spectacle is followed with more spectacle. They never end.

## Small example

Taking what we've learned, let's apply the full triangle, and a spectacle, functional, and art story to the creation and distribution of new tools.

Spectacle is how tools are first made. Basically we toy with new technology, making toys of it, trying to figure out what it can do. Spectacle works best here because it's easy and cheap. Pornography was one of the first book topics printed, and online pornography quickly spread on the early world wide web.

After toying around, we learn what the tool is capable of, and start applying it to real world problems. Here a new tool enters the functional stage. Where protagonists question society, and continually break the rules to push society forward.

Then comes the third stage, art. A new tool only has so much function to give. Eventually it's used up. Thereafter it's owners resort to art. The tool gets more decorative, ornamental, and personal.

Here's what it looks like on our diagrams of new tools.

![After the story ends](\../img\thewriter\techvolution-story-types-applied.png)

And that's what Rousseau noticed. That society was past due its moment of conclusion. That instead of protagonists becoming equal again, and distributing the proceeds of a new tool throughout society, the leaders descendants kept it for themselves.

And that is Darth King responsible holding back upgrades by using his control of the ruling philosophy to extra more power and money of so many of society's new tools for himself. The result was opulancent houses made into palaces, playing exquisite music, during very many banquets and balls. All the while society was increasingly non-functioning, behind it's potential.

Until a poor write made the extras realize their inaction was to blame, and wrote magic words to make them realize it. Let's find out how this story, and ours, happened in Wester Civilization, by looking at our backstory.
