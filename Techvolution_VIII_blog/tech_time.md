# Does Everybody Know What Time It Is? Tool Time!

### Introduction

In the 1990s, Home Improvement was one of America's most popular shows, a sitcom about Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor, host of a cable TV home repair show called "Tool Time", and his family's suburban life outside Detroit.

The show celebrated tools. Tim constantly reviewed new power tools, taught viewers home repairs, and famously proclaimed "More power!" while demonstrating the latest equipment. Tim also brought this love to his house, family, and local hardware store.

Yet Tim and the rest of the characters remained completely oblivious to the most important tool in the Taylors' lives: the cable television technology that paid for everything.

That technology had a lifecycle that was soon to end. Cable TV's golden age was already ending while Home Improvement aired from 1991-1999, as internet streaming began its inevitable displacement of broadcast media. The Taylor's life had a fuse attached to it they never saw.

But the family never acknowledged this. Tim reviewed every new drill and saw from his sponsor Binford Tools, but never noticed the technological wave his family was riding or that it was cresting.

This blindness isn't unique to a fictional sitcom. It's how most of us relate to technology: we use tools constantly while remaining oblivious to the technological ecosystems those tools inhabit, evolve within, and eventually exit. In previous posts, I've called the mindset needed to see these patterns "biologists for humans" understanding our technological world with the same systematic awareness biologists bring to natural ecosystems.

Home Improvement offers a perfect case study in what happens when we lack that awareness.

### The Show

Most of us know all about the premise of the show. So if you do, you can move ahead. But if not, Home Improvement was a beloved American sitcom during the 1990s. Starring Tim Allen as Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor, the show centered around a local home improvement television show host and his family, blending comedy with relatable family dynamics. 

Tim hosted the fictional "Tool Time" program, alongside his good-natured co-host Al Borland. The pair taught basic home repairs while highlighting their sponsor's Binford Tools products. Al was a quiet and competent sidekick while Tim loved to try novel techniques that rarely work but was entertaining to watch.

At home, Tim was married to Jill Taylor, a patient, intelligent, and flawed wife, who often served as the voice of reason to Tim's wild antics. Their three sons-Brad, Randy, and Mark-showcased the challenges and joys of raising energetic, rapscallion boys with different personalities and abilities.

The Taylors' next-door neighbor Wilson was a source of wisdom, often giving advice and philosophical insights that helped resolve the episode's conflicts between Tim, Jill, their sons, friends, and co-workers. The show became known for its running gags, including Tim's catchphrase "More power!" and his ability to accidentally injure himself or those around him while on his show or working on home improvement projects.

The name Home Improvement was a metaphor that both home and family are ever a work in progress but always worth putting in the extra effort to keep them going.

That's why the show was more than just a comedy; it was a snapshot of 1990s American family life that resonated with tens of millions of people. It was always in the "Top Ten" in the ratings during its 1991 to 1999 run. And its over 200 episodes are still popular in broadcasting syndication and streaming sites. 

And, watching the show I couldn't help but notice the seeds of the discord and confusion America suffers today, most easily seen with the growing divide between Conservatives and Progressives, and what America could be with more technological self-awareness via "biologist for humans".

### Unspoken Future

_Video Killed The Radio Star_ 
_Released: 1980_

Home Improvement did not exist in a hypothetical universe. It was a regular suburb in 1990s America. The Taylors lived outside of Detroit, Michigan, but could very well have been in Indiana, Washington, or California.

Filled with suburban houses, hot rods, consumer goods, high-school drama, first jobs, and layoffs, the life and times of the Taylors was about an average life for everyone in America. 

Let's see what was going on behind the scenes so to speak, in the technological trends of an evolving ecosystem. This evolution enriched the Taylors while they never knew, or cared to acknowledge, its limited shelf-life.

This chart shows the development of new telecommunication technologies. Each line is a new technology that came to market, its speed at moving data, and the estimated time it would take to send/receive one minute of Standard Definition (480p) video.

| Year      | Medium                         | Digital-Equivalent (Mbps)              | 1 Min Video (≈10 MB) |
| --------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1940s     | AM Radio (audio equivalent)    | ~0.04 (40 kbps)                        | ≈33 min              |
| 1950s-70s | Analog TV broadcast (SD video) | ~3–4 (compressed SD-equivalent)        | ≈20–27 sec           |
| 1980s     | Analog Cable TV (SD video)     | ~5 (compressed SD-equivalent)          | ≈16 sec              |
| 1990s     | Dial-up Internet               | 0.056 (56 kbps peak)                   | ≈24 min              |
| 2000s     | Consumer broadband (DSL/cable) | ~1–10 (typical)                        | ≈8–67 sec            |
| 2010s     | Fiber to the home              | 100–1000                               | ≈0.8–8 sec           |
| 2010s-20s | 4G / LTE mobile data           | ~10–100 (typical LTE user range)       | ≈0.8–8 sec           |
| 2020s     | High-end cable/fiber access    | 1000–5000 (1–5 Gbps high-end tiers)    | ≈0.16–0.8 sec        |

* Approximations of “One minute of video” uses a common SD (480p) rate for equivalence.

From the 1940s to today saw a huge increase in telecommunication. There were similar huge gains in the speed and storage capacity of physical video media. Going from the magnetic tape technology of VHS to the optical and digital technology of DVD and Blu-Ray saw a big increase in storage capacity and audio visual quality.

Physical Media Storage Capacity
| Decade | Medium  | Typical Capacity        | SD Hrs | HD Hrs      |
| ------ | ------- | ----------------------- | ------ | ------------|
| 1980s  | VHS     | 1.4 GB (per tape at SP) | ~2     | N/A         |
| 1990s  | DVD     | 4.7 GB (single-layer)   | ~2     | ~0.5 (480p) |
| 2000s  | Blu-ray | 25 GB (single-layer)    | ~13    | ~2   (1080p)|
| 2010s+ | Blu-ray | 50 GB (dual-layer)      | ~26    | ~4.5 (1080p)|

* SD and HD video hours are approximations.

All of these increases in telecommunications and storage capacity meant much change in houses throughout America. Not only could companies record, store, and communicate more information to customers. But homes gradually got ever more powerful devices themselves. These big evolutionary jumps in ability are worthy of Tim Taylor's famous tagline "More Power!".

Perhaps we should say "Moore Power!" as it was doubling of transistor density in microchips (known as Moore's Law), that fueled most of these startling gains from the 1970s onwards, especially as more powerful computers can compress and decompress video content making the most of each telecommunication technology.

What all these technological improvements mean is that as the years went by, Americans got more information broadcasted, beamed, or streamed their way. Thus, the channel options available to users grew at an incredible rate.

| Era/Decade  | Medium               | Typical Channels Accessible to Creators      |
| ----------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------|
| 1940s       | AM/FM Radio          | 40–100 (local and regional stations)         |
| 1940s–1960s | Broadcast TV         | 3–6 (usually major networks in large cities) |
| 1970s       | Broadcast TV         | 5–15 (expansion and local stations)          |
| 1980s       | Cable TV             | 30–60+ (large metro areas sometimes had 80)  |
| 1990s       | Cable TV             | 60–100+ (premium and niche channels grow)    |
| 1990s       | Satellite TV         | 150–200 (direct broadcast systems emerge)    |
| 2000s       | Digital Cable/Sat    | 200–500+                                     |
| 2010s–2020s | Internet Streaming   | Unlimited (YouTube: millions; Twitch, etc.)  |

While the number of channels increased from 1940s to 1990s, the technology was still quite limited. Customers of broadcast, cable, or satellite technologies received what was sent with only a relatively minor increase in options to choose their content and no ability to upload their own (unless they impressed the many layers of people controlling broadcasting and sponsors and got their own show on television, a task Tim Taylor often had to do).

But come the 2010s, the internet was so fast people could watch anything they wanted, and upload anything they wanted. While broadcast/cable/satellite is a one-way radio, the internet is a two-way radio that lets everyone communicate when and how they want.

The results were predictable.

For any younger generation, Blockbuster was a physical store that people paid about six dollars to rent a VHS or DVD for a few days. If the customer was late in returning the rental, there was a late charge, and with only so many physical media, what was in stock and available to rent was always uncertain.

Blockbuster used the internet to tell when their store hours and also what was in stock. But did not rent videos for online streaming. Once online streaming was technically possible and offered to the public, people flocked away from DVD purchases and rentals, as they did to other new technologies.

Now, what does all this technological progress have to do with Home Improvement? It depends how important you think tools are to our lives and on how much awareness you think a person should have about what new technology is coming.

Do you think Jill and Tim Taylor should be aware of these telecommunication trends? Yes, because there is a lot they could do to master their fate, the most important is being safe from today's rampant misdirection.

## Today and Tomorrow

A recurring lesson the Taylor family learned was that they had a pretty good life. The parents were around 35 years old with three healthy kids, one working parent, a suburban home with two cars, hot rods, a parent in grad school, and everyone did loads of shopping. That life would be pretty satisfactory to a lot of people. 

Yet, the vast majority of the family income is based on a snapshot in time. 

In the early 1990s cable technology was beaming hundreds of channels to an audience used to having only several broadcast channels. "Cable TV" was new and filled with so many novel news, shows, movies, and how-to options people paid a premium to sit in their couches and watch it. For example, when the Cable News Network, CNN, sent live images of the 1991 American bombing of Iraq, it was revolutionary and transfixed Americans. 

In retrospect cable shows had a decade of premium attention with a marked loss of audience as American homes got broadband internet access.

Predicting streaming’s rise wasn’t easy in the early 1990s. The internet was around, but most people were still on 56k modems, which meant downloading a single minute of video could take more than ten hours. Netflix and YouTube didn’t exist yet. 

Even so, the signs were there.

Just look at how silent movie stars were challenged, and often replaced, by the introduction of "talkies". Classic movie _Singing In The Rain_ shows this transition very well. Classic song "Video Killed The Radio Star" shows how technological progress again replaced stars from one medium with another.

And here was computing power doubling every two years. Telecommunications speeds were climbing fast in the 1990s. Cable had already overtaken broadcast within a generation. Anyone paying attention to how technology evolves could see that faster transmission would eventually make video-on-demand possible, and once that happened, streaming would beat scheduled cable programming as talking movies, video had done already. 

No one could predict the exact companies or tools, only the direction. The Taylors didn’t need to foresee Netflix. They only needed to understand that the tech behind Tim’s paycheck belonged to a shifting ecosystem rather than a fixed landscape.

This is the contrast between thinking “I work in television” and thinking “I work in a field shaped by a temporary stage in telecom history.” One sees current technology as permanent. The other recognizes it as a wave that eventually moves on. 

With this mindset, who couldn't see big changes coming? 

After all, the Taylors get themselves a satellite dish, buy new laptops, get cell phones. Tim routinely reviews new and more powerful tools. Yet the fact the family's fortunes are tied to this technological development is not known.

I'll leave it to the reader to note the current viewing habits of Americans on broadcast TV and cable subscriptions, but increasingly on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and Twitch. So do you think the Taylors should have been aware of what lies ahead? A quick YouTube search showcases thousands of on-demand videos of everything Tool Time showed. Today millions of creators are scrambling to find sponsors and attract clicks.  

There are definitely people still watching broadcast and cable television. But the trend is a clear movement to streaming. ABC, CBS, NBC, even PBS whose "This Old House" is what Tool Time is based on, are all cutting back. 

Yet, this time bomb is never talked about. Most interestingly, not even when Tim quits Tool Time and doesn't know what he'll do for money.

## Ignorance Is Not Bliss

The series ends with Tim quitting Tool Time. A new producer had taken over and tried to cash in on a craze for crude reality television. Soon, the producer insists Tim start an electrical fire on purpose. True to his message of home improvement the Tool Man quits instead.

Now without a job, the Taylor's wonder what they will do for money.

Tim thinks he can open a custom car shop with the practical minded Jill saying established businesses will be hard to dislodge in such a niche market. Jill has a job offer but its out of town and for less money.

This moment of uncertainty is what internet streaming was eventually going to put the Taylor's in. And the Taylor's aren't ready.

Important to note, the family was never ridicules. The job did a great job of showing a realistic middle-class family. They stayed in the same house since 1979, made more space in the basement and attic when needed to avoid "upgrading" to a bigger house. Tim built his hobby cars instead of buying them. Most important, Jill worked hard and was now a therapist with job offers. 

The point is its not like the family squandered their good fortune, bought a Bentley and vacationed in Bora Bora instead of Michigan's scenic north peninsula.

Yet still, they weren't ready. Like anyone they should have been more prepared with more savings and more second source of incomes in case of surprises such as sickness, recessions, or job losses.

But the problems run deeper because America didn't act like the Taylor's. It was far worse.

Here are the trends. First off, the average size of the American family went down. In 1960, there was 1.43 people under the age of 18 living in the household. In 1975, it was 1.13, and in 2023, the number was 0.85.

Meanwhile, houses got bigger. In 1979, when the Taylor's bough their home, the average square foot of a new USA house was about 1700. In 2000, when they left their home and decided to go to Indiana for Jill's job, the average size was 2,200. Today the number is around 2,700.

That means the Americans were paying 580 to 1050 square foot person. Here's a graph to showcase it all.

<!-- AEIdeas -->

And wages did not grow, so there's a cost of living crisis. With home affordability being the biggest culprit. This study uses a price-to-income ratio that divides the median house price by the median household income. As late as about 1990, national price-to-income ratios were “affordable,” as houses cost 3.0 times the amount of household income in the United States. Now the number is double or triple that metric because personal income rose only a partial amount of that increase.

Here's the rise in incomes compared to the rise in home prices.

<!-- graphic-->

Public policies wonks, ideologues, and many others will have a host of policies, platforms, and people to blame. Perhaps green belts restrict land too much, or investment banks buy up too much rental properties, or there is too much, or too little, immigration allowed.

Yet, the problem is worldwide. Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and many other countries share Americans cost of living crisis. Each has tried multiple of ideologies, policies, and there are lessons and ideas to be shared, but surely such a universal problem suggests a deeper cause.

The real answer is we need a "biologist for humans" to understand the newfound technological ecosystem we find ourselves in.

We each are, like a regional cable TV show host, dependant on an era of technological development. It follows the rules of evolution with a lifecycle is independent from our own. Although we do things like buy huge houses to house less people while making less money and wonder why our lives are so expensive, evolution takes notice. 

Never mind pointing out the Taylor's not realizing internet streaming is coming. History has far worse in mind for a people who refuse to evolve their way of life. Our identity, ideologues, and economics does not acknowledge it.

To showcase our erroneous mindset, here's an quote from economist Paul Krugman made in 1998.

> "The growth of the Internet will slow drastically, as the flaw in "Metcalfe's law"—which states that the number of potential connections in a network is proportional to the square of the number of participants—becomes apparent: most people have nothing to say to each other! By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine's."

## The Taylor Hunted and Gathered, they needed to Plant and Wait

Krugman has written countless works, both in newspaper Op-Eds, popular books, and academic papers. He even won a Nobel Price. It's okay one of his many predictions was wrong. The problem is not a wrong prediction, the problem is that this perspective is completely wrong.

Heck, talk to any insurance claims adjuster and you'll get endless stories about how much people need to speak. Not because we like gossip or sports scores, but because we are each now property managers over houses, cars, electronics, health and so much more in our complex technological ecosystem.

So what should the Taylor's do? Be prepared for surprises including job losses. When technology does transform your job, do not think ideological purity (that has captured many Americans since digital technology arrived in the 1970s) will save you.

Like any source of knowledge, the Taylors' should seek to understand the future and master the trends that are taking us there.

At this time in history, technological evolution is the force of nature that determines our futures. Doing otherwise is like predicting the location of planets without knowing what gravity is.

You might have heard about hunter-gatherers. If you've ever gotten lost in a forest you may have experienced a hint of our ancestors' lifestyle. 

Hunting-gathering represented the primary survival mode for most of our species' existence. They followed food sources, developed some tools and hunting techniques, and maintained a deep, symbiotic relationship with their natural surroundings. They got nothing that wasn't hunted or found and came up with stories to explain the stars, seasons, and where to find the best hunting grounds.

They deeply integrated with and dependent on natural systems, but didn't look to master it until we planted it for ourselves.

There's debate about why humans even did so. It takes many generations of planting to get more food from early agriculture than simply getting it from nature. Regardless of why, once agriculture took hold, it started cities, roads, and other hallmarks of civilization.

This analogy isn't exact, but we have so little understanding and appreciation of the technological ecosystem, we are not unlike hunter-gatherers of the biological world. Like the Taylors, we happen across technology and do not know for how long it will provide us a paycheck.

And when it doesn't we interpret our misfortune using our stories and not the realities of evolution.

A biologist for humans will help do for our future, what the agriculture transition did for us before. 

Because the same principles apply. Speciation, natural and artificial selection, co-evolution and many more forces are at play under our noses. To learn more about how to plant and cultivate the new technological ecosystems to everyone's benefit, please read Techvolution.

Families in the United States
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, a family is a group of two people or more (one of whom is the householder) related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together; all such people (including related subfamily members) are considered as members of one family.

As of 2023, the U.S. Census Bureau counted about 84.33 million families in the United States. The average family consisted of 3.15 persons in 2021, down from 3.7 in the 1960s. This is reflected in the decrease of children in family households overall. In 1970, about 56 percent of all family households had children under the age of 18 living in the household. This percentage declined to about 40 percent in 2020.

Size of floor area in new single-family homes in the U.S. 1975-2024
Published by Statista Research Department, Aug 11, 2025
In 2024, the average size of a single-family home built for sale in the United States amounted to 2,407 square feet. Although in the past five years American homes have been shrinking, since 1975, they have almost doubled in size. This trend towards larger homes seems illogical given that the average size of families has shrunk over the same period.

Why are American homes so large?
Homes in the U.S. are among the largest in the world, only surpassed by Australia. There are thought to be several reasons for this, including the concentration of wealth in the country and the deeply engrained driving culture, which means that cheaper land outside city centers is easily accessible.

Where are the largest homes located?
The size of homes also varies regionally, with the largest homes being located in wealthy, urban areas and in the South. Large homes, or McMansions as they’re often called, are especially popular in Texas. In 2024, Milwaukee and Omaha had the largest average home size.

New US Homes Today Are 1,000 Square Feet Larger Than in 1973 and Living Space per Person Has Nearly Doubled
https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/new-us-homes-today-are-1000-square-feet-larger-than-in-1973-and-living-space-per-person-has-nearly-doubled/

1. Average/Median House Size. In 2015, the average size of new houses built in the US increased to an all-time high of 2,687 square feet (see dark blue line in top chart above), and the median size new house set a new record of 2,467 square feet (see light blue line in top chart). Over the last 42 years, the average new US house has increased in size by more than 1,000 square feet, from an average size of 1,660 square feet in 1973 (earliest year available from the Census Bureau) to 2,687 square feet last year. Likewise, the median-size house has increased in size by almost 1,000 square feet, from 1,525 square feet in 1973 to 2,467 last year. In percentage terms, both the average and median size of new US houses have increased by 62% since 1973.

2. Living Space per Person. While the average size of new US houses has increased over the last 42 years, the average household size has been declining over that period, from 3.01 persons per household on average in 1973 to a new record low of 2.54 persons per household in the last three years (2013, 2014 and 2015), a reduction of almost one-half persons per household over the last 42 years (see brown line in top chart).

With the average new house in the US getting larger in size at the same time that American households are getting smaller, the square footage of living space per person in a new US house has increased from 507 to 971 square feet using the median size house, and from 551 to 1,058 square feet using the average size house. In percentage terms, that’s a 92% increase for both the median or average house size per person. Amazingly, the average amount of living space per person in a new house has nearly doubled in just the last 42 years!

This chart shows trends in total vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in the United States (expressed as a moving 12-month count) from 1971 to 2023. The long rise in VMT has seen three periods of flattened growth or decline, triggered by the oil price spikes of 1974, 1979, and 2008. The VMT flattening that started in 2008 continued long after oil prices recovered, largely because of an economic recession. Starting in 2012, VMT began rising again largely because the U.S. economy recovered while petroleum prices remained relatively low. The rate of increase slowed between 2017 and 2020. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, VMT in 2021, which reflects February 2020 through January 2021, was the lowest since 2002. VMT hasn’t fully rebounded to pre-pandemic levels in part because of the increased number of remote workers.
