# Does Everybody Know What Time It Is? Tech Time!

### Intro

A few weeks ago I was getting ready for some exercise. This being a lifelong habit, I find background noise helps focus, so I tried the 1990s sitcom Home Improvement. I knew about it as a kid but never watched more than a few episodes. So, it was familiar enough to be easy to follow yet distant enough that it wouldn't be distracting.

After a few weeks, something caught my eye.

But first let's recap. In prior posts we discussed the idea that "biologists for humans" is a vantage point whereby humans are better understood by analyzing technology has an ecosystem unto itself, one that we co-evolve with and is subject to the rules of evolution just like biology is. When we track technological evolution we learn much about ourselves, especially our erroneous habit of thinking our stories and ideologies determine our fate and not the tools we use to shelter, feed, and do other required things. These tools have a lifecycle independent of our own that is an ecosystem under our feet.

As it turns out, Home Improvement is an easy way of seeing what "biologist for humans" means and how it could help us live better lives.

### The Show

Home Improvement was a beloved American sitcom during the 1990s. Starring Tim Allen as Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor, the show centered around a local home improvement television show host and his family, blending comedy with relatable family dynamics. 

Tim hosted the fictional "Tool Time" program, alongside his good-natured co-host Al Borland. At home, Tim was married to Jill Taylor, a patient and intelligent wife who often served as the voice of reason to Tim's wild antics. Their three sons-Brad, Randy, and Mark-showcased the challenges and joys of raising energetic, rapscallion boys.

The Taylors' next-door neighbor Wilson was a source of wisdom, often giving Tim advice and philosophical insights that helped resolve the episode's conflicts between Tim, Jill, their sons, friends, and co-workers. The show became known for its running gags, including Tim's catchphrase "More power!" and his ability to accidentally injure himself or those around him while on his show or working on home improvement projects.

Home improvement, of house and family, being a messy affair but worth undertaking is the constant message.

That's why Home Improvement was more than just a comedy; it was a snapshot of 1990s family life that resonated with audiences across America. It was always in the "Top Ten" in the ratings, getting tens of millions of viewers during its 1991 to 1999, and its over 200 epeidoes being popular on syndication. 

### Observations

So, Home Improvement was a stand sitcom of the 1990s. It mixed work and home life in a relatable way for millions of Americans. 

The show's storylines are fairly typical of television sitcoms. Jill's character is more complex then was common for TV house wives. She in intelligence and ambitious, getting a fact-checking job at a magazine and eventually her masters psychology on her way to becoming a therapist. She also makes mistakes and is challenged to improve herself. Tim is usually an oof but he loves his job and family and tries to learn how to communicate better with others. Each of their sons has their strength and weaknesses. Some being good at school, others being artistic, each learning to fail as an acceptable part of life.

Home Improvement featured memorable storylines that blended physical comedy with family dynamics. In one notable episode, Tim attempts to build a backyard gazebo, which quickly turns into a disaster when his overpowered tools and excessive enthusiasm lead to the structure collapsing spectacularly. The dishwasher, microwave, car, few things were safe from Tim's obsession with more power.

Family-centered episodes delved into more nuanced storytelling. In a memorable multi-episode arc, their eldest son Brad becomes interested in rock music and forms a band, creating tension with Tim, who struggles to understand his son's artistic pursuits. Another storyline explored middle son Randy's environmental activism, which challenged Tim's more traditional worldview. These episodes showcased the show's ability to address generational differences with both humor and genuine emotional depth.

The show also frequently incorporated heartfelt moments, such as episodes dealing with Tim and Jill's marriage challenges, career pressures, and the complexities of raising three sons. A particularly memorable storyline involved Tim's concern about potentially losing his show when asked to cut out his loveable co-host Al, a choice which explored his professional insecurities beneath his bombastic exterior.

Other serious storylines were his Tim's brother thinking of leaving his family, or having to placate a mean boss. These occasional serious moments balanced the show's slapstick comedy with genuine emotional storytelling, made Home Improvement more than just a simple sitcom about home repairs. It was a window into a family always trying to improve itself.

Watching the show I couldn't help but notice the seeds of what America is today and what it could be with more technological self-awareness via "biologist for humans".

### Tech status

Home Improvement did not exist in a hypothetical universe. It was a regular suburb so common in America. The Taylor's lived outside of Detroit Michigan, but could very well have been in Indiana, Washington, or California. And the same trends 

Let's look at those trends. 

This chart shows the development of new telecommunication technologies. It shows the decades a technology came to market, it's transport speed and the estimated time it would take to send/receive one minute of Standard Definition (480p) video.

| Year      | Medium       | Typical Max Speed (Mbps) | Time to Transfer 1 Min Video |
| --------- | ------------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| 1940s     | AM Radio     | 0.128 (128 kbps)         | ≈4.7 hours                   |
| 1950s-70s | TV Broadcast | 3-4 (analog equivalent)  | ≈8-12 min                    |
| 1980s     | Cable TV     | 5 (analog est.)          | ≈7 min                       |
| 1990s     | Internet     | 0.056 (56k modem)        | ≈10.7 hours                  |
| 1990s     | Cable Modem  | 27-38                    | ≈57-80 sec                   |
| 2000s     | Broadband    | 100+                     | ≈21 sec                      |
| 2010s     | Fiber        | 1000 (1 Gbps)            | ≈2 sec                       |
| 2020s     | DOCSIS 3.1+  | 10000 (10 Gbps)          | ≈0.2 sec                     |

* Approximations of “One minute of video” uses a common SD (480p) rate for equivalence.

Let's continue. There was similar huge gains the speed and storage capacity of physical video media. Going from the magnetic tape technology of VHS to the optical and digital technology of DVD and Blu-Ray saw a big increase in storage capacity and audio visual quality.


| Decade | Medium  | Typical Capacity        | SD Hrs | HD Hrs   |
| ------ | ------- | ----------------------- | ------ | -------- |
| 1980s  | VHS     | 1.4 GB (per tape at SP) | ~2     | N/A      |
| 1990s  | DVD     | 4.7 GB (single-layer)   | ~2     | ~0.5 (480p/576p) |
| 2000s  | Blu-ray | 25 GB (single-layer)    | ~13    | ~2 (1080p)       |
| 2010s+ | Blu-ray | 50 GB (dual-layer)      | ~26    | ~4.5 (1080p)     |

* SD and HD video hours are approximations.

All of these increases in telecommunications and storage capacity meant much change in houses throughout America. Starting with radio in the early 20th century, home gradually got ever more powerful devices. From the broadcast television of the 1940s to 1970s, then cable television and satellite of the 1990s and 2000s. Then the internet was fast enough to stream video.

What this all means is that ss the years went by, Americans got more information broadcasted, beamed, or streamed their way. The channel options grew at an incredible rate.

| Era/Decade  | Medium               | Typical Channels Accessible to Creators                     |
| ----------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1940s       | AM/FM Radio          | 40–100 (local and regional stations)                        |
| 1940s–1960s | Broadcast TV         | 3–6 (usually major networks in large cities)                |
| 1970s       | Broadcast TV         | 5–15 (mostly due to UHF expansion and local stations)       |
| 1980s       | Cable TV             | 30–60+ (rapid expansion—large metro areas sometimes had 80) |
| 1990s       | Cable TV             | 60–100+ (premium and niche channels grow)                   |
| 1990s       | Satellite TV         | 150–200 (direct broadcast systems emerge)                   |
| 2000s       | Digital Cable/Sat    | 200–500+                                                    |
| 2010s–2020s | Internet Streaming   | Unlimited (YouTube: millions; Twitch, etc.)                 |


The big change to notice is the internet. While the numbers increased going from 1940s but with broadcast, cable, or satellite technologies customers received what was sent. Come the 2010s, the internet was so fast people could watch anything they wanted, and upload anything they wanted. 

Broadcast/cable/satellite is a one-way radio. The internet is a way radio. The latter lets people communicate when and how they want.

The results were predictable. Here are the Google searches for Blockbuster, the largest video rental store, and Netflix the popular streaming service, between from Jan 1st 2004 to Jan 1st 2010. For any younger generation, Blockbuster was a physical store that people paid five dollars or so to rent a VHS or DVD for a few days. If the customer was late in returning the rental, there was a late charge, and with only so many physical media in stock it was common for new releases to be all gone. Technology has moved so fast it's already common for people to not know that.

Now, what does all this technological progress have to do with Home Improvement? It depends on much awareness you think a person should have, and how important technology evolution is to our future lives.

## America

The Taylor family had a pretty good life. Being 35 years old with three healthy kids, one working parent, a suburban home with two cars and loads of shopping. That life would be pretty satisfactory to a lot of people.

Yet, the vast majority of the family income is based on snapshot in time.

In the early 1990s cable technology was beaming hundreds of channels to an audience used to having only several broadcast channels. "Cable TV" was new and filled with so many news, shows, movies, and how-to options people paid a premium to sit in their couches and watch it. When Cable News Network, CNN, sent live images of the 1991 American bombing of Iraq, it was revolutionary and transfixed American.

So, the Taylor suburban home, the large yard, the cars, the stay-at-home mom, the rapskallen kids, all that was afford by Tim's job as a cable TV host. Yet, it was fleeting. In retrospect cable shows had a decade of premium attention with a loss of audience as home got broadband internet.

Who couldn't see this coming? Anyone who looked would know how much technology was speeding up telecommunications. Much of the increase was due to Moore's Law, the doubling of transistors every two years.

Things moved so fast, many young adults today won't understand there was a time that people only a few hundred YouTube channels to watch. Today millions of creators are scrambling to find sponsors and attract clicks. Tim Allen had a set, live audience, production crew, co-hosts, all paid for with a family home that he had the time and money to keep improving.

And yet, not once, does this time bomb get talked about.

I'll leave it to the reader to note the current viewing habit of Americas. And if, you could tell them, do you think the Taylor should be made aware of what lies ahead. There is definitely people still watching broadcast and cable television. But the trends is a clear movement to streaming. ABC, CBS, NBC, even PBS whose "This Old House" is what Tool Time is based on, are all cutting back intensely struggling to maintain their size, staff, and schedules.

Yet, from what I can see, the Taylor's were completely ignorant of that fact.

And this ignorance is fair, as the American public is ignorant of technological evolution changing our society. 

Instead we argue over our stories.

I had a feeling keeping popping up whilst watching Home Improvement; "Oh that's where it comes from". It felt like I was in a divorce proceedings watching a family's happy home videos. You see the hatred in the room and try to connect where at things all went wrong.

Now, I haven't watched every episode, but did watch many. Here are some that caught my eye.

- Ends a friendship

Now this is what America is fighting about. But not what is causing the fighting.


<!-- stupid me. frontline pain hs. it's funny, before with rd work, i was like a german trying to understand how to build a bridge, as i learned i watched undiscovered talent and dreamed of helping them realize their souls, and returned to share rd bride building, but got a torrent of resistance, self-image, daddy issues (to anyone who did not see the river so to speak), now i sit here listening to medical stuff as background, just wanting to heal the hs of feeling and occasionally messing up, frontline related stuff. idk funny. -->


## Hunt and Gather then Grow and Look Around

Hunter-gatherers represented the primary mode of human survival for most of our species' existence. These societies were characterized by their intimate knowledge of local environments, sophisticated survival skills, and complex social relationships. They moved frequently to follow food sources, developed intricate tools and hunting techniques, and maintained a deep, symbiotic relationship with their natural surroundings.

Notable examples include indigenous groups like the San people of Southern Africa, Aboriginal Australians, and various Native American tribes who maintained hunter-gatherer lifestyles well into recent centuries. While most modern societies have transitioned to agricultural and industrial modes of living, some hunter-gatherer groups still exist today, preserving ancient human cultural practices.

The agricultural revolution fundamentally reshaped human societies. Settled farming allowed for food surplus, which led to population growth, specialized labor, and the emergence of more complex social organizations. People transitioned from small, egalitarian groups to larger communities with distinct social classes.

This shift created unprecedented changes: increased food security enabled population expansion, but also introduced new challenges like social inequality, disease transmission, and more rigid social structures. The ability to produce and store food transformed human relationships with land, labor, and each other, ultimately laying the groundwork for civilization as we know it today.

The transition fundamentally altered human perception from interconnected ecosystem participants to controllers of their environment. Hunter-gatherers saw themselves as part of nature; agricultural societies began to view nature as something to be dominated and transformed.


**Key Psychological Changes**

- From collective survival to individual accumulation
- Shift from immediate consumption to long-term resource planning
- Increased sense of territorial ownership
- More structured social roles and hierarchies
- Greater emphasis on future planning and resource storage

This transformation represented a profound psychological evolution, fundamentally changing how humans perceived their relationship with the natural world and each other.
