# Does Everybody Know What Time It Is? Tool Time!

### Introduction

A few weeks ago I was getting ready for some home exercise. This being a lifelong habit, I find background noise helps focus, so I tried the 1990s sitcom Home Improvement. I knew about it as a kid but only watched a few episodes. The show was familiar enough to be easy to follow yet I was detached enough that it wouldn't be distracting.

After a few weeks, something caught my eye.

But first let's recap. In prior posts we discussed the idea that "biologists for humans" is a mindset whereby humans are better understood by analyzing the technology we depend on as an ecosystem unto itself, one that we co-evolve with and is subject to the rules of evolution just like biology is.

When we track technological evolution we learn much about ourselves, especially our misleading habit of thinking our stories and ideologies determine our fate and not the ever changing list of tools we use to shelter, feed, and do other required things. 

As it turns out, Home Improvement is an easy way to see that tools are subject to evolution with a lifecycle independent of our own. Evolving technological ecosystems are filled with growth, speciation, co-evolution and other tenets of evolution that are veiled by the stories we tell. Happily, the framework "biologist for humans" will decode how it works to help us live improved lives.

### The Show

Home Improvement was a beloved American sitcom during the 1990s. Starring Tim Allen as Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor, the show centered around a local home improvement television show host and his family, blending comedy with relatable family dynamics. 

Tim hosted the fictional "Tool Time" program, alongside his good-natured co-host Al Borland. The pair taught basic home repairs while highlighting their sponsor's Binford Tools products. Al was a quiet and competent sidekick while Tim loved to try novel techniques that rarely work but was entertaining to watch.

At home, Tim was married to Jill Taylor, a patient, intelligent, and flawed wife, who often served as the voice of reason to Tim's wild antics. Their three sons-Brad, Randy, and Mark-showcased the challenges and joys of raising energetic, rapscallion boys with different personalities and abilities.

The Taylors' next-door neighbor Wilson was a source of wisdom, often giving advice and philosophical insights that helped resolve the episode's conflicts between Tim, Jill, their sons, friends, and co-workers. The show became known for its running gags, including Tim's catchphrase "More power!" and his ability to accidentally injure himself or those around him while on his show or working on home improvement projects.

The name Home Improvement was a metaphor that both home and family are ever a work in progress but always worth putting in the extra effort to keep them going.

That's why the show was more than just a comedy; it was a snapshot of 1990s American family life that resonated with tens of millions of people. It was always in the "Top Ten" in the ratings during its 1991 to 1999 run. And its over 200 episodes are still popular in broadcasting syndication and streaming sites. 

And, watching the show I couldn't help but notice the seeds of the discord and confusion America suffers today with the growing divide between Conservatives and Progressives, and what America could be with more technological self-awareness via "biologist for humans".

### Unspoken Future

Home Improvement did not exist in a hypothetical universe. It was a regular suburb in 1990s America. The Taylors lived outside of Detroit, Michigan, but could very well have been in Indiana, Washington, or California.

Filled with suburban houses, hot rods, consumer goods, high-school drama, first jobs and bowling, layoffs, the life and times of the Taylors was about an average life for everyone in America. 

Let's see what was going on behind the scenes so to speak, in the technological trends of an evolving ecosystem. This evolution enriched the Taylors while they never knew, or cared to acknowledge, its limited shelf-life.

This chart shows the development of new telecommunication technologies. Each line is a new technology that came to market, its speed at moving data, and the estimated time it would take to send/receive one minute of Standard Definition (480p) video.

| Year      | Medium       | Typical Max Speed (Mbps) | 1 Min Video |
| --------- | ------------ | ------------------------ | ----------- |
| 1940s     | AM Radio     | 0.128 (128 kbps)         | ≈4.7 hours  |
| 1950s-70s | TV Broadcast | 3-4 (analog equivalent)  | ≈8-12 min   |
| 1980s     | Cable TV     | 5 (analog est.)          | ≈7 min      |
| 1990s     | Internet     | 0.056 (56k modem)        | ≈10.7 hours |
| 1990s     | Cable Modem  | 27-38                    | ≈57-80 sec  |
| 2000s     | Broadband    | 100+                     | ≈21 sec     |
| 2010s     | Fiber        | 1000 (1 Gbps)            | ≈2 sec      |
| 2020s     | DOCSIS 3.1+  | 10000 (10 Gbps)          | ≈0.2 sec    |

* Approximations of “One minute of video” uses a common SD (480p) rate for equivalence.

From the 1940s to today saw a huge increase in telecommunication. There were similar huge gains in the speed and storage capacity of physical video media. Going from the magnetic tape technology of VHS to the optical and digital technology of DVD and Blu-Ray saw a big increase in storage capacity and audio visual quality.

Physical Media Storage Capacity
| Decade | Medium  | Typical Capacity        | SD Hrs | HD Hrs      |
| ------ | ------- | ----------------------- | ------ | ------------|
| 1980s  | VHS     | 1.4 GB (per tape at SP) | ~2     | N/A         |
| 1990s  | DVD     | 4.7 GB (single-layer)   | ~2     | ~0.5 (480p) |
| 2000s  | Blu-ray | 25 GB (single-layer)    | ~13    | ~2   (1080p)|
| 2010s+ | Blu-ray | 50 GB (dual-layer)      | ~26    | ~4.5 (1080p)|

* SD and HD video hours are approximations.

All of these increases in telecommunications and storage capacity meant much change in houses throughout America. Not only could companies record, store, and communicate more information to customers. But homes gradually got ever more powerful devices themselves. These big evolutionary jumps in ability are worthy of Tim Taylor's famous tagline "More Power!".

Perhaps we should say "Moore Power!" as it was doubling of transistor density in microchips (known as Moore's Law), that fueled most of these startling gains from the 1970s onwards.

What all these technological improvements mean is that as the years went by, Americans got more information broadcasted, beamed, or streamed their way. Thus, the channel options available to users grew at an incredible rate.

| Era/Decade  | Medium               | Typical Channels Accessible to Creators      |
| ----------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------|
| 1940s       | AM/FM Radio          | 40–100 (local and regional stations)         |
| 1940s–1960s | Broadcast TV         | 3–6 (usually major networks in large cities) |
| 1970s       | Broadcast TV         | 5–15 (expansion and local stations)          |
| 1980s       | Cable TV             | 30–60+ (large metro areas sometimes had 80)  |
| 1990s       | Cable TV             | 60–100+ (premium and niche channels grow)    |
| 1990s       | Satellite TV         | 150–200 (direct broadcast systems emerge)    |
| 2000s       | Digital Cable/Sat    | 200–500+                                     |
| 2010s–2020s | Internet Streaming   | Unlimited (YouTube: millions; Twitch, etc.)  |

While the number of channels increased from 1940s to 1990s, the technology was still quite limited. Customers of broadcast, cable, or satellite technologies received what was sent with only a relatively minor increase in options to choose their content and no ability to upload their own (unless they impressed the many layers of people controlling broadcasting and sponsors and got their own show on television, a task Tim Taylor had to do).

But come the 2010s, the internet was so fast people could watch anything they wanted, and upload anything they wanted. While broadcast/cable/satellite is a one-way radio, the internet is a two-way radio that lets everyone communicate when and how they want.

The results were predictable.

Here are the Google searches for Blockbuster, the largest video rental store, and Netflix the popular streaming service, between Jan 1st 2004 to Jan 1st 2010. For any younger generation, Blockbuster was a physical store that people paid about six dollars to rent a VHS or DVD for a few days. If the customer was late in returning the rental, there was a late charge, and with only so many physical media, what was in stock and available to rent was always uncertain.

Blockbuster used the internet to tell when their store hours and also what was in stock. But did not rent videos for online streaming. Once online streaming was technically possible and offered to the public, people flocked away from DVD purchases and rentals, as they did to other new technologies.

Now, what does all this technological progress have to do with Home Improvement? It depends how important you think tools are to our lives and on how much awareness you think a person should have about what new technology is coming.

Do you think Jill and Tim Taylor should be aware of these telecommunication trends?

## America

A recurring lesson the Taylor family learned was that they had a pretty good life. The parents were around 35 years old with three healthy kids, one working parent, a suburban home with two cars, hot rods, and everyone did loads of shopping. That life would be pretty satisfactory to a lot of people.

Yet, the vast majority of the family income is based on a snapshot in time.

In the early 1990s cable technology was beaming hundreds of channels to an audience used to having only several broadcast channels. "Cable TV" was new and filled with so many novel news, shows, movies, and how-to options people paid a premium to sit in their couches and watch it. For example, when the Cable News Network, CNN, sent live images of the 1991 American bombing of Iraq, it was revolutionary and transfixed Americans.

So, the Taylor suburban home, the large yard, the cars, the stay-at-home mom, the rapscallion kids, all that was paid by Tim's job as a regional cable TV host. Yet, it was a fleeting paycheck. In retrospect cable shows had a decade of premium attention with a marked loss of audience as American homes got broadband internet access.

A modern version of Tool Time on YouTube would very likely not afford to keep the Taylors, never mind the dozens of producers, co-hosts, camera crew, editors, marketing, and others, employed.

And who couldn't see this coming?

Anyone who didn't have a mindset that technological evolution is a wave we ride with a lifecycle independent of ours.

The Taylors get themselves a satellite dish, buy new laptops, get cell phones. Tim routinely reviews new and more powerful tools from his sponsor. Yet the fact the family's fortunes are tied to this technological development is not known.

I'll leave it to the reader to note the current viewing habits of Americans on broadcast TV and cable subscriptions, but increasingly on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and Twitch. So do you think the Taylors should have been aware of what lies ahead? A quick YouTube search showcases thousands of on-demand videos of everything Tool Time showed. Today millions of creators are scrambling to find sponsors and attract clicks. 

There are definitely people still watching broadcast and cable television. But the trend is a clear movement to streaming. ABC, CBS, NBC, even PBS whose "This Old House" is what Tool Time is based on, are all cutting back.

Yet, this time bomb is never talked about.

## Ignorance Is Not Bliss

The Taylors' ignorance, and that of the entire Tool Time crew, is fair. As a society, we know technological change is coming, but do not understand how, when, or why.

The 1990s Taylor family is what modern America still wants to live. Consumer spending, single family homes, going to college, several family cars, all of these are the trends we've discussed in early blog posts. Each is driving Americans, especially younger Americans, into massive debt.

Because each, like regional cable TV shows, is underpinned by an era of technological development. One that lives according to its own timetables, and which we are clinging to past its life expectancy.

Instead of evolving new tools and ways of life, we interpret these pains with our stories.

The important policy decisions rooted in Conservative or Progressive economic philosophies are treated to be the source of our problems. Regardless of government policy, the Taylors' future was set in stone. Ironically, it's the very good cross-party compromises between Progressive and Conservatives from the 1960s to 1990s that supercharged Internet Age technology. Just think, the Soviet Union also invented an early internet, but its political leadership never funded it.

Every time a homeowner finds a YouTube video on how to install a new toilet, or seal leaking windows, our ideologues and political parties should be shaking hands at their shared amazing achievement. We don't (yet) because like the Taylors, we simply do not know how a "biologist for humans" could research, ask, and help people understand the technological evolution under our feet is more important than our personal beliefs.

And we could find those answers.

The Taylors, like many of us today who think technologies like AI or space-based internet won't transform our paychecks, treated cable TV like a sort of fruit tree. Whilst it provided food and shelter they protected it and enjoyed their good fortune.

There was once a time we wandered the biological ecosystem, took what we found and didn't really understand how to master the environment's rhymes or reasons. Until we learned the plants we wanted to cultivate.

## We Hunted and Gathered, then Planted and Waited

You might have heard about hunter-gatherers. If you've ever gotten lost in a forest you may have experienced a hint of our ancestors' lifestyle. 

Hunting-gathering represented the primary survival mode for most of our species' existence. They followed food sources, developed some tools and hunting techniques, and maintained a deep, symbiotic relationship with their natural surroundings. They also came up with stories to explain the stars, seasons, and where to find the best hunting grounds.

They were apart and at peace with nature, but didn't really master it until we planted it for ourselves.

There's debate about why humans even did so. It takes many generations of planting to get more food from early agriculture than simply getting it from nature. Regardless of why, once agriculture took hold, it started cities, roads, and other hallmarks of civilization.

This analogy isn't exact, but we have so little understanding and appreciation of the technological ecosystem, we are not unlike hunter-gatherers of the biological world. Like the Taylors, we happen across technology and do not know for how long it will provide us a paycheck.

And when it doesn't we interpret our misfortune using our stories and not the realities of evolution.

A biologist for humans will help do for our future, what the agriculture transition did for us before. 

Because the same principles apply. Speciation, natural and artificial selection, co-evolution and many more forces are at play. To learn more about how to plant and cultivate the new technological ecosystems to everyone's benefit, please read Techvolution.
