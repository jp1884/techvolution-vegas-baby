# The More Cool Tech We Invent, The More We Hate #1

## The Digital Revolution and our hateful politics

Could the laptops, smartphones, AI, and other amazing tech in our hands be slowly turning us against each other? 

After all, every device, notification, and algorithm is subtly reshaping our world, changing how teachers, accountants, welders—all of us—interact. Could it be that new technology created our collapsing politics?

Well, the trends do have a similar story.

## The Multiplying Transistor

It starts in 1947 with the invention of a tiny marvel: the transistor, a device used to amplify or switch electrical signals and power.

When placed inside a microchip, the transistor became the fundamental building block of electronics and microchips. Whether it's a pocket calculator or a missile, the more transistors a device has, the more powerful it becomes.

In 1965 Dr. Gordon Moore saw an interesting trend: the number of transistors on microchips would double approximately every two years and be cheaper to manufacture. This prediction, which would become known as Moore's Law, proved right on the money.

In 1971, a computer processor (basically a computer's brain) contained 2,300 transistors. By 1980, that number grew to 50,000, and by 1990, over a million. Today's smartphones pack tens of billions of transistors inside them.

As Moore's Law gave us super powerful devices, a parallel transformation was taking place in American politics, most easily seen in the halls of the United States Congress.

## When Technology Divides

It may surprise many today, but our political life was not always filled with rancor and wrath.

Not too long ago in the 1950s and 1960s, the U.S. Congress had much cross-party cooperation. Political discourse was more fluid, legislators from every state forged relationships, made deals, and actually agreed with each other quite often.

We can quantify this political cooperation.

In a 2015 study, _"The Rise of Partisanship and Super-Cooperators in the U.S. House of Representatives"_, researchers studied the voting records of Congress. They measured which legislators formed ideological relationships with members of the opposite party. They labeled two members "cooperators" if they agreed on votes more often than a same party pairing of representatives.

The numbers showcase the era's relative bipartisanship. From 1967 to 1979, Congress had at least 10% cooperators.

Interestingly, this peak of cooperation occurred during one of the most tumultuous periods in American history, marked by the Vietnam War, Civil Rights movement, the Watergate scandal, and political assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King, and Robert F. Kennedy.

But, as the number of transistors on microchips soared through the 1980s and 1990s, the cooperative spirit in Congress eroded. By the 2000s, as personal computers and the internet invaded our homes, political civility started its collapse.

Just look at these graphs. The first shows transistor counts rising exponentially (Moore's Law), while the others compare cross-party pairs (CP) and same party pairs (SP) in the congressional voting record—two opposing trends moving in lockstep.

One might figure a plethora of amazing new tools would be cause for celebration, agreements, and mutually beneficial progress.

Instead, partisanship and non-cooperation "has been increasing at an annual rate of about 5% over the last 60 years." The trend is clear as day in America (but also in much of the Western world), the more transistors we put on our microchips the more our politics breaks down.

Worse to think about, what does our future hold since transistor counts keep rising.

Of course, correlation is not causation. What if these trends are not related? Perhaps more digital technology and more hateful politics is just a coincidence.

We'll delve deeper into the causation question in the next few posts. For now, look at this visualization of Congressional voting patterns and wonder if there's hidden forces at work to explain our growing divide.

# The More Cool Tech We Invent, The More We Hate #2

## Post Two: More Trends

In a prior post we asked if the recent exponential increase in transistors, called Moore's Law, caused our politics to turn hateful.

Both trends were certainly similar.

When consumer electronics got started in the 1970s US Congress had a culture of bipartisanship unthinkable today. As rising transistor counts birthed ever more powerful electronics political discord rose. 

But was there causation between rising transistor count and political breakdown?

Other factors can be said to have contributed, such as media echo chambers, demagogues inflaming voters, political campaigns being funded by rich benefactors. Perhaps these culprits are to blame for political polarization and the rise of transistors is just a happenstance.

The problem is these factors all existed before Gordon Moore wrote his famous law.

## Historical Context

News and entertainment media are not new. The "circulation wars of the early 20th century mirrored today's media echo chambers. Media magnates such as Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolf Heart used giant headlines and shock photos, so called "yellow journalism", to manipulate narratives much like modern media influencers. While the insatiable drive for newspaper buys is comparable to today's the lust for likes.

Influential talking heads were around too.

During the Great Depression, socialists like Earl Browder and radio personality Father Charles Coughlin captivated massive audiences. Browder held large rallies while Coughlin, mixing Catholic faith with controversial politics, commanded tens of millions of listeners—similar to today's polarizing cable news personalities.

The rich also funded the politics in the past as well. 

American tycoons wielded significant political influence through economic power and strategic philanthropy. Industrial leaders like Rockefeller, Carnegie, and Morgan shaped national policy by funding campaigns, lobbying legislators, and pulling strings of power with their economic networks. Their philanthropic foundations and political connections allowed them to impact national decisions, creating a unique relationship between corporate interests and government.

The point is many of the commonly cited causes to our partisanship have existed before. Manipulative media, influential talking heads, rich funded political campaigns are not new anymore than gerrymandering, racial tensions or economic inequality.

Perhaps ever more powerful electronics supercharged existing problems and pushed our system to the breaking point. For example, what if cable news and social media are simply more present and targeted and therefore more influential than radio and newspapers.

That is certainly possible. Digital technology makes media echo chambers easier to create and maintain. However, the rise of communism and fascism in the 1920s-30s demonstrates that powerful persuasion existed long before algorithms—through mass rallies and propaganda that could radicalize entire societies without any digital targeting.

These reasons for today's growing polarization seem incomplete. What if political breakdown is merely a symptom of a larger transformation? Let's test this hypothesis by examining other domains to see if a profound shift is truly underway.

We'll look at the environment. Surely the world's plants and creatures are isolated from the problems of society. How's Mother Nature been doing lately.

Things aren't so good.

## Beyond Politics: Environment and Economics

Unfortunately, the environment is not isolated from human society. Biologists today say the Sixth Mass Extinction is underway, with species extinction rates comparable to previous mass extinction events like the one that wiped out the dinosaurs. Then there's climate change, with most scientists documenting accelerating warming trends, with unknown consequences for the planet because of our refusal to stop overusing fossil fuels.

<!-- insert graph of global temperatures -->
<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change#/media/File:Global_Temperature_And_Forces_With_Fahrenheit.svg -->

This stands in stark contrast to 1970, when just eight years after the book "Silent Spring" awakened America to its suffering environment a Republican president created the Environment Protection Agency. Within a decade of becoming aware of the serious problem, American politics was on its way to cleaning up the many oil spills and smoke stacks harming the country (although it must be said, some solutions were exporting the problem to other countries).

Rising transistor counts correlate with environmental collapse by enabling massive increases in consumption and resource extraction. Transistors powered new powers in navigation, robotics, and global supply chains that reduced production costs while making environmental damage less visible to consumers.

Let's look at another area. How is the government debt going? 

Governments routinely borrow money to fund operations, from public school salaries to military bases. The ratio of debt to economic size is known as the debt-to-GDP ratio.

The history of America's debt ratio tells a familiar story. During the Great Depression, despite widespread hunger and unemployment, the debt ratio for local, state, and federal governments was about 60%. During World War II, when America turned a 200,000 person military into a 12 million with tens of thousands of tanks, planes, and boats, government debt rose to 120%.

However, after the war ended, this debt ratio became scary. Debt ratios matter because they determine how much financial firepower governments have for the next war, recession, or national emergency—which is why post-WWII leaders prioritized bringing the ratio down.

In response, much like when Americans founded the EPA to deal with their environment problems, the US Congress cooperated, compromised, and made deals to address the debt ratio. With strong economic growth and sound policy decisions by 1960 the ratio was about 70% and by 1980 government debt ratio was down to about 50%.

Since then however, the debt has ballooned to above World War II levels. It's currently about 130% and still rising.

All told, we are as damaging to the environment as a meteor strike while using up more resources than a world war.

## The Bigger Picture

Now we see the rise in transistors coincides with rising political partisanship, ecological and environmental damages, and growing government debt.

There are some positive trends of course. The murder rate has been improving, as have literacy rates and smoking is far less common. Regardless, many things in our society in addition to politics, environment, debt, have gotten worse. Youth home ownership has plummeted, student debt has skyrocketed, and personal health metrics show troubling trends. 

In the last post of this series, we'll see why this is all not coincidence.

These interconnected trends suggest something profound: our technological capabilities are rapidly evolving exponentially, while our personal identities, ideological politics, and economic systems remain unchanged. The transistor didn't just change our devices; it fundamentally challenged our ability to collectively respond to rapid change, and so far we've failed. 

Moore's Law gave us power we don't yet understand in a world we are not evolved to navigate.

## Technology Is Our Blind Spot

Political polarization. Environmental collapse. Exploding debt. In our previous posts, we traced these seemingly unrelated crises to a common timeline: they all emerged or accelerated when transistors began their exponential growth in the 1970s.

But correlation isn't causation. What's the mechanism? How exactly does Moore's Law—a trend about manufacturing more powerful computer chips—cause political breakdown or species extinction?

The answer requires us to see ourselves the way biologists see other species: as organisms whose survival depends on adapting to our environment. And our environment has been transforming at a pace unprecedented in human history.

Of course non-digital technology already changed our planet. Before Moore's Law, ships sailed the world, rigs pumped oil, projectors displayed movies, newspapers filled with news, telephones carried communication.

There was much technology before the 1970s.

But as transistor counts doubled roughly every two years, nearly everything got supercharged. We got computers to design bigger buildings, robots to manufacture more machines, radar to dig deeper mines, hard drives to store libraries of knowledge in ebooks, internet to link everything together, and so much more.

Here's an example of just how much powerful electronics got with Moore's Law.

These images show the evolution of computer game graphics. This incredible growth in processing power happened to all our tools, from medical imaging devices to Artificial Intelligence.

## Your Life

Moore's Law is not a law of physics like gravity. Rather, it's an observation that the cost of making transistors decreases over time so that they can be doubled about every two years.

The law is somewhat self-fulfilling. Semiconductor designers and fabricators hold themselves up to the expectations of Dr. Gordon Moore's famous law, and thus keep finding ways to make it come true. Despite increasing technical hurdles and frequent industry doubts, their continued success makes product road maps so reliable that customers can expect the next iPhone or Playstation, on a regular schedule like Apple's annual product releases.

While customers eagerly await the next must have technology, it was this rapid technological evolution that stressed our politics, environment, and economics.

Here's an example of how it stressed our daily lives. I'm sure some of you will painfully understand if you've ever dealt with health insurance at any length.

The entire US healthcare system has exploded in size and complexity since—you guessed it—Moore's Law started to gain momentum.

Here's a graph that shows the growth in healthcare accountants, insurance adjusters, managers, anyone who helps administer the healthcare system, versus the increase in doctors.

<!-- https://repository.arizona.edu/bitstream/handle/10150/631752/087-18.pdf?sequence=1 -->

As a former claims adjuster I can say most everyone complains about insurance. But few understand why it's often so frustrating and expensive. Today's system has an endless array of companies, departments, meetings, conference calls, policies, regulations, laws, contact numbers, and procedures, with very few standards to ease their interactions.

As Moore's Law created better and cheaper computers, printers, email, internet, and now AI, it became easier for us to create rules, regulations, paperwork etc. and the jobs that administer it all.

Some of these rules and administers are needed. Just not nearly this many. Like animals that overgraze their territory , we're using our new technological power to accelerate existing business practices and behaviors, even when those behaviors destroy the system we depend on.

But like in politics, environment, and debt, Moore’s Law gave society tools we were unprepared to use wisely. The result was not a reduction in administrative labor and paperwork as one would think computers enable, but a digitally enhanced expansion of it—proof that technological potential is only as good as the system that wields it.

Hopefully the real cause to our political, economic, and environmental problems is starting to take root in your head.

## Biologists for Humans

If we had started this series not by asking if Moore's Law caused our political partisanship, but instead asked if Moore's Law sped up the Sixth Mass Extinction, we'd find the answer easier to digest.

For biologists, the connection between technological acceleration and species extinction is clear. As environments transform faster than species can possibly adapt, animals find themselves increasingly unable to locate critical resources, leading to hunger, fights over resources, and population collapse.

We see a fish out of water and know there's a problem. Yet, we do not understand our pains with such clarity.

We could, because we are not much different than the walrus struggling to find polar ice or the Florida alligator competing against waves of Burmese pythons.

In short, we have no "biologists" who understand and explain our situation. If we did, we would not see Moore's Law as the rise of electronics, but the creation of a new environment. And it is living in this new environment that causes the problems we see starting and getting worse since the 1970s.

This blog series has not been about if transistors change nature. It's an introduction to look in the mirror and gain some self-awareness to see how ourselves as biologists see creatures; beings whose work habits, social structures, ways of living are constantly tested by evolution.

To understand how rapidly our environment is changing, consider this:

The lifespan of a modern American is about 70 years. The lifespan of modern electronic technology is so much shorter. That means while many elders are confused by iPhones, almost all youths don't know how to use telephones or understand what a DVD rental store late fee is.

Who can blame either group. The technologies that once dominated our world just 20 years ago are effectively extinct.

And yet, it is not uncommon for the youth to be educated, managed, and lead, by people who are not forced to evolve to today's technology, never mind will never have to reconcile earning a living and raising a family when trillions of transistors live in everyone's pockets, something expected around 2035.

Our biology did not evolve to rethink our identities, politic, and economics so many times within a single human lifetime.

Because the fact that we need to update ourselves, workplaces, and society, i.e. evolve, as technology does, eludes us. We follow an old map when the geography has changed.

The mismatch shows up everywhere. People who manage global supply chains often think about retirement or getting a new job rather than recognizing they're stewarding complex technological ecosystems. Teachers tell students not to use AI, while employers expect workers to master this technology to remain employable. There are endless other examples happening every day because we are not self-aware just how much Moore's Law has changed our environment. 

## Techvolution

To understand ourselves in the era of Moore's Law, we need a new paradigm. One that puts technology at the forefront of our identities, politics, and economics.

Until we change our mindsets, we'll go on using increasingly powerful technology with outdated biological instincts. 

But recognizing this mismatch also points toward a solution. 

What if we applied evolutionary principles to understand how civilizations adapt to new technological environments? The same forces that have guided life for billions of years might show us how to thrive in our digital age instead of being torn apart by it. 

I've been exploring this evolutionary framework for our technological civilization, and the early findings are promising. If you're curious about this approach to our modern struggles, you can read more at books.techvolution.org. 

This blog will continue examining how we might consciously evolve beyond our current political and social breakdown. Because if transistors helped create these problems, understanding technological evolution might help us solve them.

<!-- And, as home computers became mobile laptops in the 2000s and smartphones in the 2010s, society got even more computerized, and following the trend, researchers termed "hyper-partisanship" to describe our politics. Now fewer than 1.5% of Congressional cross-party pairs demonstrated cooperative voting patterns.

"Moreover, public opinion of Congress has declined simultaneously from 60% favorable rating in the 1960s to a 10% favorable rating today [30] also correlating with more bifurcation in Congress over this time period. We discuss these points further below." -->
