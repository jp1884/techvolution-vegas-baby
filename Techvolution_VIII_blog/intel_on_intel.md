## Dear Intel Team (and anyone else making chips) 

## I'm thankful

I want to thank the unsung people at Intel. To all the support staff, technicians, programmers, engineers, chemists, physicists: your work is way too unappreciated.

Just in the past few weeks your media coverage has been "COLLAPSE: Intel is Falling Apart", "The End Times of Intel", "Intel Will Never Recover". 

The dramatic proclamations against you come from people who don't deal with countless suppliers, wait on building permits, interpret environmental rules, follow union laws,...

All while working on a never ending Manhattan Project. Your microchip processors went from:

- 4,500 transistors in the early 1970s in the 8080 chip
- 3.2 million transistors in the early 1990s Pentium chip.
- Tens of billions of transistors in the forthcoming Panther Lake processor.

<!-- IMAGE OF INTEL's MICROPROCESSOR HISTORY -->

You started and sustained Moore's Law--the observation that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles about every two years--for decades. Few other companies have given their economy such an incredible rate of improvement.

All this must be incredibly hard.

The first commercial transistors were made in 1960s and  were the size buttons. Nobody, not even physicists and chemists, understood why some would work and some didn't. As transistors counts have increased and sizes decreased, understanding has improved but the mystery is still quite deep.

The complexity is amazing.

There are hundreds of very specialized tools required to make a modern "leading edge" chip. Operating these tools require skill sets so specialized their rarity and preciousness is comparable to an endangered species. 

Lithography machines are like advanced printers for computer chips. They use precise light or radiation to transfer intricate circuit designs onto silicon wafers coated with light-sensitive material. As Moore's Law progressed, these machines required increasingly sophisticated optical systems, smaller wavelengths, and more complex mask designs to create ever-smaller transistor features.

The semiconductor industry has explored at least 13 distinct lithography technologies, including proximity, projection, and electron beam (E-beam) lithography. The current state-of-the-art is High Numerical Aperture Extreme Ultraviolet lithography, with machines costing over $350 million each.

These systems can create features with critical dimensions below 8nm—to put this in perspective the number in 1990 was about 230nm, and a DNA molecule is approximately 2.5nm wide.

This progress is not certain. It's filled with twists and turns, false starts, and unrealized potential. The tools of semiconductor manufacturing on a diagram look like a tree of life and most branches end up being dead ends of extinction.

In this fog of development, your ability to pack transistors onto chips fell a bit behind. As tech reporters are apt to say, the other guys make faster and more powerful microchips, perhaps being 6-12 months ahead (although the gap should close impending 18/14A process nodes I'm told).

We may need the fastest graphics or processor microchips as soon as absolutely possible. But for sure we need chips. You do that for us right here at home, safe and secure, so the negative attention you're getting over the past several years is BS.

## Still In the Race

All was going well for decades. Perhaps too well. You made the best chips and people were effectively forced to buy from you. And you sometimes threw your weight around a little too much by stomping competition or pressuring suppliers. You even felt confident enough to reject Steve Jobs when he asked you to make the microchips for Apple's new device, the iPhone.

It wasn't until around 2015 when trouble emerged.

It's my understanding that when the extreme ultraviolet lithography lithography tool wasn't ready for you to keep making transistors smaller, you tried cobalt interconnects and extensive multi-patterning instead (and I'm sure countless other techniques too complex for my enthusiast brain).

It didn't work out. You got stuck in the mystery of semi-conductor manufacturing and tried to figure out why and went from being years ahead to years behind in the race to keep adding transistors to microchips.

That meant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp (TSMC), who makes chips for Apple, nVidia, AMD, and most every tech company, had the fastest process along with the scale of making most of the world's chips.

When you tried to get other customers into your own foundry business, few had (technical) reasons to join up.

The result was your products and manufacturing were stuck, and you bled money trying to keep pace with the entire industry's research, development, and high-volume production.

So what. Ferrari hasn't won a F1 title in generations. The Chicago Cubs took over a century to win a championship. NASA couldn't come up with reuseable rockets.

Yet we still hope the best for these organizations, and give their people money, awards, and accolades because we understand how hard it is to achieve their goals.

For some reason, your naysayers won't do that for you. They should.

It's not that you are perfect. I'm sure those on the inside know more than anyone else the hubris, missteps, and mistakes that saw a titan become a napping rabbit.

I mean you were founded by PhDs and probably shouldn't have anyone in control who does not see the Periodic Table as a recipe book (it was a business minded CEO who rejected making iPhone's chips). I hear there are too many middle managers there (like in much of the American economy). Also, share buybacks seem to be a bad idea in an industry as unpredictable and capital intensive as yours.

But you can still put billions of transistors on a microchip. And that's precious.

So I just wanted to say thanks. In the next blog post, we'll uncover why more people should too.

Note, I wrote this in early Sept. since then several companies are investing and showing interest in Intel's foundry.

## Why Intel Matters and Doesn't Matter

## Brands Are Human Names

>You can know the name of a bird in all the languages of the world, but when you're finished, you'll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird... So let's look at the bird and see what it's doing—that's what counts. I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.

_Richard P. Feynman, "What Do You Care What Other People Think?": Further Adventures of a Curious Character_

I'm not here to promote a billion dollar corporation such as Intel, or the other American based manufacturers such as Texas Instruments or Wolfspeed.

Feynman taught us that knowing a name means nothing—understanding behavior is everything. The same is true for technology. We know 'iPhone' or 'Intel', but do we truly comprehend the technological ecosystem reshaping human civilization?

You can know the name of the next iPhone in all the languages of the world, but when you're finished, you'll know absolutely nothing about the technology that's reshaping civilization. 

Brand names are linguistic placeholders that mask profound technological transformations. Knowing 'Apple' or 'Google' tells us nothing about the complex ecosystem these technologies create and sustain trying to earn there place on Earth.

Thus, knowing brand names is the equivalent of knowing a bird is called a "sparrow" without understanding how it migrates, feeds, or contributes to its ecosystem enough to stay alive.

Just as a biologist would study a species by observing its behaviors, relationships, and environmental impacts, we should learn to see technology not as branded objects, but as a interconnected ecosystem.

Thereafter we'll start becoming the "biologist" for humans. 

Technology is not a collection of products, but a living ecosystem. Like biological species, each digital tool must continuously adapt, harvest resources, and evolve to survive. Just as a biologist studies an organism's behaviors and environmental interactions, we can truly understand technology as a dynamic, interconnected system constantly reshaping human experience.

## Why Americans Should Cherish Intel, or Whichever Name Takes Its Place

Intel researches, designs, and develops computer chips. It's likely that its microchips processed these words in some way getting to your screen.

But its not the company of Intel that I was defending, but the people who work together inside a organization named Intel.

Its huge difference, one seemingly simple, but one that people who mocked "Intel" for years never appeared to care about. The work done at Intel is as pivotal to our countries future as anything you see being debated over politics and culture wars stuff.

Nevermind the supply chain and geo-political concerns. Which are big enough and relatively well known.

More important is what Steve Jobs said, "The best way to predict the future is to invent it". There is no other way to the future than to make it. You can't buy it, or even design it, because that assumes it'll just show up based on your desires or thoughts.

Like every living species, technological products must transform raw materials—sunlight, soil, water—into resources that sustain our technological ecosystem.

We actually have to turn raw materials into products. Only going through that process reveals what is possible with the resources available.

That's why the first computers were imagined from the textile looms of England (the world's most advanced), or why Henry Ford's team imagined car mass manufacturing after looking at a butchery in Chicago (again among the world's most advanced). Even Jobs had to see the graphical user interface (GUI) at Xerox PARC in order to invent the Macintosh.

American manufacturers such as Texas Instruments, Wolfspeed, and Global Foundriesare also doing great work, but only Intel develops the most advanced, "leading edge", semiconductor manufacturing.

But that is a fading skillset and reporters don't realize the Internet Age might pass us by if we stop birthing its products.

So, naysayers should use their skills and find the root problems impeding advanced semiconductor manufacturing in America such as permitting delays, extensive environmental assessments, and making it hard for all semiconductor manufacturers like  to make the chips we need.

Asianometry made a good start with "Intel Should Second Source nVidia."

As for investors, Arthur Rock turned a few bucks and a few young PhD's into Fairchild Semiconductor and the Fairchildren. Intel is the last Fairchild manufacturer, and it's still alive, but if it's 14A node and SDK are not worth investing in, fine.

Then learn from their mistakes and found another company to develop chips here. Japan, in part, is using IBM's know how to make Rapidus and apparently it's going alright.

I must mention the tremendous innovation happening at fabless companies, hyperscalers, and the rest of industry. Of course you do amazing work (I was an AMD and nVidia "fanboy" gamer once), but at the end of the day we need manufacturing here. With all due respect, you should share in the increasing risks of high volume manufacturing development.

That's why the B-2 stealth bomber was not made by the company that invented stealth technology with the F-117 stealh fighter. The US military realized it must share the workload amongst its suppliers because as F1, DARPA, and evolution will attest, a healthy ecosystem fosters innovation more than any one player can ever achieve. A thought so wise it defeated the Soviet Union without firing a shot.

This letter is getting too long I know. I just wanted to say all the naysayers are getting carried away. The huge negativity towards a local company manufacturing advanced microchips in the Internet Age says more about what we measure (clickbait headlines, prestige benchmarks, short-term growth numbers) than what our kids need to prosper.

So, we should all appreciate the people at Intel. They invented the microprocessor, USB, PCIe, and countless other stuff our economy needs. These workers face endless hours turning raw materials into our digital lifeblood and therefore deserve our respect and thanks.

If this sounds like wishful thinking, think of this, unless we change our aversion to mining and manufacturing in America, the USA is going to spend billions birthing the Internet Age, and end up with not a single way of making a chip.

## P.S.

- does it matter? what are we racing against that overcomes geopolitical, supply chain, and proximity? yes i know there is expertise but getting the iPhone 23 a year after the current timeline is a change likely to shut down our economy...

- it would require a book to fully flesh the message out (especially for anyone who believes in "comparative advantage"). We don't think of our technological ecosystem as something needing study, management, and care. But we still need it, so we act out using emotions instead of reason....

- it exposes what may be the fatal flaw of western liberal democracies. you can't win and your ecosystem lose. meaning you're victory must be a local material one, and not because of legal ownership of a far away place...no lion can be a king because of a foriegn jungle.

- you can't cheer for a brand like we do "teams" in a sporting event, because teams are organized and everyone always gets another chance. brands are really infrastructure and everyone should be cheering, and supporting, their bridges, buildings, and manufacturers to succeed. Otherwise, you're just assuming someone else will do your work for you and not take advantage of you.

- USA is going to spend billions on AI and this and that, and end up with not a single way of making a chip.

 - industry folk, you're competing yourself to death. literally, you're exported away. why is waiting and being a little more patient for the next node such a big deal...?

Start by noting the devasation to ecologies/biosystems from human actions, with little regard to long term effects, ala the American buffalo or European lion et al. Then note how tech YouTubers, et al are dismissing intel for being Ferrari of F1...

## Why so serious?

Since its emergence, semiconductor lithography has witnessed no fewer than 11 distinct attempts to introduce new tool technologies (see table). Tlie intnxluction of these tools has enahled many advances in the semiconductor industry. While the forward progress of the industry is beyond question, this progress has been punctuated by numerous false starts and cases of unrealized potential.

## Lithography machines

### Intro

Semiconductor lithography machines are critical tools used in the manufacturing of semiconductor devices, especially microchips. Their main purpose is to transfer intricate circuit patterns onto silicon wafers, which form the foundational structures of integrated circuits used in electronics like smartphones and computers.

The process works by projecting light through a photomask or reticle, which contains the blueprint of the circuit pattern. This pattern is then reduced and precisely focused onto a silicon wafer coated with a photosensitive material called photoresist. The exposure alters the photoresist in specific areas according to the pattern, allowing subsequent steps to etch the actual circuit onto the wafer.

There are several types of lithography machines based on the light source used:

Optical lithography (photolithography) uses ultraviolet (UV) light for pattern projection, widely used for larger feature sizes.

Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography employs much shorter wavelength light (13 nm) to create finer, smaller, and more complex patterns necessary for advanced microchips.

Electron beam lithography, which uses focused electron beams rather than light, offers extremely high precision mainly for research and prototyping but is slower for mass production.

Key components of these machines include the light source (UV, EUV, or electron beam), photomasks/reticles for patterning, and wafer stages to hold and precisely position the silicon wafer during exposure.

These lithography machines enable the production of smaller, faster, and more efficient chips by allowing very fine, high-density transistor layouts. They are fundamental in pushing forward electronic device performance, supporting AI, IoT, and other advanced technologies by fabricating complex semiconductor devices.

In essence, semiconductor lithography equipment is the cornerstone technology that drives the creation of the micro-scale electrical patterns necessary to build integrated circuits powering modern electronics.

### Cost 

Present day litho tools cost ~$50-$80 million. But in a high volume manufacturing
(HVM) environment, such as a chip making factory, they operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, at > 90 % up time, generally for at least 5 years. A state-of-theart 193 nm wavelength litho tool requires only about 20 seconds to 30 seconds to completely expose a 300 mm diameter silicon wafer. This corresponds to a “throughput” of ~120 to ~180 wafers per hour. Thus, during its 5 year lifetime, a tool will expose on the order of 5 million wafers which amortizes the $50-80 million tool cost to only about $10-$16 per full-wafer exposure. A fully patterned 300 mm diameter wafer will yield a few hundred to a few thousand chips depending on the chip size. For a chip requiring 30 exposures to complete it, the tool cost contributes from only a few cents to a few dollars to the cost of each chip.

### Development History

Notable make and models of semiconductor lithography machines during their development, especially from the dominant player ASML, include:

PAS 2000 (1980s): ASML's first system, inherited from Philips and initially sold under the name ASM Lithography. It faced early challenges including oil-based hydraulics unsuitable for cleanrooms and limited commercial success.

PAS 5500 (1990s): Became a widely adopted stepper system by ASML that allowed for smaller chip features with improved alignment and throughput. Many of these older systems remain operational today.

TWINSCAN Series (2001 onward): Introduced dual-stage technology that increased throughput by simultaneously exposing one wafer while aligning the next. This series includes models like:

TWINSCAN AT:1150i (first immersion lithography machine, 2003)

TWINSCAN XT:1700i (first volume immersion production, 2006)

TWINSCAN XT:1900i (industry highest numerical aperture of 1.35, 2007)

TWINSCAN NXT and NXT:1950i (major immersion lithography systems enabling chip feature sizes down to 32 nm)

TWINSCAN NXE Series (EUV lithography, 2010s–present): These machines utilize extreme ultraviolet light (~13.5 nm wavelength) to produce much finer patterns. Notable models include:

NXE:3100 (early commercial EUV)

NXE:3350B

NXE:3600D (best-selling model, extremely complex and costly)

High-NA EUV Systems (Launching 2023-2025): Next-generation EUV lithography machines with higher numerical aperture (0.55 vs. 0.33) for even finer resolution. First shipments went to Intel in 2023 and TSMC in late 2024.

### Estimated Prices

ASML PAS 2000 (1980s): The PAS 2000 was ASML's first system launched in 1984. Early on, the project required about 120 million Dutch guilders (roughly €245 million in today's money) for development and production scale-up. However, the actual sale prices in the early 1980s were far lower per unit, but precise data isn't widely documented.

ASML PAS 5500 (1990s): This machine became wildly successful and helped ASML emerge as a market leader. In the 1990s, lithography tools similar to PAS 5500 were priced around tens of millions of dollars per unit, with a typical estimate for advanced steppers in the $10 million to $30 million range.

ASML TWINSCAN Immersion Systems (2000s): These featured major technological advancements like water immersion to improve feature resolution. Prices for top-end immersion lithography scanners during the 2000s to early 2010s ranged from approximately $30 million to $60 million per system depending on the model and capabilities.

ASML NXE EUV Lithography Systems (2010s–present): EUV machines are among the world's most expensive semiconductor equipment. ASML EUV tools typically cost approximately $150 million to $250 million per system.

ASML Next-Generation High-NA EUV Systems (Launching 2023-2025): These newest lithography machines with higher numerical aperture technology are expected to cost even more, in the range of $300 million or more per unit.
