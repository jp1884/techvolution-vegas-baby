## Dear Intel Team (and anyone else making chips) 

## I'm thankful

I wanted to write this here just for any Intel workers. Thanks for what you do. All the engineers, scientists, programmers, technicians, and support staff, your job is awfully hard and lately its totally unappreciated.

Just in the past few weeks it's been "COLLAPSE: Intel is Falling Apart", "The End Times of Intel", "Intel Will Never Recover". 

The dramatic proclamations against you come from people who don't deal with suppliers, wait on building permits, interpret environmental rules, follow union laws,...

All while working on a never ending Manhattan Project. Your processors went from

- 4,500 transistors in the early 1970s (the 8080)
- 3.2 million transistors in the early 1990s (pentium).
- Tens of billions of transistors in the forthcoming Xeon 6+ Clearwater Forest.

Here is an imaging showing the histor of Moore's Law, the observation that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles about every two years.

<!-- IMAGE -->

Intel has been at the forefront of semiconductor manufacturing for much of the past 50 years. Few other companies have given their economy such an incredible rate of improvement.

All this must be incredibly hard.

Just in semiconductor lithography alone (the machines that "print" microchips) there has been no fewer than 13 distinct attempts to introduce new tools (Proximity, Projection, E-beam, etc.). While there has been great progress, it's filled with twists and turns, false starts, and unrealized potential.

We might need the fastest GPU or CPU as soon as absolutely possible (the other guys mostly edge you out here I'm told). But for sure we need chips. You do that for us right here at home, safe and secure, so the negative attention you're getting over the past several years is BS.

## Well In the Race

In the continual fog of uncertainty trying to keep Moore's Law alive, it's my understanding that when extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) wasn't ready, you tried cobalt interconnects and micro-patterning for your "10nm process node" (and I'm sure countless other techniques too complex for my enthusiast brain).

It didn't work out and you went from being years ahead to years behind in the race to keep adding transistors to microchips.

That meant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp, who makes chips for Apple, nVidia, AMD, and most every tech company, had the process leadership along with the scale of making mobile chips. When you tried to get other customers into a foundry, few had (technical) reasons to join up and share the risks of advanced semiconductor process development.

The result was your products and manufacturing were stuck, and you bled money trying to keep pace with the entire industry.

So what. Ferrari hasn't won a F1 title in generations. The Toronto Maple Leafs hasn't won a championship since 1967. NASA couldn't come up with reuseable rockets.

Yet we still hope the best for these organizations, and give their people awards and accolades because we understand how hard it is to achieve their goals.

For some reason, your naysayers won't do that for you. They should.

It's not that you are perfect. I'm sure those on the inside know more than anyone else the hubris, missteps, and mistakes that saw a titan become a napping rabbit.

I mean you were founded by PhDs and probably shouldn't have anyone in control who does not see the Periodic Table as a recipe book. I hear there are too many middle managers there (like in most of the American economy). Also, share buybacks seem to be a bad idea in an industry as unpredictable and capital intensive as yours.

But you can still put billions of transistors on a chip. And that's precious.

## Why Americans Should Cherish What You Do

The point is no one will notice if a youtuber quits or an investment analyst goes bust. America will notice if we don't get the advanced chips made here.

Nevermind the supply chain and geo-political concerns. More important is what Steve Jobs said, "The best way to predict the future is to invent it". There is no other way to the future than to make it. You can't buy it, or even design it, because that assumes it'll just show up based on your desires or thoughts. We actually have to turn raw materials into products.

Only going through that process reveals what is possible. 

That's why the first computers were imagined from the textile looms of England (the world's most advanced), or why Henry Ford's team imagined car mass manufacturing after looking at a butchery in Chicago (again among the world's most advanced). Even Jobs had to see the GUI at Xerox PARC in order to invent the Macintosh.

Other economies had bankers, reporters, analysts during these revelations, but soon were purchasing the products made by people whose imagination were surrounded by the best technologies.

Texas Instruments, Wolfspeed, Global Foundries are also doing great work, but only Intel is develops the most advanced, "leading edge",  semiconductor manufacturing.

But that is a fading skillset and reporters don't realize the Internet Age might pass us by if we stop birthing its products. So, naysayers should use their skills and find the root problems impeding advanced semiconductor manufacturing in America. Asianometry made a good start with "Intel Should Second Source nVidia."

As for investors, Arthur Rock turned a few bucks and a few young PhD's into Fairchild Semiconductor and the Fairchildren. Intel is the last Fairchild manufacturer, and it's still alive, but if it's 14A node and SDK are not worth investing in, fine.

Then learn from their mistakes and found another company to develop chips here. Japan, in part, is using IBM's know how to make Rapidus and apparently it's going alright.

I must mention the tremendous innovation happening at fabless companies, hyperscalers, and the rest of industry. Of course you do amazing work (I was an AMD and nVidia "fanboy" gamer once), but at the end of the day we need manufacturing here. With all due respect, you should share in the increasing risks of high volume manufacturing development. Even if it's not the fastest absolutely possible, an ecosystem needs support to stay alive.

There's a good reason why the B-2 stealth bomber was not made by the company that invented stealth technology. The US military realized it must share the workload amongst its suppliers because as F1, DARPA, and evolution will attest, a healthy ecosystem fosters innovation more than any one player can ever achieve. A thought so wise it defeated the Soviet Union without firing a shot.

This letter is getting too long I know. I just wanted to say all the naysayers are getting carried away. The huge negativity towards a local company manufacturing advanced microchips in the Internet Age says more about what we measure (clickbait headlines, prestige benchmarks, short-term growth numbers) than what our kids need to prosper.

So, we should all appreciate the people at Intel. They invented the microprocessor, USB, PCIe, and countless other stuff our economy needs. These workers face endless hours turning raw materials into our digital lifeblood and therefore deserve our respect and thanks.

If this sounds like wishful thinking, think of this, unless we change our aversion to mining and manufacturing in America, the USA is going to spend billions birthing the Internet Age, and end up with not a single way of making a chip.

## Why Intel Matters

## Brands Are Human Names

>You can know the name of a bird in all the languages of the world, but when you're finished, you'll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird... So let's look at the bird and see what it's doing—that's what counts. I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.
_Richard P. Feynman, "What Do You Care What Other People Think?": Further Adventures of a Curious Character_

Here's why Intel, Global Foundries, Texax Instruments, Wolfspeed matter so much....

You can know the name of an iPhone in all the languages of the world, but when you're finished, you'll know absolutely nothing about the technology that's reshaping human civilization. We collect brand names like linguistic trophies, believing we understand something simply because we can label it.

But what does "Apple" really tell us? Or "Google"? These are not explanations, they are merely tags—linguistic placeholders that mask the profound technological transformations happening beneath the surface. They are the equivalent of knowing a bird is called a "sparrow" without understanding how it migrates, feeds, or contributes to its ecosystem.

The technology around us is not a collection of products, but a living, evolving system. Each device, each platform, each digital tool is not just a thing, but a dynamic entity with its own evolutionary pressures, adaptive strategies, and complex interactions. Just as a biologist would study a species by observing its behaviors, relationships, and environmental impacts, we must learn to see technology not as branded objects, but as a interconnected ecosystem constantly reshaping human experience.


## POST THREE


## P.S.

- does it matter? what are we racing against that overcomes geopolitical, supply chain, and proximity? yes i know there is expertise but getting the iPhone 23 a year after the current timeline is a change likely to shut down our economy...

- it would require a book to fully flesh the message out (especially for anyone who believes in "comparative advantage"). We don't think of our technological ecosystem as something needing study, management, and care. But we still need it, so we act out using emotions instead of reason....

- it exposes what may be the fatal flaw of western liberal democracies. you can't win and your ecosystem lose. meaning you're victory must be a local material one, and not because of legal ownership of a far away place...no lion can be a king because of a foriegn jungle.

- you can't cheer for a brand like we do "teams" in a sporting event, because teams are organized and everyone always gets another chance. brands are really infrastructure and everyone should be cheering, and supporting, their bridges, buildings, and manufacturers to succeed. Otherwise, you're just assuming someone else will do your work for you and not take advantage of you.

- USA is going to spend billions on AI and this and that, and end up with not a single way of making a chip.

 - industry folk, you're competing yourself to death. literally, you're exported away. why is waiting and being a little more patient for the next node such a big deal...?

## Ignorance of ecosystems

Start by noting the devasation to ecologies/biosystems from human actions, with little regard to long term effects, ala the American buffalo or European lion et al. Then note how tech YouTubers, et al are dismissing intel for being Ferrari of F1...

## Why so serious?

Since its emergence, semiconductor lithography has witnessed no fewer than 11 distinct attempts to introduce new tool technologies (see table). Tlie intnxluction of these tools has enahled many advances in the semiconductor industry. While the forward progress of the industry is beyond question, this progress has been punctuated by numerous false starts and cases of unrealized potential.

## Lithography machines

### Intro

Semiconductor lithography machines are critical tools used in the manufacturing of semiconductor devices, especially microchips. Their main purpose is to transfer intricate circuit patterns onto silicon wafers, which form the foundational structures of integrated circuits used in electronics like smartphones and computers.

The process works by projecting light through a photomask or reticle, which contains the blueprint of the circuit pattern. This pattern is then reduced and precisely focused onto a silicon wafer coated with a photosensitive material called photoresist. The exposure alters the photoresist in specific areas according to the pattern, allowing subsequent steps to etch the actual circuit onto the wafer.

There are several types of lithography machines based on the light source used:

Optical lithography (photolithography) uses ultraviolet (UV) light for pattern projection, widely used for larger feature sizes.

Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography employs much shorter wavelength light (13 nm) to create finer, smaller, and more complex patterns necessary for advanced microchips.

Electron beam lithography, which uses focused electron beams rather than light, offers extremely high precision mainly for research and prototyping but is slower for mass production.

Key components of these machines include the light source (UV, EUV, or electron beam), photomasks/reticles for patterning, and wafer stages to hold and precisely position the silicon wafer during exposure.

These lithography machines enable the production of smaller, faster, and more efficient chips by allowing very fine, high-density transistor layouts. They are fundamental in pushing forward electronic device performance, supporting AI, IoT, and other advanced technologies by fabricating complex semiconductor devices.

In essence, semiconductor lithography equipment is the cornerstone technology that drives the creation of the micro-scale electrical patterns necessary to build integrated circuits powering modern electronics.

### Cost 

Present day litho tools cost ~$50-$80 million. But in a high volume manufacturing
(HVM) environment, such as a chip making factory, they operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, at > 90 % up time, generally for at least 5 years. A state-of-theart 193 nm wavelength litho tool requires only about 20 seconds to 30 seconds to completely expose a 300 mm diameter silicon wafer. This corresponds to a “throughput” of ~120 to ~180 wafers per hour. Thus, during its 5 year lifetime, a tool will expose on the order of 5 million wafers which amortizes the $50-80 million tool cost to only about $10-$16 per full-wafer exposure. A fully patterned 300 mm diameter wafer will yield a few hundred to a few thousand chips depending on the chip size. For a chip requiring 30 exposures to complete it, the tool cost contributes from only a few cents to a few dollars to the cost of each chip.

### Development History

Notable make and models of semiconductor lithography machines during their development, especially from the dominant player ASML, include:

PAS 2000 (1980s): ASML's first system, inherited from Philips and initially sold under the name ASM Lithography. It faced early challenges including oil-based hydraulics unsuitable for cleanrooms and limited commercial success.

PAS 5500 (1990s): Became a widely adopted stepper system by ASML that allowed for smaller chip features with improved alignment and throughput. Many of these older systems remain operational today.

TWINSCAN Series (2001 onward): Introduced dual-stage technology that increased throughput by simultaneously exposing one wafer while aligning the next. This series includes models like:

TWINSCAN AT:1150i (first immersion lithography machine, 2003)

TWINSCAN XT:1700i (first volume immersion production, 2006)

TWINSCAN XT:1900i (industry highest numerical aperture of 1.35, 2007)

TWINSCAN NXT and NXT:1950i (major immersion lithography systems enabling chip feature sizes down to 32 nm)

TWINSCAN NXE Series (EUV lithography, 2010s–present): These machines utilize extreme ultraviolet light (~13.5 nm wavelength) to produce much finer patterns. Notable models include:

NXE:3100 (early commercial EUV)

NXE:3350B

NXE:3600D (best-selling model, extremely complex and costly)

High-NA EUV Systems (Launching 2023-2025): Next-generation EUV lithography machines with higher numerical aperture (0.55 vs. 0.33) for even finer resolution. First shipments went to Intel in 2023 and TSMC in late 2024.

### Estimated Prices

ASML PAS 2000 (1980s): The PAS 2000 was ASML's first system launched in 1984. Early on, the project required about 120 million Dutch guilders (roughly €245 million in today's money) for development and production scale-up. However, the actual sale prices in the early 1980s were far lower per unit, but precise data isn't widely documented.

ASML PAS 5500 (1990s): This machine became wildly successful and helped ASML emerge as a market leader. In the 1990s, lithography tools similar to PAS 5500 were priced around tens of millions of dollars per unit, with a typical estimate for advanced steppers in the $10 million to $30 million range.

ASML TWINSCAN Immersion Systems (2000s): These featured major technological advancements like water immersion to improve feature resolution. Prices for top-end immersion lithography scanners during the 2000s to early 2010s ranged from approximately $30 million to $60 million per system depending on the model and capabilities.

ASML NXE EUV Lithography Systems (2010s–present): EUV machines are among the world's most expensive semiconductor equipment. ASML EUV tools typically cost approximately $150 million to $250 million per system.

ASML Next-Generation High-NA EUV Systems (Launching 2023-2025): These newest lithography machines with higher numerical aperture technology are expected to cost even more, in the range of $300 million or more per unit.
