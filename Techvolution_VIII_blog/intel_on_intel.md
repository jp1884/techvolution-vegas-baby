## Dear Intel Team

## I'm thankful

I want to thank the people at Intel. To all the support staff, technicians, programmers, engineers, chemists, physicists: your work designing and manufacturing personal computer and server microchips is amazing and way too under appreciated lately.

Just in the past few weeks your media coverage has been "COLLAPSE: Intel is Falling Apart", "The End Times of Intel", "Intel Will Never Recover", "Is Intel Actually Screwed".

The dramatic proclamations against you come from people who want faster computer games or work computers, but aren't in the kitchen dealing with countless suppliers, waiting on building permits, interpreting environmental rules, following union laws,...

All while working on an modern Manhattan Project.

Let's look at your progress. 

The first commercial transistors were made in 1960s and were the size of buttons. Nobody, not even physicists and chemists, understood why some worked and some didn't. But you took on the challenge and started and sustained Moore's Law; the observation that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles about every two years.

And so your microchip processors went from:

- 4,500 transistors in the early 1970s with the 8080 chip
- 3.2 million transistors in the early 1990s Pentium chip.
- Tens of billions of transistors in the forthcoming Panther Lake processor.

<!-- IMAGE OF INTEL's MICROPROCESSOR HISTORY -->

Transistor count is roughly means the more powerful a computer chip gets. Few other companies have contributed to our economy at such an incredible rate. And the mystery of semiconductors never really went away. In slowly morphed into trying to comprehend the enormous complexity of today's manufacturing processes.

Few people can.

It takes three months for a modern microchip to go from base silicon into a microchip. The chip goes nearly non-stop through hundreds of very specialized tools. Operating these tools require skill sets so unique their rarity and preciousness is comparable to an endangered species. 

For example lets look at lithography machines. They are like printers for computer chips. Using very precise light they transfer intricate circuit designs from templates onto the silicon wafers coated with light-sensitive material. This "prints" power lines, interconnects, and transistors onto microchips.

<!-- IMAGE OF LITHOGRAPHY MACHINE -->

As Moore's Law progressed, lithography machines needed increasingly sophisticated optical systems, smaller wavelengths, and more complex templates to keep making transistors smaller.

In the search for the next iteration, the semiconductor industry has explored at least 13 distinct lithography technologies, including proximity, projection, and electron beam (E-beam) lithography. The current state-of-the-art is High Numerical Aperture Extreme Ultraviolet lithography which costs over $400 million.

The price is so high because these new systems create features with critical dimensions below 8nm—to put this in perspective the number in 1990 was about 230nm, and a DNA molecule is approximately 2.5nm wide. 

This amazing progress cannot be taken for granted. The cost of a development is filled with twists and turns, false starts, and unrealized potential and is hitting the limits of economics and physics.

In this fog of development, Intel's ability to pack transistors onto microchips fell behind others.

As tech reporters are apt to say, the other guys make faster and more powerful microchips, perhaps being 6-12 months ahead (although the gap should close with the impending "18/14A process nodes" I'm told).

## Still In the Race

Intel wasn't always behind. You lead for many decades because Dr. Gordon Moore made scientific discovery the company's DNA, and then gave the reins to Dr. Andy Grove who instituted accountability according to his famous maxim "only the paranoid survive".

Thus, you had a long history of designing and making the best microchips. For years business and customers were effectively forced to buy from you. Some trouble emerged as you sometimes threw your weight around by stomping competition or pressuring suppliers. You even felt confident enough to reject Steve Jobs when he asked you to make the microchips for Apple's new device, the iPhone.

Then in 2015, your ability to manufacture the fastest microprocessors faltered.

It is my understanding that when the Low Numerical Aperture Extreme Ultraviolet lithography tool wasn't ready, you tried cobalt interconnects and extensive multi-patterning instead (and I'm sure countless other techniques too complex for my enthusiast brain).

It didn't work out. You got stuck in the mystery of semiconductor manufacturing and went from being years ahead to years behind in the race to keep adding more transistors to microchips.

<!-- PHOTO MASKS IMAGE -->

By this time, most other semiconductor companies closed or sold their manufacturer fabrication departments (often called "fabs"). It was just too expensive and difficult to stay in the Moore's Law race. Instead, Apple, AMD, nVidia, and others embraced being "fabless" and sent their designs to a semiconductor foundry to fabricate. 

Effectively that meant one company, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). When you problems continued for years after 2015, TSMC overtook you and with the fastest microchips along with the scale of making most of the world's chips.

When you tried to get other customers into your own foundry business, few had (technical) reasons to join up (although interest has been picking up lately). During this USA share of advanced manufacturing dropped from 50% to under 10%, and most of what was made being the often ridiculed Intel's slower microchips.

So what.

Ferrari hasn't won a F1 title in generations. The Chicago Cubs took over a century to win a championship. NASA couldn't come up with reuseable rockets.

Yet we still hope the best for these organizations, and give their people money, awards, and accolades because we understand how hard it is to achieve their goals.

Your naysayers and press followers won't do that for you. They should.

It's not that you are perfect. I'm sure those on the inside know more than anyone else the hubris, missteps, and mistakes that saw a titan become a napping rabbit.

I mean you were founded by PhDs and probably shouldn't have anyone in control who does not see the Periodic Table as a recipe book (it was a business minded CEO who rejected making the iPhones chips). I hear there are too many middle managers there (like in much of the American economy). Also, unneeded share buybacks are a bad idea in an industry as unpredictable and capital intensive as yours.

But you can still put billions of transistors on a microchip. So I just wanted to say thanks for going to work every day.

In the next blog post, we'll uncover why more people should be thankful too.

## Why "Intel" Matters, Part 2.

## What Are Not Biologists for Humans

>You can know the name of a bird in all the languages of the world, but when you're finished, you'll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird... So let's look at the bird and see what it's doing—that's what counts. I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.

_Richard P. Feynman, "What Do You Care What Other People Think?": Further Adventures of a Curious Character_

In a prior post we discussed two concepts, biologists for humans, and how Moore's Law is perhaps causing our political and economic discord by because we've been making ever more powerful tools and  don't yet know how to use them properly yet.

We can see those two concepts in this case.

The first is showcasing how a "biologist for humans" might look, using Intel.

I'm not here to defend a billion dollar corporation such as Intel, or the other American based semiconductor manufacturers such as Texas Instruments or Wolfspeed. I am here to defend the people who work together at a place we call "Intel".

And the difference there is the difference Feynman talked about.

The company of Intel has struggled. Missed out on making mobile chips, AI chips, and lost huge market share of the computer and service chips to competitors.

Hence the ridicule of tech and investor press and the population at large. One of the many comments on a youtube video was "Just when you think it can’t get worse for Intel, another news pops up"

All the while the people at Intel were making microchips critical to our future.

## What Are Biologists

"Chestnuts roasting on a open fire, Jack Frost nipping at your nose."
The Christmas Song by Mel Torme, Robert Wells

The American Chestnut was far more than just a tree. It was a pivotal species because its nuts were so nutrious and plentful they supported entire ecosystems from deer to blue jays, pigs to humans, and played a central role in the economic and cultural landscape of eastern North America.

Until a foreign fungus was introduced into late 1800s America.

Unable to combat it, about 5 billions American chestnut trees died in a few decades. Perhaps five survived. Its near-total extinction represents not just an ecological loss, but a profound disruption to an entire way of life. Forests once filled with creatures dinning on chestnuts lost out.

What did biologists do?

Biologists responded to the American Chestnut crisis by systematically investigating the blight. They identified Cryphonectria parasitica as the fungal pathogen causing widespread tree death, tracing its origin to imported Asian chestnuts. Researchers developed multiple strategies to combat the disease, including cross-breeding with blight-resistant Chinese Chestnut varieties, genetic engineering, and biological control methods. The primary goal was to develop chestnut trees that could survive the fungal infection, with modern efforts focusing on genetic modification to introduce resistance genes directly into the American Chestnut's DNA.

## What Are Biologists For Humans

Globally we produce more than a trillion computer chips per year. That's about 20 trillion transistors being created every second.

This is Moore's Law, and its changing our politics, economics, identity much faster than our biology is evolved to understand. And when computer gamers, investors, and others criticize the people at Intel for making microchips a few percentage points slower then others, it drastically misses the point.

And if Intel is effectively slowing down, unable to keep Moore's law alive and hurting... what is our reaction?



Feynman is saying science depends on the removal of human narratives so we can see the true laws of nature. We need to keep going. To keep making new chips. I doubt any of the readers knows how fast their laptop is, or how many transistors are in their microchips. Because these don't matter all that much.

More importantly, technology is not a collection of products that live in isolation only to be tested according to press benchmarks.

It's is now a living ecosystem. Expanding and changing our planet and society every second.

Smartphone does not live alone our desks or pockets, but in a complex technological ecosystem. It harvests resources interactions with users, adapts through software updates, and 'reproduces' by inspiring new device designs. Its survival depends on continuous innovation: better batteries, more powerful processors, enhanced cameras—each iteration a response to environmental pressures of human demand and technological competition.

Press, fans, observes the name of something, and not the way it interacts with its environment.

Compare this to a biologist.





And that speaks to another reason  I'm defending the people at "Intel". Evolutionary process can't be broken and something as complicated as making modern microchips is very easy to forget.

There are the commonly cited supply chain and geo-political concerns. A domestic supply of advanced microchips is critical for national security and economic resilience because these microchips are essential components in military technology, critical infrastructure, communications systems, and emerging technologies like AI, quantum computing, and advanced defense systems.

More important is something else. As Steve Jobs said, "The best way to predict the future is to invent it". There is no other way to the future than to make it. You can't buy it, or even design it, because that assumes it'll just show up based on your desires or thoughts.

Like every living species, technological products must transform raw materials—sunlight, soil, water—into resources that sustain our technological ecosystem. We actually have to turn raw materials into products. Only going through that process reveals what is possible with the resources available.

That's why the first computers were imagined from the textile looms of England (the world's most advanced), or why Henry Ford's team imagined car mass manufacturing after looking at a butchery in Chicago (again among the world's most advanced). The first semiconductor photosmasks were adapted from the printed presses of the day. Even Jobs had to see the graphical user interface (GUI) at Xerox PARC in order to invent the Macintosh.

The pint is just like in biological evolution, there can't be gaps in development. There must be a sustained link between the past, present, and future...

The people, who mostly work at Intel, know how to turn raw materials into microprocessors. We are just at the dawn of the Internet Age, and we need microprocessors.

The problems is the assumption that as long as a person is getting a product, they are in good shape and fit to criticize the delay in delivery of better products to their doorstep. But a person is not only a user, but a member to a technological ecosystem. For an ecosystem to be healthy, it must be able to build new iterations to keep evolving.

So, tech press should stop thinking of themselves as observers and instead use their skills and find the root problems impeding advanced semiconductor manufacturing in America. In a prior post we noted the huge increase in health care administrators in the American economy since 1970. We noted the rise of Moore's Law enabled this burst of regulations and administrators.

A similar large increase is noted in permitting requirements, environmental assessments, government wait times grants, long worker safety training, patent proliferation, and so much more making it hard for manufacturers, including semiconductor manufacturers, to get their work done. It's beyond the scope of this blog to investigate these impediments, but for a quick reference here is a quote from Walter Issacson's book The Innovators, "In 2011 a milestone was reached: Apple and Google spent more on lawsuits and payments involving patents than they did on research and development of new products."

Ironically, like a thicket, Moore's Law created the means for us to increase administration cost so much, its strangling its own ecosystem to death.

The naysayers should be among those "biologists" in the field and in the lab, observing our technological ecosystem and noting its problems and issues and good spots.

After all, the people at "Intel" invented the microprocessor, USB, PCIe, and countless other stuff our economy needs. These workers face endless hours turning raw materials into our digital lifeblood and therefore deserve our respect and thanks.

If this sounds like wishful thinking, think of this, as it stands the USA is going to have spent billions birthing the Internet Age products and technology, and struggle end up with no way of making its own microchips. And that's scary. Because like in biology, once a skill set is gone, it goes extinct. And the rest of use who co-evolved with it usually aren't far away.


- By removing human narratives around names and preconceived notions about supposed value, and just observing a species behaviors, relationships, and environmental impacts and then giving names to the facets of nature we unlock.

## Techvolution

Globally we produce more than a trillion computer chips per year. That's about 20 trillion transistors being created every second.

To understand ourselves in this new technological era, we need a new paradigm. One that puts technology at the forefront of our identities, politics, and economics.

Until we change our mindsets, we'll go on using increasingly powerful technology with outdated biological instincts. 

But recognizing this mismatch also points toward a solution. 

What if we applied evolutionary principles to understand how civilizations adapt to new technological environments? The same forces that have guided life for billions of years might show us how to thrive in our digital age instead of being torn apart by it. 

I've been exploring this evolutionary framework for our technological civilization, and the early findings are promising. If you're curious about this approach to our modern struggles, you can read more at books.techvolution.org. 

This blog will continue examining how we might consciously evolve beyond our current political and social breakdown. Because if transistors helped create these problems, understanding technological evolution might help us solve them.

## P.S.

- does it matter? what are we racing against that overcomes geopolitical, supply chain, and proximity? yes i know there is expertise but getting the iPhone 23 a year after the current timeline is a change likely to shut down our economy...

- it would require a book to fully flesh the message out (especially for anyone who believes in "comparative advantage"). We don't think of our technological ecosystem as something needing study, management, and care. But we still need it, so we act out using emotions instead of reason....

- it exposes what may be the fatal flaw of western liberal democracies. you can't win and your ecosystem lose. meaning you're victory must be a local material one, and not because of legal ownership of a far away place...no lion can be a king because of a foriegn jungle.

- you can't cheer for a brand like we do "teams" in a sporting event, because teams are organized and everyone always gets another chance. brands are really infrastructure and everyone should be cheering, and supporting, their bridges, buildings, and manufacturers to succeed. Otherwise, you're just assuming someone else will do your work for you and not take advantage of you.

- USA is going to spend billions on AI and this and that, and end up with not a single way of making a chip.

 - industry folk, you're competing yourself to death. literally, you're exported away. why is waiting and being a little more patient for the next node such a big deal...?

## Why so serious?

Since its emergence, semiconductor lithography has witnessed no fewer than 11 distinct attempts to introduce new tool technologies (see table). Tlie intnxluction of these tools has enahled many advances in the semiconductor industry. While the forward progress of the industry is beyond question, this progress has been punctuated by numerous false starts and cases of unrealized potential.

## Lithography machines

### Intro

Semiconductor lithography machines are critical tools used in the manufacturing of semiconductor devices, especially microchips. Their main purpose is to transfer intricate circuit patterns onto silicon wafers, which form the foundational structures of integrated circuits used in electronics like smartphones and computers.

The process works by projecting light through a photomask or reticle, which contains the blueprint of the circuit pattern. This pattern is then reduced and precisely focused onto a silicon wafer coated with a photosensitive material called photoresist. The exposure alters the photoresist in specific areas according to the pattern, allowing subsequent steps to etch the actual circuit onto the wafer.

There are several types of lithography machines based on the light source used:

Optical lithography (photolithography) uses ultraviolet (UV) light for pattern projection, widely used for larger feature sizes.

Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography employs much shorter wavelength light (13 nm) to create finer, smaller, and more complex patterns necessary for advanced microchips.

Electron beam lithography, which uses focused electron beams rather than light, offers extremely high precision mainly for research and prototyping but is slower for mass production.

Key components of these machines include the light source (UV, EUV, or electron beam), photomasks/reticles for patterning, and wafer stages to hold and precisely position the silicon wafer during exposure.

These lithography machines enable the production of smaller, faster, and more efficient microchips by allowing very fine, high-density transistor layouts. They are fundamental in pushing forward electronic device performance, supporting AI, IoT, and other advanced technologies by fabricating complex semiconductor devices.

In essence, semiconductor lithography equipment is the cornerstone technology that drives the creation of the micro-scale electrical patterns necessary to build integrated circuits powering modern electronics.

### Cost 

Present day litho tools cost ~$50-$80 million. But in a high volume manufacturing
(HVM) environment, such as a chip making factory, they operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, at > 90 % up time, generally for at least 5 years. A state-of-theart 193 nm wavelength litho tool requires only about 20 seconds to 30 seconds to completely expose a 300 mm diameter silicon wafer. This corresponds to a “throughput” of ~120 to ~180 wafers per hour. Thus, during its 5 year lifetime, a tool will expose on the order of 5 million wafers which amortizes the $50-80 million tool cost to only about $10-$16 per full-wafer exposure. A fully patterned 300 mm diameter wafer will yield a few hundred to a few thousand microchips depending on the chip size. For a chip requiring 30 exposures to complete it, the tool cost contributes from only a few cents to a few dollars to the cost of each chip. 

https://appliedmathsolutions.com/pdf/Common_Misconceptions_about_Photolithography_141009.pdf

### Development History

Notable make and models of semiconductor lithography machines during their development, especially from the dominant player ASML, include:

PAS 2000 (1980s): ASML's first system, inherited from Philips and initially sold under the name ASM Lithography. It faced early challenges including oil-based hydraulics unsuitable for cleanrooms and limited commercial success.

PAS 5500 (1990s): Became a widely adopted stepper system by ASML that allowed for smaller chip features with improved alignment and throughput. Many of these older systems remain operational today.

TWINSCAN Series (2001 onward): Introduced dual-stage technology that increased throughput by simultaneously exposing one wafer while aligning the next. This series includes models like:

TWINSCAN AT:1150i (first immersion lithography machine, 2003)

TWINSCAN XT:1700i (first volume immersion production, 2006)

TWINSCAN XT:1900i (industry highest numerical aperture of 1.35, 2007)

TWINSCAN NXT and NXT:1950i (major immersion lithography systems enabling chip feature sizes down to 32 nm)

TWINSCAN NXE Series (EUV lithography, 2010s–present): These machines utilize extreme ultraviolet light (~13.5 nm wavelength) to produce much finer patterns. Notable models include:

NXE:3100 (early commercial EUV)

NXE:3350B

NXE:3600D (best-selling model, extremely complex and costly)

High-NA EUV Systems (Launching 2023-2025): Next-generation EUV lithography machines with higher numerical aperture (0.55 vs. 0.33) for even finer resolution. First shipments went to Intel in 2023 and TSMC in late 2024.

### Estimated Prices

ASML PAS 2000 (1980s): The PAS 2000 was ASML's first system launched in 1984. Early on, the project required about 120 million Dutch guilders (roughly €245 million in today's money) for development and production scale-up. However, the actual sale prices in the early 1980s were far lower per unit, but precise data isn't widely documented.

ASML PAS 5500 (1990s): This machine became wildly successful and helped ASML emerge as a market leader. In the 1990s, lithography tools similar to PAS 5500 were priced around tens of millions of dollars per unit, with a typical estimate for advanced steppers in the $10 million to $30 million range.

ASML TWINSCAN Immersion Systems (2000s): These featured major technological advancements like water immersion to improve feature resolution. Prices for top-end immersion lithography scanners during the 2000s to early 2010s ranged from approximately $30 million to $60 million per system depending on the model and capabilities.

ASML NXE EUV Lithography Systems (2010s–present): EUV machines are among the world's most expensive semiconductor equipment. ASML EUV tools typically cost approximately $150 million to $250 million per system.

ASML Next-Generation High-NA EUV Systems (Launching 2023-2025): These newest lithography machines with higher numerical aperture technology are expected to cost even more, in the range of $300 million or more per unit.
