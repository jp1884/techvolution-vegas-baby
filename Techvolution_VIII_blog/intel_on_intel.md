## Dear Intel Team

## I'm thankful

I want to thank the people at Intel. To the over one hundred thousand support staff, technicians, programmers, engineers, chemists, and physicists who work there: your job designing and manufacturing personal computer and server microchips is amazing and way too under appreciated lately.

Just in the past few weeks your media coverage has been "Is Intel Actually Screwed", "COLLAPSE: Intel is Falling Apart", "The End Times of Intel", "Intel Will Never Recover".

The dramatic proclamations against you come from people who want faster computers every year, but aren't in the kitchen dealing with countless suppliers, waiting on building permits, interpreting environmental rules, following union laws,...

All while working on a modern Manhattan Project.

Let's look back at your progress. 

The first commercial transistors were made in 1960s and were the size of buttons. Nobody, not even physicists and chemists, understood why some worked and some didn't. But you took on the challenge and started and sustained Moore's Law; the observation that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles about every two years.

Adding more transistors means a more powerful computer chip. And so it's good that your microchip processors went from:

- 4,500 transistors in the early 1970s with the 8080 chip
- 3.2 million transistors in the early 1990s Pentium chip.
- Tens of billions of transistors in the forthcoming Panther Lake processor.

<!-- IMAGE OF INTEL's MICROPROCESSOR HISTORY -->

Few other companies have contributed to our economy at such an incredible rate. But the mystery of semiconductors never really went away. In time the difficulty slowly morphed into trying to comprehend the enormous complexity of the manufacturing processes.

Few people can. 

Today, it takes three months for a modern microchip to go from base silicon into a finished product. All the while the microchip goes nearly non-stop through hundreds of very specialized tools. Operating these tools require skill sets so unique their rarity and preciousness is comparable to an endangered species. 

For example, let's look at lithography machines. They are like printers for computer chips. Using very precise beams of light, these machines transfer intricate circuit designs from templates onto the silicon wafers coated with light-sensitive material. This "prints" transistors, and the power lines and interconnects they depend on, onto microchips.

<!-- IMAGE OF LITHOGRAPHY MACHINE -->

As Moore's Law progressed, lithography machines needed increasingly sophisticated optical systems, smaller light wavelengths, and more complex templates to keep making transistors smaller.

In the search for the next iteration, the semiconductor industry has explored at least 13 distinct lithography technologies, including proximity, projection, and electron beam (E-beam) lithography. The current state-of-the-art is High Numerical Aperture Extreme Ultraviolet lithography, and one machine costs over $400 million.

The price is so high because these new systems create features with critical dimensions below 8nm—to put this in perspective the number in 1990 was about 230nm, and a human DNA molecule is approximately 2.5nm wide. 

This amazing progress cannot be taken for granted. The cost of a development is filled with twists and turns, false starts, and is today nearing the limits of economics and physics. 

In this fog of development, Intel's ability to pack transistors onto microchips fell behind others.

As tech reporters are apt to say, the other guys make faster microchips with more transistors, perhaps being 6-12 months ahead (although the gap should close with the impending "18/14A process nodes" I'm told).

And because of this misstep, Intel got the scorn from the community it helped start.

## Still in the Race

Intel wasn't always behind. Its workers lead for many decades because their founder Dr. Gordon Moore made scientific discovery the company's DNA. And then he gave the reins to Dr. Andy Grove who instituted accountability according to his famous maxim "only the paranoid survive".

Thus, you had a long history of designing and making the best microchips. For years business and customers were effectively forced to buy from you.

Some trouble emerged as you sometimes threw your weight around by stomping competition or over pressuring suppliers for better deals. You even felt confident enough to reject Steve Jobs when he asked you to make the microchips for Apple's new device, the iPhone.

Then in 2015, your ability to manufacture the fastest microprocessors faltered.

It is my understanding that when the Low Numerical Aperture Extreme Ultraviolet lithography tool wasn't ready, you tried cobalt interconnects and extensive multi-patterning instead (and I'm sure countless other techniques too complex for my enthusiast brain).

It didn't work out. You got stuck in the mystery of semiconductor manufacturing and went from being years ahead to years behind in the race of Moore's Law.

<!-- PHOTO MASKS IMAGE -->

By this time, most other semiconductor companies closed or sold their manufacturer fabrication departments (called "fabs"). It had become too expensive and difficult to stay in the Moore's Law race. Instead, Apple, AMD, nVidia, and others embraced being "fabless" and sent their designs to a semiconductor foundry to fabricate. 

Effectively that meant one company, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). When Intel's problems continued for years after 2015, TSMC overtook you, gaining both the fastest microchips and the scale of making most of the world's chips.

When you tried to get other customers into your own foundry business, few had (technical) reasons to join up (although interest has been picking up lately). During this USA share of advanced manufacturing dropped from 40% to under 10%. And most of that 10% was the often ridiculed Intel's slower microchips.

How silly.

Ferrari hasn't won a F1 title in generations. The Chicago Cubs took over a century to win a championship. NASA couldn't come up with reuseable rockets.

Yet we still hope the best for these organizations, and give their people money, awards, and accolades because we understand how hard it is to achieve their goals.

Your naysayers and press followers won't do that for you. They should.

It's not that you are perfect. I'm sure those on the inside know more than anyone else the hubris, missteps, and mistakes that saw a titan become a napping rabbit.

I mean you were founded by PhDs and probably shouldn't have anyone in control who does not see the Periodic Table as a recipe book (it was a business minded CEO who rejected making the iPhones chips). I hear there are too many middle managers there (like in much of the American economy). Also, share buybacks are a bad idea in an industry as unpredictable and capital intensive as yours.

But you can still put billions of transistors on a microchip. So I just wanted to say thanks for going to work every day.

In the next blog post, we'll uncover why more people should be thankful too.

## Why "Intel" Matters, Part 2.

## What Are Not Biologists for Humans

>You can know the name of a bird in all the languages of the world, but when you're finished, you'll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird... So let's look at the bird and see what it's doing—that's what counts. I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.

_Richard P. Feynman, "What Do You Care What Other People Think?": Further Adventures of a Curious Character_

In a prior post we discussed two concepts, biologists for humans, and how Moore's Law is causing our political and economic discord by making ever more powerful tools that we don't yet know how to use properly.

We can flesh out these two concepts using the case of semiconductor manufacturing.

The first is showcasing how a "biologist for humans" thinks about Intel.

I'm not here to defend a billion dollar corporation such as Intel, or the other American based semiconductor manufacturers such as Texas Instruments or Wolfspeed. I am here to defend the people who work together at a place we call "Intel".

And the difference there is the difference Feynman talked about.

The company of Intel has struggled. It once made most of the world's advanced microprocessors, and then missed out on making mobile smartphone chips and AI chips while losing half its huge market share of the lucrative home computer and service chips to competitors.

Hence the ridicule of tech and investor press and the population at large.

And yet, I doubt most computer users would have any idea what microchips are in their computers or servers, and would hardly notice the 1-10% difference in performance from using Intel's locally manufactured microchips.

Those labeling Intel workers as 'losers' were dismissing the only group of people in our society manufacturing the microchips we need—all over performance differences most people would never notice, especially since Intel eventually overcame its slump within five years.

In short these observers saw a disease and blamed the victims, ie the workers of a failing technology. A biologist would never do that. Here's how they respond to problems in the natural world.

## What Are Biologists

> "Chestnuts roasting on a open fire, Jack Frost nipping at your nose."

_The Christmas Song by Mel Torme, Robert Wells_

For thousands of years, the American Chestnut was more than just a tree - it was a vital part of the ecosystem in eastern North America. Its large and nutritious nuts supported a wide range of wildlife, from deer and blue jays to pigs and humans. The tree's wood was also highly valued for its durability and versatility, making it a key material for homes and furniture-making. For all these reasons the American Chestnut played a central role in the region's ecology, economy, and culture.

Until a fungus blight came in the late 1800s.

Unable to combat it, about 5 billion American chestnut trees died in a few decades. Scientists think perhaps five trees survived. This near-total extinction represents not just an ecological loss, but a profound disruption to an entire way of life.

Forests once filled with creatures dining on chestnuts are much quieter today; Americans can only sing about roasting chestnuts over open fires.

What did biologists do?

They responded to the American Chestnut crisis by systematically investigating the problem.

Even in the relatively primitive early 1900s, biologists identified Cryphonectria parasitica as the fungal pathogen causing widespread tree death, tracing its origin to imported Asian chestnuts. Early researchers developed multiple strategies to combat the disease, including cross-breeding with blight-resistant Chinese Chestnut varieties, genetic engineering, and biological control methods. The primary goal was to develop chestnut trees that could survive the fungal infection. Modern efforts use new tools such as genetic modification to introduce resistance genes directly into the American Chestnut's DNA.

Progress has been slow, but today government and non-profits are breeding and planting blight resistant American chestnut saplings throughout America and Canada. It'll take many years to see it again throughout the forests, but progress is being made, and fingers crossed, we are on the way to saving the species.

Biologists did this because they did not see the "sparrow", i.e. the human narrative we give to describe events which so easily brings superstition and blame.

Instead, biologists saw the problem, investigated it, and implemented a solution.

In comparison, when we see American semiconductor manufacturing suffering, we saw the problem from within the confines of human narratives.

When gamers complained about lost speed to their gaming PCs, or investors lost growth to their portfolios, it was "Intel's problem", as if the product of approx 100,000 people's work doing extremely advanced work, need not be understood and given some patience.

It's comparable to our ancestors who might have seen the wilting American Chestnut and said the gods were responsible.

Instead, we should have seen a sickness inside the technological ecosystem, and responded as biologists do. 

Just as biologists study ecosystems—understanding how species interact, adapt, and sometimes struggle within their environment—we need to approach our technological world with the same systematic thinking. 

Intel's challenges aren't isolated corporate failures; they're symptoms within a complex technological ecosystem where companies, workers, suppliers, and innovations all interconnect. When one part of this system faces stress, a biologist's approach would be to investigate the underlying causes rather than simply assign blame

Once we do this, we'll start being a "biologists for humans" means.

In the next blog post, we'll starting do that.

# POST THREE

## Why "Intel" Matters, Part 3.

## What Are Biologists For Humans

Globally we produce more than a trillion computer chips per year. That's about 20 trillion transistors being created every second.

For comparison, the Apollo 11 spacecraft that landed us on the Moon in 1969 had about 40,000 transistors.

This exponential growth represents the power of Moore's Law, and it's changing our politics, economics, identity, and environment much faster than our biology evolved to understand. This mismatch requires us to think like 'biologists for humans'—people who study our technological ecosystem with the same systematic approach biologists use in nature.

A biologist for humans realizes modern technology is no longer a collection of products, but a living ecosystem we depend on and co-evolve with.

Like biological species, each tool must continuously adapt, harvest resources, and evolve to survive inside its ecosystem. Just as a biologist studies an organism's behaviors, environmental interactions, and reproductive health (see American Chestnut), we must study technology as a dynamic, interconnected system constantly reshaping the human experience.

So, when computer gamers, investors, customers, and others criticize the people at Intel for making microchips a few percentage points slower than others, it drastically misses the point.

Because if Americans are struggling in making transistors we desperately need, we shouldn't mock the trees for making less chestnuts each year.

We should identify and rectify the blight. Keeping Moore's Law's prediction of doubling transistors every two years is not nearly as important as simply continuing to make advanced transistors.

Following Feynman's advice, we should replace human narratives focused on Intel's people with an understanding of what's actually happening in our technological ecosystem. Tech reviewers, investors, and all of us should investigate the technological environment to identify systemic problems. This is what it means to be "biologists for humans".

For one, we could write better software. Any programmer will admit today's software is often horribly inefficient. Because computer chips keep getting so much faster, programmers don't need to emphasize optimal code. Fixing the programming problem will put less pressure on semiconductor manufacturers to keep improving so fast.

There's a lot of other ways to help too.

In a prior post we noted the huge increase in health care administrators in the American economy since 1970.

A similar large increase has been noted in permitting requirements, environmental assessments, government grant wait times, overly long worker safety training, frivolous patent proliferation, and so much more making it hard for manufacturers, including semiconductor manufacturers, to get their work done.

It's beyond the scope of this blog to investigate these impediments, but for a quick reference here is a quote from Walter Issacson's book The Innovators, "In 2011 a milestone was reached: Apple and Google spent more on lawsuits and payments involving patents than they did on research and development of new products."

With all the power of digital technology to make paperwork, it has ironically created a sort of thicket of administration that it's strangling its own ecosystem to death.

And we can't solve the problem by importing foreign made microchips. The reason is seen inside simple evolution.

As Steve Jobs said, "The best way to predict the future is to invent it". There is no other way to the future than to make it. You can't buy it, or even design it, because that assumes your desires or thoughts are perfect.

We need to actually mix our thoughts with the available raw materials. Only going through that process reveals what is needed and possible with the resources available.

That's why the first computers were imagined from the textile looms of England (the world's most advanced), or why Henry Ford's team imagined car mass manufacturing after looking at a butchery in Chicago (again among the world's most advanced). Even Jobs had to see the graphical user interface (GUI) at Xerox PARC in order to invent the Macintosh, the first modern personal computer.

For all these reasons, we should cherish the people at "Intel".

It was they who invented the microprocessor, USB, PCIe, and countless other stuff our economy now depends on. These workers face endless hours turning raw materials into our digital lifeblood and therefore deserve our respect and thanks.

As already mentioned, there are hundreds of tools in the semiconductor manufacturing process. There's no way any single country could supply each specialized tool in this complex process. The problem isn't so much that America isn't making microchips, but that it's unable to do so due to a sort of technical blight. The tech press, and others, who've noted this decline, should make note of that.

They of course do in some regards. When a quality product or earnings report is released, the narrative changes quickly. But that again is still interpreting technological events through human narratives of product review and investor expectations, which Feynman told us is misleading. Once the 'crop' of products falls behind expectations, it's back to neglect instead of investigation and assistance, as a biologist would provide.

If this sort of enlightenment sounds like wishful thinking, think of this, as it stands the USA is going to have spent many billions birthing the Internet Age products and technology, and is now getting close to have no way of supplying its own microchips. And that's scary. Because like in biology, once a skill set is gone, it goes extinct. And the rest of us who co-evolved with it will inevitably suffer.

Understanding our role as 'biologists for humans' requires a new paradigm—one that recognizes we're not just technology users, but participants in a technological ecosystem that demands the same careful stewardship we give to natural environments.

## Techvolution

The blight on our microchip manufacturing is not from a foreign country, as it was for the unfortunate American Chestnut, but a foreign time period. We are using biological instincts and ideological beliefs suited to a pre-technological age.

To understand ourselves in this new technological era, we need a new paradigm. One that puts technology at the forefront of our identities, politics, and economics.

Until we change our mindsets, we'll go on using increasingly powerful technology with outdated biological instincts. 

But recognizing this mismatch also points toward a solution. 

What if we applied evolutionary principles to understand how civilizations adapt to new technological environments? The same forces that have guided life for billions of years might show us how to thrive in our digital age instead of being torn apart by it. 

I've been exploring this evolutionary framework for our technological civilization, and the early findings are promising. If you're curious about this approach to our modern struggles, you can read more at books.techvolution.org. 

This blog will continue examining how we might consciously evolve beyond our current political and social breakdown. Because if transistors helped create these problems, understanding technological evolution might help us solve them.


# P.S.

- does it matter? what are we racing against that overcomes geopolitical, supply chain, and proximity? yes i know there is expertise but getting the iPhone 23 a year after the current timeline is a change likely to shut down our economy...

- it would require a book to fully flesh the message out (especially for anyone who believes in "comparative advantage"). We don't think of our technological ecosystem as something needing study, management, and care. But we still need it, so we act out using emotions instead of reason....

- it exposes what may be the fatal flaw of western liberal democracies. you can't win and your ecosystem lose. meaning you're victory must be a local material one, and not because of legal ownership of a far away place...no lion can be a king because of a foriegn jungle.

- you can't cheer for a brand like we do "teams" in a sporting event, because teams are organized and everyone always gets another chance. brands are really infrastructure and everyone should be cheering, and supporting, their bridges, buildings, and manufacturers to succeed. Otherwise, you're just assuming someone else will do your work for you and not take advantage of you.

- USA is going to spend billions on AI and this and that, and end up with not a single way of making a chip.

 - industry folk, you're competing yourself to death. literally, you're exported away. why is waiting and being a little more patient for the next node such a big deal...?

## Why so serious?

Since its emergence, semiconductor lithography has witnessed no fewer than 11 distinct attempts to introduce new tool technologies (see table). Tlie intnxluction of these tools has enahled many advances in the semiconductor industry. While the forward progress of the industry is beyond question, this progress has been punctuated by numerous false starts and cases of unrealized potential.

## Lithography machines

### Intro

Semiconductor lithography machines are critical tools used in the manufacturing of semiconductor devices, especially microchips. Their main purpose is to transfer intricate circuit patterns onto silicon wafers, which form the foundational structures of integrated circuits used in electronics like smartphones and computers.

The process works by projecting light through a photomask or reticle, which contains the blueprint of the circuit pattern. This pattern is then reduced and precisely focused onto a silicon wafer coated with a photosensitive material called photoresist. The exposure alters the photoresist in specific areas according to the pattern, allowing subsequent steps to etch the actual circuit onto the wafer.

There are several types of lithography machines based on the light source used:

Optical lithography (photolithography) uses ultraviolet (UV) light for pattern projection, widely used for larger feature sizes.

Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography employs much shorter wavelength light (13 nm) to create finer, smaller, and more complex patterns necessary for advanced microchips.

Electron beam lithography, which uses focused electron beams rather than light, offers extremely high precision mainly for research and prototyping but is slower for mass production.

Key components of these machines include the light source (UV, EUV, or electron beam), photomasks/reticles for patterning, and wafer stages to hold and precisely position the silicon wafer during exposure.

These lithography machines enable the production of smaller, faster, and more efficient microchips by allowing very fine, high-density transistor layouts. They are fundamental in pushing forward electronic device performance, supporting AI, IoT, and other advanced technologies by fabricating complex semiconductor devices.

In essence, semiconductor lithography equipment is the cornerstone technology that drives the creation of the micro-scale electrical patterns necessary to build integrated circuits powering modern electronics.

### Cost 

Present day litho tools cost ~$50-$80 million. But in a high volume manufacturing
(HVM) environment, such as a chip making factory, they operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, at > 90 % up time, generally for at least 5 years. A state-of-theart 193 nm wavelength litho tool requires only about 20 seconds to 30 seconds to completely expose a 300 mm diameter silicon wafer. This corresponds to a “throughput” of ~120 to ~180 wafers per hour. Thus, during its 5 year lifetime, a tool will expose on the order of 5 million wafers which amortizes the $50-80 million tool cost to only about $10-$16 per full-wafer exposure. A fully patterned 300 mm diameter wafer will yield a few hundred to a few thousand microchips depending on the chip size. For a chip requiring 30 exposures to complete it, the tool cost contributes from only a few cents to a few dollars to the cost of each chip.

### Development History

Notable make and models of semiconductor lithography machines during their development, especially from the dominant player ASML, include:

PAS 2000 (1980s): ASML's first system, inherited from Philips and initially sold under the name ASM Lithography. It faced early challenges including oil-based hydraulics unsuitable for cleanrooms and limited commercial success.

PAS 5500 (1990s): Became a widely adopted stepper system by ASML that allowed for smaller chip features with improved alignment and throughput. Many of these older systems remain operational today.

TWINSCAN Series (2001 onward): Introduced dual-stage technology that increased throughput by simultaneously exposing one wafer while aligning the next. This series includes models like:

TWINSCAN AT:1150i (first immersion lithography machine, 2003)

TWINSCAN XT:1700i (first volume immersion production, 2006)

TWINSCAN XT:1900i (industry highest numerical aperture of 1.35, 2007)

TWINSCAN NXT and NXT:1950i (major immersion lithography systems enabling chip feature sizes down to 32 nm)

TWINSCAN NXE Series (EUV lithography, 2010s–present): These machines utilize extreme ultraviolet light (~13.5 nm wavelength) to produce much finer patterns. Notable models include:

NXE:3100 (early commercial EUV)

NXE:3350B

NXE:3600D (best-selling model, extremely complex and costly)

High-NA EUV Systems (Launching 2023-2025): Next-generation EUV lithography machines with higher numerical aperture (0.55 vs. 0.33) for even finer resolution. First shipments went to Intel in 2023 and TSMC in late 2024.

### Estimated Prices

ASML PAS 2000 (1980s): The PAS 2000 was ASML's first system launched in 1984. Early on, the project required about 120 million Dutch guilders (roughly €245 million in today's money) for development and production scale-up. However, the actual sale prices in the early 1980s were far lower per unit, but precise data isn't widely documented.

ASML PAS 5500 (1990s): This machine became wildly successful and helped ASML emerge as a market leader. In the 1990s, lithography tools similar to PAS 5500 were priced around tens of millions of dollars per unit, with a typical estimate for advanced steppers in the $10 million to $30 million range.

ASML TWINSCAN Immersion Systems (2000s): These featured major technological advancements like water immersion to improve feature resolution. Prices for top-end immersion lithography scanners during the 2000s to early 2010s ranged from approximately $30 million to $60 million per system depending on the model and capabilities.

ASML NXE EUV Lithography Systems (2010s–present): EUV machines are among the world's most expensive semiconductor equipment. ASML EUV tools typically cost approximately $150 million to $250 million per system.

ASML Next-Generation High-NA EUV Systems (Launching 2023-2025): These newest lithography machines with higher numerical aperture technology are expected to cost even more, in the range of $300 million or more per unit.
