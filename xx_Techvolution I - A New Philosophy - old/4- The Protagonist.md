# CHAPTER THREE - THE PROTAGONIST

## Your Story

Are you happy? It's an important question. Even though you may think you're just a person, so who cares, you're actually very imporant. You're special. We've found out, that every microstory is connect by their ruling philosophy, to grand story of human life on Eden, byway of technological inventions and adoptions that fight evil. Even though everyone's the protagonist inside their microstory, so they always think they're fighting evil. However, life has a distinct divide between good and evil. Like Sophia teaching Douglass to read, it's supposed to feel good living microstory inside.

So are you happy? I'm not asking in a small way. I'm asking in a big way. Is your life, happy? Do you spend lots of time with friends and family. Are you debt free. Can you quit your job. Does your work give you dignity. Have you experienced love. Is your livelihood secure. Do you raise your children. Are you following your passion. Would you watch your life if it was on Netflix. Whatever it means to you, do you happily live your life?

If a ruling philosophy is a good story, you should see the reason for being a character inside it. Our ancestors during times like the American Revolution or The Great Depression, all understood what they were doing and why. That's why they fought the British, or struggled through poverty in millions of micro-stories that made this world better. Even during those extreme times, maybe because of those extreme times, the ruling philosophy made sense to them, and therefore they accepted it was up to their own character to survive or thrive inside their grand story.

So let's re-ask the question of your happiness this way. If you think of your relationship with society now; things like the cost of food, shelter, and transportation, how much your vote matters, when you see your friends, what your boss gets paid, how we care for the environment, are you really chained to your desk. These things, and others, are our way of life. Are you happy with the connection between your micro-story and your society's grand story?

You should be asking this, because the nobility is happy with the ruling philosophy, and thinks your happy too. They actually take it for granted. But I doubt you've really asked yourself, "am I happy?". You assume the ruling philosophy is good, because it rules you. But your happiness should rule it. Like in every relationship, happiness is a two way street. Asking if you're happy is a better question than asking if you're enraged. The former moves you to techvolution, the latter towards revolution.

## You Make It, or You Don't Have

Here's a side story. A cautionary tale so you take the question of _your_ happiness very seriously. When you're asked "are you happy", you should realize your story, your own micro-story, is not by accident. Yours, and everyone's, is included into the woven tapestry of life guided by a ruling philosophy.

So please don't think you're life will change unless you change our ruling philosophy of liberal free-market economics. You might get a promotion, might get into Harvard, might win the lottery, but your way of life will not change. You'll still drive in traffic. Will still vote once every few years. Will still need a lawyer to understand your own laws. Will still live on a street full of strangers. Will still need to borrow huge sums of money to be considered educated. And your kids will have the same life.

Today's nobility will not change society. Just like how the Scientific Revolution, American and French Revolutions, and Industrial Revolutions made huge improvements to society's DNA using new technology, digital technology is waiting to be inserted into our DNA. Yet, without a revolution, it's waiting vacant. You can try to sell modern technology to an old bureaucracy or corporation to see the nobility's inability to do basic upgrades. But here's a easier, and more drastic way to see how psychologically committed antagonists are.

You read about King Charles I. The king who was beheaded rather than apologize. We're using King Charles again to showcase how political nobles couldn't understand any objections to their rule because they didn't understand their role, and every role, in the story of life ends when life finds a technology to replace a person's title.

Meaning, once peace and security returned to western Europe, the nobility's storyline ended. Thus, the nobility should have proactively done what Rousseau said, and return to being equal members of a peaceful, self-governing, democratic, society. They didn't of course. And history used many violent revolutions to right that wrong.

Charles had a speech impediment. Often called a stammer or studder. No one then, or even now, understands what causes it. It's like a gremlin holding an electrical cord connecting your thoughts and your tongue; sometimes the electricity flows, and sometimes it doesn't. In practice this means some words are easy to say, some are ~~difficult~~ hard, and some decide which at the last mili-mili-mili-second.

Talking with a stutter is like playing guitar, except the music notes are written on the fly. The randomness of sayable, non sayable, and maybe sayable, rush toward the speaker in ral time. Fail and you stutter. And far worst is getting  _that_ look from people, the "what the fuck is wrong with you?" look. Succeed and people hear the wonderful music of smooth talking.

Hello, my ~~name~~ I go by John-ne. I wa-want ~~can~~ want to help ~~master~~ destroy revolutions. I've been ~~writ~~ trying to write this book for ~~about~~ ah ~~five~~ six months...

The prospect of talking, except to yourself and a dog, which Charles had two of, causes huge anxiety as you can imagine. _The King's Speech_ showed it well. The impediment usually forces a person to be shy, passive, eager to please, and come up with weired reasons for their erratic speaking like hand gestures, random silence, and swear words (which for some reason never cause a stutter). It's entirely possible King Charles' relationship with Parliament was so bad because he simply didn't want to talk with them. Not that he would ever admit he had a problem. After all, he was a king!

I know this all because luckily enough (kidding) I have the same affliction as King Charles. It was the reason I got a job in a car insurance claim department. After a Vice President at an old company secretly told my supervisor I wasn't allowed to talk to customers, for fear of embarrasing the company, I was like shit I guess I don't have this damn gremlin under control. I wasn't even that mad about it (although I was that they were not upfront). I never told anyone I had the impediment, so despite therapy as a kid, it was obviously still a problem.

So fuck it. Jump into the deep end and sink or swim. A car insurance claim call-centre was like the Olympic trials for a stutterer. So I jumped in and had a daily workout of huge emotional outbursts from customers, all day phone calls, customer service expectations, no "outs" like swear words, booze, or wonky behavior to hide behind.

And it was far worse then I thought. The insurance company would ring a monotone digital "bell" all day because... I don't know, to de-sensitize us to customers pleas for more money, or to bully us maybe. Management used it as punishment; "answer more phone calls or we'll make the bell louder!". I'm being serious by the way. Back then, car adjusters were often more stressed then the person who just had a car crash.

Whatever the reason, DING-DING-DING-DING all day. No apps. No machine learning. Just that motherfucking bell that gave people who weren't stutterers huge anxiety, breakdowns, sick leaves; one guy had a frickin heart attack. The worst part was only being given fax machines, email, and voicemail to coordinate car accident claims. Everyday was like the stock market crashed, and you're the low level employee taking unending phone calls about people's retirement.

Here's a scene.

INT: DESK - CLAIM OFFICE CALL CENTRE - DAY

A sea of cubicles. Adjusters wear headsets while typing away on keyboards. They TALK, and sometimes, YELL.

JOHN
(answers call)
Thank you for calling claims, my name is John, how can I help you?

CALLER
Are you the asshole that's trying to steal my car!

DING-DING-DING-DING-DING

MANAGER
Hurry up!

END SCENE.

40 times a day with calls. Many were actually nice, but nice calls last a minute or two, the bad ones last hours.

Super-shock speech therapy! After about a year I didn't have to massage my jaws at night to release it from all the teeth shattering jaw-clenches I did to divert vocal stuttering. I was cured!

The point is this. That's what I took for me to mostly now, never really stutter (except for situations like boardrooms or anywhere else where pretenious cultures limit my word options.). It's like night and day. A hidden personality was brought out and frankly is fun, although still weird, to be.

Yet Charles never had this lesson. He was famoulsy shy, quiet, and anxious his whole life because that's the personality the gremlin superimposes onto you. Even when fighting a 10 year war defending his "noble right" to govern England, Charles still probably had to massage his strained jaws every night. I can sympathize. The gremlin is a bully.

After he lost the civil war Charles was tried in court. He was accused of being "a Tyrant, A Traitor, Murderer, and a public enemy to the Commonwealth of England". The prosecutors said Charles didn't have a "divine right to rule" and asked for the death penalty. Charles wouldn't even acknowledge the charges, the trial, or his judges. His life was on an actual chopping block, and he just ignored the possibility of being guilty of anything.

Charles wasn't pretending or bluffing. He wasn't proud, or stubborn. He psychologically couldn't understand even the idea of being wrong. He was a noble. Noble's rule. God said so. Who is anyone to question God? It was so simple to the king. Charles was an antagonist who thought he was the hero.

The judges convicted Charles anyway. He was sentenced to death by removing the head from the body. Charles was flabbergasted, and finally spoke in his defense. Fuck the ringing bell of a claims department, or the yelling customers, Charles only had words to save his life! His Kingdom! Speak or die Charles. Go! And... and... no stutter. Not once!

Charles freely, openely, spoke the music of his mind.

He didn't just speak, he spoke so eloquently many people, even those who hated him, were impressed. He spoke so well, so clearly, people heard no gremlin! Fuck... I'm happy for him. It must have felt like so much vindication. Like having lunch with your dream girl after years of thinking you could never ask her. Charles must have thought God killed the gremlin for him so he could tell _his_ people he was "the Martyr of the people."

Charles spoke clearly because he had no anxiety. He had no doubts. No questions. He was wrong, dead wrong. Pun intended. His and his peers ignorance caused so much destruction we've been studying it for centuries. Yet he still believed he was making society better. He died believing in it while speaking his last words without a hint of a stutter.

I can tell you how hard that was for him. Although I'd ~~still~~ have to jump a-around, ~~this~~ the ~~smaller~~ gremlin while I did. It's rare to be so, it's rare to be so con--fid happy, that the gremlin ~~runs~~ goes gone for good.

This story may seem dramatic. It's not. I'm using King Charles because he was among the first nobles to have the choice of leaving the throne or execution. King George III of England had the same choice in 1776 when American coloials wanted representation inside their government. King Louis XVI of France had a similar choice in 1789 and choose to stay. He ironically helped design the guiliotine that would cut his head off. Tsar Nicholas II of Russia in 1917 had a similar choice. He left the throne, but not before bringing anarchy to Tsarist Russia that brought the communists to power who soon killed him and his family.

The nobles divine right to rule was a ruling philosophy. One of many in the grand story of life's fight against evil. The political nobles were at first the protagonist, and at the end, antagonist who went down fighting, instead of bearing the shame of returing to be equals members of the community, and starting a new story. The people, were enraged, so the people rose up, and started violent revolutions.

So when you answer the question, "am I happy?", imagine yourself, and your kids, living like today, _forever_. Imagine your kids working to the sounds of DING-DING-DING-DING of whatever bell exists in so many of our workplaces trying to pretend it's still 1965. Our movies about the future, like _Blade Runner_, or _Wall-E_, show what forever without a new ruling philosophy looks like. Both are filled with advertisements selling shit for massive corporations that we recognize today because it's the continuation of our own ruling philosophy of liberal free-market economics run by obessessd ProCons, who will never change directions, until one day, we hit a ~~revolution~~ techvolution.

Remember, I'm calling bullshit on a lot. You can't say nobody told you. You can't be like Charles and stay ignorant. You can't be an extra and say I'll follow the crowd. You're reading the words that say _you_ are now responsible, because _you_ are know what has to happen.

It's okay to be selfish. You should be selfish. But you, and people like you, should also understand how your micro-story helps advanced the grand story of life on Eden. And you will, once you honestly ask the question protagonist, are - you - _happy_?

## Are You Happy

Please read this passage.

>The United States has no purpose. That is, perhaps, its greatest achievement. America’s founding document, its Declaration of Independence, allows the state to exist only to secure life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That’s it. There’s a curious lack of ambition in those words. The United States was not founded for the greater glory of anything or as the necessary outcome of history; it was founded for the freedom to collect figurines, to join a clogging troupe, to take a road trip. Yet these words, which carry no ideology whatsoever, are the ones that keep winning (against other political and economic systems, such as fascism and communism). This is the lesson of the past 10 years...The most successful organizing principle the world has ever known is a simple guarantee that we can buy and do things that have no purpose greater than the satisfaction of our own happiness.

That's from a Bloomberg BusinessWeek article in May 2011. They describe our ruling philosophy (but call it an organizing principle) of liberal free-market economics today. They use our Declaration of Independence as our political nobility used the Holy Bible. A source material to help interpet how to run a society.

Bloomberg says you're happy. Or maybe it's better to say, Bloomberg assumes your happy because they think the "simple guarantee that we can buy and do things that have no purpose greater than the satisfaction of our own happiness." should make you happy. After all, this is the grand story of society, to buy stuff _and_ eliminate poverty. It's why our ruling philosophy "keeps winning", and who wouldn't be happy with buying stuff and helping society.

You'll see our ruling philosophy in our society's institutions. Inside a _BBC_ news cast, an _The Economist_ article, a _New York Times_ op-ed piece, a _Late Night Show_ monologue, most classrooms from elementary to university, any corporate commerical, or a politcal speech from a ProCons. Each, while they'll disagree on minor details like the level of government regulations, or the best tax rates, believes our society is happy because individuals can buy and do things that make themselves happy.

The people who fill the official institutions of news, entertainment, education, business, and government are our ruling nobiilty. They infuse the ruling philosophy into our society's DNA. Many millions of people, from executives to students, bureaucrats to actors, inputting billions of daily answers into our DNA. They're happy in their roles. And although they'll notice small reasons for unhappiness, like poor job report numbers, or the high cost of college tuition, each institution thinks in the big picture, everyone in society is happy. They think this, because to them, we should all be happy.

To the ruling nobility inside our institutions happiness is the "freedom to collect figurines, to join a clogging troupe, to take a road trip". Thus, because most Westerners can get credit cards, shop on Amazon, buy a 600 horsepower car, or get an abortion, we should all be happy.

That's why today's middle class lives in the suburbs. The suburbs is the final scene of _Cinderella_ where the prince takes his princess to living happily ever after in a "dream house" with green grass yard, expansive deck, and two car garage. I'm not kidding. Early suburb housing in Leviton, was modeled after the English ruling nobility's own palaces and lifestyle that you'll see in _Downtown Abbey_.

Although the size is different, each has an elegant dinning room, trendy living room, a kitchen full of appliances, a full bedroom set per person, several huge televisions, and the basement with a pool table and bar. And of course there's flashy cars to drive whereever you want, whenever you want, in the joy someone else is envying your beautiful ride. This dream world continues with kindergarden to college education from prestigious schools, a 9-5 job with a steady paycheck, and easy shopping at a nearby superstore, or Amazon click, for all the stuff a person needs to be happy.

The idealic suburban lifestyle is the perfect manifestion of liberal free-market economics and its "simple guarantee that we can buy and do things that have no purpose greater than the satisfaction of our own happiness". Our ruling philosophy freed Cinderella, and then gave her her own banquets and balls. Success! Perpetual happiness!

If you agree. If you're happy with liberal free-market economics. If you geniunely like waking up and cutting the grass, are enthusiastic about your job, are passionate about a political party, get enough sleep, really think we're fighting climate change, enjoy shopping as a lifestyle, and think the next generation is lucky as we pass over the baton, than good! Because we haven't reached the point of revolution. And you don't need to be a protagonist like George Washington or Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

And so we still have time for techvolution. Because you shouldn't be happy.

## You Shouldn't Be Happy

I don't know you. I probably know people similar to you, so I can make guesses about you and your life. But I'll never know you, or if you're happy with our way of life. Instead, let me tell you about me, and you can compare us. I will say this. Revolutions happen when people are in agony, despair, hate. Being unhappy is less serious, but always ends up in the same place unless a change is made.

So let me tell you I'm unhappy. I've never gone hungry, always had a job, never been homeless, I'm well educated, have credit cards, and great friends. I'm born and bred middle class. But I'm still unhappy. Very unhappy in fact. And I'm right to be.

I'm unhappy because I don't think my society likes me very much. While the ruling nobility believes our way of life is so reasonable it has "no ideology whatsoever", I can't help but see a distinct philosophy by comparing their ideals with the effectual truth of living a regular middle class life. I don't think Cinderella, Rousseau, or Jefferson had our lives in mind when they fought for it centuries ago.

The reality of the average person isn't a happy one. The ideal suburban lifestyle doesn't exist. The idealized suburban lifestyle is a shame. It was born in the 1950's if your conservative; with its home-wife mom, working patriarchical father, and rascal _Leave it to Beaver_ kids. Or in the 1960's if your progressive; with its rebellous movements for female, environmental, or minority rights, hippie culture of sit ins, protests, and Woodstock music festivals.

These are minor differences, because ProCons share the suburban ideal of working parents, kids playing in the yard with their school friends, a 20 minute drive to work, and a college education to guarantee a lifetime of success. It's an ideal, one that Bloomberg and Co. acts like it still exists, but wilfully ignores when bragging about housing starts, new car sales, and or college enrollment. Someonebody has to be paying for all this materialism. And the budren of endless shopping, driving, eating, falls on the middle class.

The middle class life is a fucking circus. A daily routine of listening to childish customers whine over nothing. It's sitting through endless meetings. It's wondering when you're job is getting downsized or outsourced. It's struggling to figure out fax machines, command line interfaces, and other ancient technologies at work. It's waiting in bumper to bumper to bumper traffic for hours a day. It's having strangers for neighbors. It's executives getting bonuses while workers get paycuts. It's trying to figure out how to pay for the mortage, cars, heating, food, transportation, schooling, medicine, and insurance that keep rising to sustain an idealized way of life.

 What position did he want?  Baron, supervisor, duke, manager?  When society's ruling philosophy was be good and go to church, people did it. When it was enlist in the army and fight the Nazi's, people did it. Today people are told to consume so they do it. If anyone doesn't, they're considered weirdos, if they mess up, they're called failures, if they buy and do stuff, everyone assumes they're happy.

In reality the average middle class life is contorted, abused, and lied to in order to fulfill the happiness of others. Because while receiving happiness might be fun, providing it is not. That's why Bloomberg never mentions the joy of being a worker, employee, baker, builder, programmer, or teacher. And most people spend most of their lifes at work where the declaration of "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" means shit. Modern workers can't even be honest with customers or managers, we can't even decide what to wear, when to leave, or what tools to use, heck we can't even be sure we'll have a job tomorrow. We spend our lives bending the knee to managers and customers.

That's why I'm unhappy. Not because the Declaration of Independence is not awesome, but it was written in 1776 declaring political freedom from the oppression of a king. I don't have those problems. And interpreting our founding document to help me buy stuff is not helping me live a good life anymore. And I don't think it's helping you either.

## Natural Revolutions

I'm not crying about our lives. The middle class has much freedoms. Of course we can better oursleves, get a new job, leave a bad boss, go on a fun trip. But our unhappiness is caused by more then some sadness in our own lives. We're especially unhappy living in a society that "has no purpose." What the fuck does that mean?  How do I have a purpose if my society doesn't. No wonder anxiety, loneliness, and mental health problems are all rising.

Our poor, hungry, and cold ancestors used the Declaration of Independence for more then just enjoying banquets. Our ancestors declaring their independence was itself a higher purpose. They didn't have freedom, yet they needed it to make life better for everyone. They fought, earned, and used their freedom well. They organized into associations, governments, barn raising, unions, and businesses that since 1776 have made life on earth full of bounty. Walking down the aisles of superstores, searching the database of Amazon, and seeing so many foods, products, and services is a reality Thomas Jefferson could't even dream about when writing the Declaration of Independence.

We don't even dream about our lives anymore. Because we take our world for granted. Today the freedom from a greater purpose, and freedom from real, actual material problems, makes the average person a self-indulgent asshole reminiscent of the nobility. The worst part is we're all that asshole, kicking our neighbour whenever they're playing the role of worker to our hallowed customer who wants things like a fast good, bigger home, flashier car, and expects someone to get it for them. The sadness kicks in when the supposed happiness of indulgence wears off, and we see the horrible list of problems our society has.

Because in reality there's an ugly world behind the fascade of the perfect suburban banquet lifestyle. We have huge social problems caused by our individual indulgence. We have global warming, massive debts, and human migrations. We have a huge rise in mental illness, personal isolation, and a loss of social trust. We have terrible public faith in government, companies, and each other. We have huge houses filled with stuff that's never used. We have politics of simple bickering because many voters think their pet policy of pro/anti: guns, immigration, abortion, healthcare, taxes, environment regulation, is the most important thing in the world, because it's _their_ opinion. So important that political compromise is increasingly impossible in our society.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tEczkhfLwqM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

One of many horrible trends. We suffer from them today because they started decades ago. All the while the ruling nobility was telling everyone their ruling philosophy "keeps winning". Nevermind how easy it is to gloat when you're competiting against communism and fascism, but if our current ruling philosophy was capable of solving our societal problems, we wouldn't have them to begin with.

Instead we have endless products, from expensive university educations, to 800 horsepower cars, while our environment is being pushed to the limit to supply it, our society is in massive debt trying to sustain it, workers are bullied to build it, and we're in personal isolation trying to find the meaning of it all. We have these trends because in the end, the ruling nobility is happy telling individuals to "buy and do things that have no purpose greater than the satisfaction of our own happiness." This ruling philosophy powers the ruling nobility from the boardroom, to the checkout counter. In return the philosophy of indulgence is supposed to make individuals happy with our society.

But for the middle class forced to build, supply, and service the happinessness of others makes a life that is nasty, brutish, and short. In return we get a society full of problems to pass onto our kids.

Just like how Charlemagne and others built a world of security from the ashes of Rome's collapse, so did Jefferson and others build world of bounty from the fall of the nobilty. But unlike King Charles, I want us to realize a better world, to become a protagonist, before we're on trial talking about how great we are.

Our society has a purpose, because I have a purpose, because you have a purpose; how do we change our ruling philosophy, one that empowers real individual happiness _and_ achieves great things. Because why get we have both?

## The Digital Age Would Makes Us Happy

We can have both. Every problem we have, is because we can't see through our ruling philosophy. We follow it like it's a Holy Bible. Progressives scream at Donald Trump, conservatives belittle Bernie Sanders, silicon valley makes new personal gadgets in the millions, we keep making and buying suburbia. It's like we're stuck on repeat.

Yet, given the trend of technological development we are blaming each other for our own ignornance. In 1968 we hit a new age, the Digital Age. It's when the personal computer, and the internet were invented. These inventions were as monumental as mastering fire, forging steel, or making the telescope.

Every day since 1968, we've been fighting for, and fighting against updating our entire society's DNA to the Digital Age. The trends we suffer from, political hatred, climate change, little social capital, income inequality, massive debt, human migrations, all started and gotten worse since 1968. Look.

And that brings us back to the the ruling nobility. The ruling nobility doesn't keep liberal free-market economics around for society's benefit. They do it for their own. They occupy and are paid with money and prestige to keep the institutions of old around. Each is based on physical property like libraries, broadcasting, mass-production, and paper ballots.

The Digital Age updates all these functions because digital propery is not limited. Like printing mass books, or letting anyone see the Universe, or hold a gun, digital libraries, two-way communication, 3D printing, and instant voting should be transforming society.

Yet since 1968 we haven't changed much. We've kept using conservatism, progressivism, and their shared philosophy of liberal free-market economics. Thankfully, some of our society has adapted to the Digital Age. We'll take a look now. It'll be a hint into the future of techvolution.
