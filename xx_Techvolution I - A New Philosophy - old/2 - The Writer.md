# CHAPTER SIX - THE WRITER

## The Writer

Life is a grand story of life about thwarting death. Technology helps expand the tools to win that eternal fight against good and evil, life and death. Life gets technology by the actions of its lifeforms inside their own microstories. Each lifeform is the protagonist of their own story. And that's why they always see themselves as Luke Skywalker, and their enemy as Darth Vader. Individuals are combined by a ruling philosophy, that guides as a shared consciousness to help make and distribute new technology.

At first the ruling philosophy helps grow new technology, like castles to protect Western Europeans from raiding barbarians, and factories to manufacture products to conquer poverty. Supporting these ruling phiosophies grow and distribute new technology makes individuals protagonists in the grand story of life. However, since we don't master our own philosophies, "Skywalker" kings and executives, become "Vader" kings and executives, as they resist the empowerment of the population via the distribution of technology.

Having new technology, with a ruling philosophy and nobility that is out of date, causes the future go through a revolution. A massive burst of frustration, that society is so out of step with the possibilities of modern technology. The printing press made the peasant population of Western Europe educated yet still officially powerless in a pre-revolution America or France. The internet and computer, made consumers powerful, yet told they're were thieves for using modern technology. The average person's happiness is a good bellweather on how well society's ruling philosophy is in step with the possibilities of modern technology. All because the official "rules" of society, like with Frederick Douglass, were out of step.

If we're going to master story, but proactively changing to its twists and turns via techvolution, we have should understand how life writes the story, with the props, emotions, dialogue, motivations, characters, and plot. This is how life, or whatever brought life into this Universe, and kickstarted the great battle between life and death, or said another way, good and evil, is the story of life.

## The Psyscope

Isn't all this wonderful Mister Majic. We should take control of our ruling philosophy. If that was easy, then it wouldn't be called a ruling philosophy. How do we tell kings and queens what do to. How can we decide to live a life of techvolution? Darth Vader hides very well.

It comes down to stories. Your microstory will always be a struggle. Because a good microstory is dealing with problems, and overcoming problems is always a struggle. But overcoming problems is a life worth living, because that's what life, rewards with more life.

So I hope you like exacting detail. Here's how to see and understand stories in great detail. Because after this chapter you'll understand stories, especially movies.

By understanding stories, microstories and grandstories, we'll going to be making a telescope for the human psyche. Because now you're the topic of science, and we don't understand ourselves very well. We only understand what we can sense. So we understand our skin color, or our height and weight. But our lives aren't decided by our appearance. And as digital products keep telling us more details, like our sleep regiments, our motivation, we'll be getting a clearer picture of our true selves. And to understand that picture, we need to understand our stories.

With that picture, we'll working to making a real life version of the _Civilization_ game. Where we understand the purpose of our grandstory, and our microstories, because we'll be able to sense it, and by make sense of it.

    First, I need to explain some basics of good cinematic storytelling. A movie is based on a plot that features a protagonist trying to solve a problem through a series of events, and an antagonist who wants to keep things the same. So, Cinderella wants to go to the ball and her evil step-family doesn’t want her to. Both main characters and their supporters fight over the problem until the conclusion, where we find out which side will win. Will the glass slipper fit Cinderella or an evil step-sister? Oh the drama, because whoever has the perfect fit, gets to marry the prince!

    In good storytelling, be it fairy tale, romance, or comedy, the sequence of events must be unexpected enough to be interesting, yet logical enough to be believable. Balancing the two is the art of good storytelling.

## The Nature of Storytelling

Good stories, whether inside a book, epic poem, play, movie, speech, or real life, control how we act and think. Because good stories are unexpected enough to be interesting, yet logical enough to be believable. This opens our minds, and makes us wonder. And with wonder comes new ideas. Aristotle masterfully dissected stories in _Poetics_ over 2300 years ago. Stories are so ingrained in our nature we can still use it as our guide.

A story is a character addressing a problem through a series of events. The events are organized in three parts. The first is the introduction of the protagonist who realizes a problem she wants to solve, and the antagonist who wants to keep things the same. The second part is where both characters and their supporters fight over the problem. The third part is the conclusion, where we find out which side will win. Both the characters and the viewers enjoy, or dread, the drama of not knowing which side will win. The goal and art of storytellng is making the audience always wonder that's going to happen next.

![Cinderella's Story](/img\ch6\story-cinderella.png)
_In_ Cinderella _the forces of good organize to defeat the forces of her evil step-family. A classic rags to riches tale._

Good storytelling makes us wonder by telling a surprising, yet rational, story. Believability in turn allows the audience to invest their emotions. That's why a well-told story makes us feel surprised, intrigued, mad, disgusted, joyous, and so on. Look at the faces of people during a good movie and you'll see how transfixed they are. It's because the movie is very believable and the audience is wondering what's going to happen next. Wondering what's going to happen next makes the audience open to many possibilities in the story.

Wonder does the same thing in real life. It also opens our minds because we don't blindly follow our own impulses, or the ruling philosophy. Wonder is the fuel to techvolution. So what makes us wonder, is asking what empowers techvolution. Let's find wonder.

## Story Parts

To understand something, we must tear it apart. According to Aristotle, stories have seven elements as the characters fight over the problem in a series of events. They're listed below, last to first in importance.

**Items** are the visual apparatus,the props, of the story. Broom sticks, magic hats, shoes, clothes, houses. Sleds, cars, animals, custumes; any material thing whether special effects or real, are items. Put them all together and items make the setting, like ancient Rome, galactic space, as suburb, or the ever-changing Eden.

Although items are how we interface with the world, they are the least important in storytelling. Items have no life until a story gives them purpose. Movies with great special effects, can still be bad. Stage plays, and novels put little thought into their items, because few people experience stories for the items.

And in most stories, most the time, most people are items. We call people-items extras. In computer games, they're called "non-playing character". Still individuals, yet they have no direct role to play in overcoming, or defending, the stories problem, and thus are items.

Sucks to hear but anyone stuck inside a cubicle knows what I'm talking about. Think stormtroopers in _Star Wars_, or the people stuck inside the _The Matrix_, or the French villagers in _Beauty and the Beast_. Items, whether props or people in a story only get meaning when someone has gifts them passion. Thereafter they start to come alive.

**Passions**. Passions often shows itself with music. A way to tell the audience what's important inside the story. Try listening to _The Lord of the Rings_ when Gandalf dies, and you'll hear sadness. Or think _Jaws's_ score and how generations of people wouldn't get into a pool if they heard the two tones of a tuba. Music makes the audience sympathize with the passions of the story.

Passions live beyond music. Items come alive when somebody cares about them. Passion is the difference fast-food, and a buger made by a chef. There's a huge difference between a candy bar wrapper, and the candy bar wrapper your crush used to pranked you with. One is discarded, and another is a cherished memento because the items was touched by story. Think Cinderella’s slipper, or Little Red Riding Hood's basket, or Andy in _Toy Story_ hoping he's played with. To be used, and loved, gives toys life. Items with some passion get involved in the stories problem. Like lightsabres in the Jedi vs Sith struggle of _Star Wars_.

This happens in real life too. How important is the American flag waving overtop Philadelphia, or the wedding ring on your figure, or the Nobel prize so many scientists dream about? Just items, until someone cares about them. Passions can be good and bad, but passions still live inside them.

People need real life items to enliven their hobbies and interests. Things like a guitar to a guitarist, a gun to a soldier, a stove to a baker, or a Wikipedia edit to a educator. Each's persons passion is made real with items. As a person's passion is actualized with items, that person also becomes less of an extra and more of a character. Gift a person their passion, let them practice and master their passion, and you gave them life. Deny them their passion, and you've taken life away. Characters with passion, promote and defend their passions in their dialogue.

**Dialogue** is the powerful words, whether written of spoken, between characters fighting for their passions, as they fight over the stories problem. Dialogue is how characters communicate, like Hugh telling Sophia teaching a slave to read is bad. Or when Darth Vader wanted the secret plans to the Death Star back, he demanded them in dialogue. When captured rebel fighters resisted him, they lied in dialogue. When beleaguered rebel comrades needed to uplift each other, they'd say "May the Force be with you" in dialogue. Dialogue creates the official rules of the story. Read this from _Star Wars_:

INT: SPACE SHIP - DAY

Darth Vader stands with several STORMTROOPERS and REBEL FIGHTERS, inside a space ship's battle torn hallway. Vader wants secret plans to the Death Star the rebels just stole, and the rebels aren't cooperating.

STORMTROOPER
(talking to Vader)
The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.

DARTH VADER  
(lifting rebel fighter, choking him)  
Where are those transmissions you intercepted? What have you done with those plans?

REBEL FIGHTER
(choking, lying)  
We intercepted no transmissions. This is a consular ship. We're on a diplomatic mission.

DARTH VADER  
(strangling him)  
If this is a consular ship, where is the ambassador! Commander, tear this ship part until you've found those plans, and bring me the passengers! I want them alive!

The Stormtroopers scatter, the other Rebel fighters look at their comradres lifeless body. Vader looks at the next one, who closes his mouth.

END SCENE

Darth Vader and the Rebel Fighter were really passionate about those plans because those plans were the problem of the movie. Both fought for their passion in dialogue. A person isn't a character until they promote or defend their passion with dialogue.

In real life dialogue is authority, the line between thinking and acting as we live our microstories. Try to get something without dialogue. Stutterers and mutes will know the difficulty. For others think of being lost in a foriegn city. Better yet, think of all the words you can't say in your life. Kindergarten to university, work place to first date, has unspeakable words. Not physically unspeakable of course. Socially unspeakable. Because once you say a word it's officially dialogue.

You look smokin, can we skip the dinner!
You're my boss, you're an idiot!
I cheated on my exams!

All examples of shit you can think, even act open, but can not say. Because dialogue influences people. Therefore it is regulated. When tyrants come, they start by controlling society's dialogue. When they fall, dialogue starts the rebellion. Rousseau was a penniless drifter, yet his calls for equality were so powerful, he was considered dangerous. Because he wrote good dialogue.

Authority figures like lawyers, policeman, professors and politicians use dialogue every day. Dialogue is laws and regulations, customs and conventions. Dialogue makes the rules we fight over. Once a rule is created in dialogue, it dictates the passions of the people inside.

Can Luke Skywalker learn the Force in time? Can Darth Vader extract the truth about the plans? Can Romeo serenade Juliette? All these passions are fought over with dialogue. Likewise, in the real world. Should music have copyright, or copyleft? Should you confont the bully? Should unpaid overtime be tolerated, or exposed by a newspaper article? Dialogue takes a stand and promotes and defends character's passions. But dialogue alone can't win or lose the fight over the story's problem. For that, stories need main characters.

**Antagonist** is a main character. More than just using dialogie, main characters fight for their passions with actions. We've already seen why Darth Vader is a memorable antagonist. He chokes, chases, slices, and lots of other stuff to get the Death Star plans back. Cinderella's step-mother is also an antagonist because she oppresses her step-daughter in dialogue and in actions.

Antagonist are the defenders of the stories problem. Because the antagonist fought to create the way the world is in the first place. Antagonists actually don't see any problems with the story's problem. For example, Darth Vader wanted the Death Star plans back because helped build the super-weapon and wanted to use it, not destroy it. A story's Antagonist is the victorious Protagonist of a prior story; thus, he doesn't want anyone else to change his hard fought reality. The reality the antagonist wants to preserve in _Star Wars_ is the Death Star's intimidation over the galaxy, or in _The Lord of the Rings_ the One Ring's power over men, or in _Cinderella_ Cinderella's servitude to her step-family.

In real life, Antagonists are those who defend the status quo. People like King Charles I, Louis XVI defending the nobles divine right to rule, or the movie executive defending DVD's. However, antagonists are only antagonists relative to the problem of the story. So maybe King Charles wasn't a antagonist about changing England's dietary tradition. Or maybe the movie executive promoted electric cars. Antagonists are not a title, or nameplace, but are known by their actions.

Antagonists have all the capabilities of the protagonist. They can use items, passions, dialogue, and actions to fight for what they want. They often have extras, and supporting characters to help them like step-daughters, henchman or stormtroopers. What they can't do is rise above the stories problem to get what they want. Because antagonists are the protectors of the story's problem and therefore are bound by its thought.

**Thought** is deep passions and motives of the story and its characters. Thought defends the supposed problem of the story with ordered dialogue. Think the of the hatred between the Capulet and Montague's in _Romeo and Juliet_. Or the eternal struggle of Jedi's Light Side and Sith's Dark Side of The Force in _Star Wars_. Thought isn't created via dialogue, but assumed to already exist and confirmed in a story's characters, dialogue, passions, and items.

A story's thought motivates its characters. Because their families hated each other, Romeo and Juliette's love is so much stronger. Dark Vader hunts the Death Star plans because he needs the Dark Side to win over the Light Side. A storie extra charactes, like Imperial Stormtroopers or Rebel Fighters don't think before they fight. They are passionate props controlled by the story's thought, so they're automatically enemies, and thus just start shooting when they see each other. Thought is like the matrix in _The Matrix_; a container for items, passions, and dialogue to live inside.

In real life, thought means a lot. It's the ruling philosopy of a story. Thought defends the society put in place to solve a particular problem, like politicla anarcy after Rome's collapse. Thought motivates entire peoples inside their civilization. This is sometimes called the Noble Lie. A supposed lie that everyone agrees on, making it true. The shared consciousness of the Leviathan, inside "the nobles divine right to rule", it thought.

Thought is human made. Inside this cave is the reality most people live inside. This his how the Leviathan of the people, acts together to solve problems. To dismantle thought can take revolutions. Techvolution require us to master our society's thought. Thought is so powerful it controls anyone not a protagonist.

**Protagonist** is the other main character. Protagonists are the standouts, the special ones, the risktakers, the rebels, the troublemakers. Protagonists have the same items as everyone else, but fill them with different passions because protagonists see a new problem they want to solve. Society's existing passions, dialogue and thought are thus wrong and need to change.

Protagonists are different because of _Realization_; the ability to see a problem, and the new reality needed to solve it. Think of Luke Skywalker learning to use the Force to destroy the Death Star, Juliette realizing a family fued shouldn't get in the way of love, or Neo learning how to control _The Matrix_. Protagonists take control of a story's passions, dialogue, and thought because their Realization means they use each to solve a new problem

Protagonists control others persons because their reality, the proposed new thought to solve a problem, is unseen to everyone else. That's why the protagonist is the story's leader; showing others the way to his better thought. The protagonist fights to replace the thought realized and defended by the antagonist.

A microstory's items, passions, dialogue, and thoughts are good or bad relative to the realization of the protagonist. We see the antagonist supporters like Stormtroopers in _Star Wars_ or the French villagers in the _Beauty and the Beast_ as thoughtless followers because they don't understand the new truth behind the realization of the protagonist, i.e. the Jedi are better, or the Beast is a really nice guy. The protagonist’s followers are in the know.

Imagine if _Star Wars_ showed the families of the "bad guys" on the Death Star that Luke Skywalker blows up. Millions of families were devastated, yet the audience celebrates because a few thousand rebel "good guys" were saved. In _Star Wars_ the rebel forces are freedom fighters! The protagonist’s forces do not know exactly what they're fighting for. But they believe in the protagonist’s vision and fight to make it a reality. To us they're the good guys.

In real life Protagonists are the giants of history. People who addressed society's problems. Scientists like Friar Bruno, Copernicus, Galileo, Darwin, or Einstein. Philosophers like Socrates, Aristotle, and Machiavelli. Innovators like Lovelace, Hopper, and Gates. Brave rebels like Perpetua, Douglass, and Parks. These people are history's protagonists because they rebelled against the thought of their day and solved a problem. Anyone can be a main character if they answer to a higher power than human created thought and solve a unsolved problem. Just seeing a problem isn't enough, a protagonist must fight for it.

Anyone can be a protagonist. Anyone can change history by solving a unsolved problem. Think of a friend who's honest about a problem you're having, the stranger who stands up to a bully, or when you finally tell Juliette how you feel. A protagonist realizes a solution, must make it real and someone is trying to stop them. Protagonists are the hero of their own, and our, story.

**Plot** is the the most important storytelling element. Plot is the series of events between protagonist and antagonist as they fight over the problem. The best plots have a change of fortune for the protagonist from bad to good, or vice versa. Incidents should be logical and follow naturally from the actions that precede them. The audience will like the incidents more if they come as a surprise, however, the audience must see them as plausible, even necessary. A good plot is both surprising and inevitable.

Key incidents in the plot are the Reversal of Situation, the Suffering of the Protagonist and most importantly Realizations. Reversals surprisingly, but logically, change the circumstances of the characters. Think in _Star Wars_ when the Death Star catches the Millennium Falcon and the Death Stars secret plans, or when Cinderella meets her fairy godmother

Suffering of the Protagonist happens when the Protagonist lives with the stories problem and no change seems forthcoming. Like Cinderella thinking she'll never met meet her prince again, or Belle living in the Beast's castle.

Realizations are revelations. Times when the protagonist and the audience realizes something new. Neo learning to master the Matrix, Luke Skywalker mastering The Force, or Cinderella fitting into the glass slipper. Realizations can be against the Protagonist as well, like when Darth Vader tells Luke "I am your Father" in the _Empire Strikes Back_. Realizations are moments of creation. When the story creates a new reality.

Making new realities, is after all the magic of good storytelling. In the end, a story is the protagonist, wanting to solve a problem, and wanting to change society's thought to make it happen. The antagonist is the status quo's defender. The antagonist had previously won his own story, came up with his own solution to a problem, and he wants to keep everything the same. Dialogue, passions and items are all tools protagonist and antagonist use, as the two go through a series of events in an introduction, middle, and conclusion. The audience watches because we wonder what's going to happen next in a reality we believe in.

## APPLICATIONS

So, every fictious and real story has the storytelling elements listed above. Whenever we're overcoming a problem, we live inside these elements. To appreciate how effective this system is at understanding our reality, realize that can archealogists find a few pots, arrow heads, and manuscript, and can beging to understand an ancient civilization, because every item, is a reflection of the story it comes from. In fiction and real life, you can use these features to look deeper into any item, passion, rule, person, thought, and event.

Let's practice a couple.

![The Matrix](img\ch6\triangle-the-matrix.png)
**The Matrix:**  The perfect example for us. The story is about machines that enslave humanity, and keep us inside a virtual prison called The Matrix.  The real world is a dystopia, were people are power generators for the machines. The items of the story are 1999 western society, and a dystopia setting. The passions are human emotions empowering individuals against slavery. Dialogue is very human vs machine. The antagonist machine leader wants to preserve the slaver. The thought is to keep people in slavery for their own, and machines, good. The protagonist Neo slowly realizes ways to master The Matrix's thought and overpowers the ignorant antagonists. The plot is about cutting the cord that lets the machines control human prisoners.

![Star War](img\ch6\triangle-star-wars.png)
**Star Wars:** An entire galaxy is controlled by a evil Empire. Evildoers keep control with their superweapon Death Star. Meagre resistance fighters stole its schematics and might find a weakness. The items are space ships, and alien planets. Passions are forces bewteen the Light and Dark Sides. Dialogue reinforces the do or die battle. The antagonist is Darth Vader who needs to save the Death Star to keep the Dark Side on top of the eternal thought battle between Light and Dark Sides. The protagonist Luke slowly realizes how to master the Light Side and become strong enough to defeat Darth Vader. The plot concludes when Luke shoots a missle and destroys the Death Star.

![Argh](img\ch6\triangle-office-space.png)
**Office Space:**  This is a story about modern life. Items is everything from a condo, to car, to a cubicle. Passions are the desire for a better, more interesting life. Dialogue is the passive aggressive rules of doing what your boss says, regardless of how stupid it is. The antagonist is the boss who grinds his employess. Thought is the drive for profits of corporations who the boss services. The protagonist is the guy who says fuck it, I can't stand this bullshit. And the plot, is finding a way out.

![Baking](img\ch6\triangle-baking.png)
**Baking:**  Let's do an example from everyday life. Say baking a cake. First the items are just everything around your house. Furniture, kids, television, books, kitchen, bedroom, everything. The passion is the challenge of making a good cake, and the reward of sharing your cake. Dialogue is the rules to baking, and the internal dialogue about succeeding, or failing. The antagonist is your own laziness because it's so much easier to order a cake and watch a cooking show. The thought is consumerism, which says its okay to never bake anymore. But your grandmother always baked from scratch, can you do better? Probably not, but you'll try anyway. The protagonist is you, the person determined to spend hours making a cake despite all the reasons not to. And the plot is the cake. Filled with all the items, passions, recipes, antagonist, thoughts, and your skills. It's a wonderful story you can enjoy with your friends and family.

## THE HIGHER PURPOSE

These are how stories work. So how does life, God, or whoever writes our stories use these elements. How does it look like. This is important, because we're going to use Aristotle's storytelling elements to understand our ruling philosophy, and the technological development that inevitably discredits it. We'll map our revolutions, so we can predict them to start techvolution.

Here's a legend.

![Legend](img\ch6\story-legend.png)

  **Possibilties** - Everything that could happen. Like looking at the Universe, your imagination is the limit. The closer a possibility is to reality, it jumps from being obvious, to reasonable, to surprising, to irrational, to genius.
  
  **Old Reality** - The reality before the story starts.
  
  **Beginning** - When the protagonist breaks from reality.
  
  **Protagonist ideas** - The possibilities available within the protagonists character of being brave, idealistic, or foolhardy.
  
  **Antagonist ideas** - The possibilities available within the antagonists character of being determined, witty, or desperate.
  
  **Realizations** -  Moments when a character sees a new reality.
  
  **Plot** - The collection of possiblities made real by characters actions. Plot is the ecosystem for all other Aristotle's elements to interact.
  
  **Suffering of the Protagonist** - Long periods when the protagonists suffers.
  
  **Reversal of Situations** - Short periods where the plot changes big time.
  
  **Free will / Personalities** - The area between plot and character, where the person can decide how to respond to plot events.
  
  **Conclusion** - Convergence of plot and character to decide the result of the story.
  
  **New Reality** - The result of the battle between protagonist and antagonist. Regardless who wins, they effected each other, and the new reality will be different.

This is the how story's look like. So any micro story, and grand story, we've lived, or will live, we can map this way. And we'll do that shortly. First we have to see the three difference kinds of stories we'll encounter.

## Three Kings of Stories

There are three kinds of stories. One that works, and two that don't for different reasons. This will help us see the trends history, and our rising, and failing ruling philosophies. We also need to know, how does a story start, and how does it end, to beable to predict our futures with .

![Functional Story](img\ch6\functional-story-example-star-wars.png)
*Functional:* Aristotle's story elements are well ordered. The story is about an explicit problem. The protagonist wants to change something, and the antagonist doesn't. Both have strong wills and either might win. Both have distinct passions and thoughts that bind them, making them a believable person. As protagonist and antagonist battle, they make a logical yet surprising plot. Protagonist experiences reversal of situations, suffering, and realizations.

The plot moves quickly. All characters are forced to act because their goal is in jeopardy. The events of the plot continually challenge the character to make decisions, decisions which reveal the character of the character. That is why the separation between plot and character is healthy. Giving room for characters to choose, yet forcing them to make a choice. No one knows the conclusion; who will win, and if the problem will be overcome or not. However since the reality is questioned by the protagonist, it will change in some way. The new reality is a mixture of progtagonist and antagonist thoughts. Because it's a functional story the audience cares about the story and its characters. Ex. Cinderella, Shawshank Redemption, Star Wars, Pixar, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, etc.

![Art Story](img\ch6\story-art.png)
**Art:** Aristotle's story elements are disordered. Character personalites take the place of plot and control all other elements. The story doesn't have an explicit problem. Thus, the protagonist and antagonist are not defined and sometimes don't even exist. Since there is no battle between protagonist and antagonist, the plot is often illogical and inconsequential. There are fewer reversal of situations, suffering of the protagonist, and realizations.

Art stories emphasize character's passions. Art stories are less stories than personal diaries as a character discovers their loves, likes, hobbies, and interests. Since little is at risk, there is a weak problem, a weak protagonist and a weak antagonist. The separation between plot and character is wide. A weak plot means character's make choices by their personalities. Since the plot isn't about a problem, it can't be anticipated. There is little audience investment unless a viewer has the same passion as the characters like "youth angst". If the audience is outside the social group, the story is arbitrary, and so you don't feel anything for its plot, characters, thoughts, dialogue and passions. The conclusion doesn't change the original reality very much. Art stories do not survive the test of history. They do not pass into archetype status. Ex. "The Cinema", Snow Angels, Wrecked, Spanglish, many Sundance, and TIFF films, etc.

![Spectacle Story](img\ch6\story-spectacle.png)
**Spectacle:** Aristotle's story elements are disordered. The story is about an obvious problem like the world is ending, or a big bomb will explode. Protagonist and antagonist fight over the problem, but since the problem is blatant, the plot is direct. There is no room for characters to choose their next steps. Character actions are instinctual because everyone runs from an explosion,  or a horror villian, or running from an even bigger explosion!

Spectacle stories emphasize items and effects. The story is about how the protagonist wins, not if. The audience isn't engaged with reversal of situations, suffering of the protagonist, and realizations. Thus, the plot, characters, dialogue and passions are not memorable. The plot is very logical but never surprising. The separation of plot and character is small because most people would respond the same to survival situations. Since the plot can't be surprising, its conclusion is logical and never in doubt. Strict spectacle stories are meaningless. They do not survive the test of history. Ex. Transformers 1-8, Star Wars 1-3 / 7-9, most sequels and remakes.

![Story Conclusion](img\ch6\story-conclusion.png)
**Beginning and Conclusion:** The beginning is where we find out what the problem is and who will fight over it. We also find out what the old reality is. We get an idea on the reality the protagonist wants to replace it with. In _Cinderella_ we find out she is mistreated and wants to better herself. In the beginning the protagonist decides to act, and starts to grow supporters to their cause. The antagonist also grows their supporter base.

Art stories don't have a real beginning. Since they aren't about a specific problem they could start at any moment. Spectacle stories have a beginning but are about fighting for survival and not fighting for a new reality. Only functional stories have real beginnings. Because functional stories have a protagonist fighting to replace a reality with their own.

Likewise, only functional stories have conclusions. Conclusions require mixing two proposed realities and making a new one. Conclusions are also where plot and character share importance. Because at the conclusion the characters actions are so important, they directly affect the plot.

Conclusions are where characters control history. Will Frodo drop the One Ring into the Mount Doom or not? Will Luke join his father in the Dark Side of the Force? Will Belel kiss the Beast and end the curse? All functional stories make us all _wonder_ what will happen next at the story's climax. Conclusions do this because they questioned a reality we believe in. We find out the effectual truth in the story's conclusion. When characters choices are so powerful, they control the plot.

Because functional stories make us wonder, and because their conclusion makes a new reality, it's with functional stories we enjoy the magic of creation. We enjoy a possibility being pulled down from the infinite Universe and made real inside our stories.

![After the story ends](img\ch6\distribution-star_wars.png)
_Fun time is over. When a functional story ends, everything is effected by the new realtiy, but is no longer ordered inside Aristotle's story elements. Until a new story comes along to give them a purpose again. The triangle will look different when it reforms._

What happens after conclusions. All story elements, all characters, all items and thoughts, return to being mere possibilities. The plot that bound them is over, and thus each returns to being an equal. Waiting for a new story to give them life and purpose.

For example, in _Star Wars_ Once the Death Star is blown up, Luke is no longer the protagonist, Vader isn't the antagonist, Light Side defeated the Dark side, dialogue isn't controlled by the need to destroy/save the Death Star, passions can follow something else, and items are just things again. The hierarchy becomes a circle. The need for growth is over. Everyone can enjoy the the period of equality again.

Importantly, since spectacle and art stories don't have stories, they can't have conclusions. So they continue growing indefinitely. Thus art is followed with more art, and spectacle is followed with more spectacle. Nothing new is created in this cycle.

![One of three ways](img\ch6\story-conclusion-functional-art-spectacle.png)

Art and spectacle stories disorder Aristotle's elements. Because they are increasingly non-functioning they have to escalate their art or spectacle to retain interest. The escalate slowly with more special effects in spectacle, or more eccentric characters in art. Soon, more effects becomes effects laden stories and gore porn, while art character become so eccentric only insiders can find a rationale for the existence.
