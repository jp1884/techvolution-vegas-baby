## Giving You a Map and Compass

In 1945, a technical genius predicted the world we live in today. Before anyone sent an email or browsed Wikipedia, Vannevar Bush thought it up. He was fighting World War II, and dreamed computer technology would cure the human condition.

Technologists were inspired. Soon they were creating transistors, mainframes, and taking pictures of Earth from the moon. As technology got smaller and cheaper in the 1970s, computers and the internet started to spread throughout the planet.

Yet, many indicators of human and biological quality of life got worse. The sixth mass extinction is underway, government debt is at historic highs, individuals are facing declining wealth, increased isolation, and rising debt, and political partisanship has become the norm.

Evidently computer technology did not cure anything. 

But it has. Cancer, bacteria, hunger, and so many more pains are lower now then every before because of modern technology.

Our problem is us.

Technology changed and we did not. We are suffering for the same reason any lifeform does. Evolution is our job and we are not doing it. To improve our future, we must change, our identity, ideologies, and economics. A task so large we require a new paradigm, without it we risk becoming fossils.

Wild to thing about?

People used to think some wild things. The world was flat, the Earth was the center of the universe, disease was caused by bad air. Each of these beliefs was absolute—until some resisted accepted wisdom hard enough to uncover new truths that revealed the difference between wild and fact.

Our wild idea is the latter.

Because you, me, and most everyone else in the world are unconsciously using biological instincts to survive inside an ever advancing technological ecosystem. And it is this mismatch between our instincts and our environment that causes our fights over identities, political gridlock, and economic malaise.

The journey to adopt a new paradigm starts by accepting the power of universal laws.

Universal laws are our best guide because they are eternal. Just think how light travels the same way now as it did 10 billion years ago. This timelessness applies to physics, chemistry, and biology. Meaning life, wherever it takes hold, always plays the same Darwinian game of evolution.

We named the game after Charles Darwin because he decoded much of its rules. He showed how all lifeforms instinctively play a grand competition, striving to survive and reproduce to pass on their genetics. As each generation exhibits slight variations, natural selection favors traits that enhance survival and reproductive success, driving the evolution of new species better suited to the changing environment.

Of course, we know these rules of evolution apply to our biology, but our current paradigm does not let us see these same laws apply to human civilization—and all the technologies that create, build, and power it, and by extension educate, house, and feed us.

That's why this book is about you rejecting conventional wisdom and embracing a new paradigm: that human life is now primarily technological, and technological life is Darwinian.

As past realizations about new truths allowed us to solve problems with space satellites and medicines, the benefits to embracing this natural law today are equally immense. 

Let me explain.

Right now many in Gen Z are hoping to buy a car and own a home. Scores of retirees are hoping they will have the healthcare they need to live comfortable retirements. Workers need more money, bosses need better workers. Conservatives worry about traditional values in a changing world, while Progressives exhaust themselves defending social changes. Technologists are bored using the technology of the future to make the toys of today. Wise people are worrying when our many debt bubbles might burst.

There is a long list of people in need and seeking answers. There are countless talking points on social media vying for our attention. If this massive amount of political content had answers, they would have been found by now. 

Well-meaning influencers and analysts cannot find solutions, because in truth, each is rooted in a old paradigm that does not account for the technological ecosystem we live in. Hence, they apply biological identities such as race, gender, and ethnicity, to technological problems.

To overcome our challenges requires us to uncover natural laws and finally adopt a world view that sees what modern human life truly is.

Just another chapter in the ongoing game of evolution—but with a twist, evolution is now technological. This change is nothing but a difference in material, one among the many that has taken place during the eons, epochs, ages in which Earth has had different geologies, atmospheres, environments, and lifeforms.

That means life has been where you are today many times before. It should not be a surprise there is a time-tested game plan for not only your survival, but prosperity.

And that is the evolution of new species better suited to win the game.

We already have the technology. Thus, you can only harness this winning playbook, once you realize we must evolve new ways of life to reap the benefits of new technology.

We have not been doing that. 

As mentioned, in 1970, the foundational technologies of the next age—microchips, computers, and internet—were converging; the Internet Age was born. It was not long until amazing new digital products filled the world like so many offspring seeking to win their place on the field. Sadly, some did not embrace its inventions, hoping to unnaturally keep their own alive. Happily, progress was not stopped and a new age kept evolving.

However, continued advancements are never assured. We are seriously holding back the Internet Age by using biological identities and ideological beliefs to select which modern technologies and adaptations live or die.

_Techvolution On the Origin of Technological Species_ will make the selection of technological species more natural. By empowering you, whether someone in Gen Z hoping to start a family or a retiree hoping to have grandkids, to do what life has done many times before: leave the shadows of a bygone age behind and purposefully evolve to the new environment in which you live.

Realizing the Earth was not the center of the Universe launched the Science Age. Likewise, by realizing Earth is a lifeboat with time only for evolutionary winners, means we humans must embrace our technological evolution. Only then can we quickly unmask many new ideas and practical solutions of the Internet Age to improve our lives.

The journey will transformative. We will uncover our technological identity, empower you to make smarter tool choices, and learn to stop merely surviving Industrial Age obsolescence. With these lessons, you can select yourself to flourish in the Internet Age and thereby improve the fortunes of all who will follow us.

## Illustration

Earth is not a planet it is a lifeboat, and life only wants people who can keep the game alive. This illustration represents Earth's geological time periods and the lifeforms that lived within them, which we understand very well.

This illustration applies the Darwinian principles to civilization, so we can understand the evolution of technological life.

## Book Series

Techvolution: On the Origin of Technological Species presents a new way of understanding human civilization. It showcases how the human story is driven not by our beliefs or ideologies, but by the technologies we create and use. The journey from recognizing our technological nature to building a better world happens in three stages, each transforming a fundamental realm of human experience: individual identity, political discourse, and economic systems.

The journey from recognizing our technological nature to building a better world happens in three stages:

**Book I—A New Identity:** This foundational work introduces a "technological identity"—the idea that we humans are best understood through the tools and technologies we use to house ourselves, earn a living, and in general, interact with the world. While we have names for our nationality, ethnicity, employment, and politics, we lack consciousness of our technological nature.

Consider someone labeled "Californian, female, Hispanic, college graduate, progressive, regional manager"—yet none of these captures what matters most to her: it is 2011, high-speed internet is finally widespread, and she sells DVDs for a living. Because technological evolution is about to make physical media discs obsolete, her personal networks and knowledge base are now of questionable value. Yet, we have no name for this identity that might upend her life. This is but one example of why, from power tools to smartphones, our technological choices not only shape what we can do but who we should see in the mirror so we stop using biological instincts to live in a technological ecosystem.

**Book II—Mixed Ideological Politics:** Having established our technological identity, we must next liberate our toolsets from ideological constraints. Today, we often reject useful tools simply because of their political or cultural associations—renewable energy is labeled "green," diesel trucks "red-blooded American." These artificial divisions prevent us from combining technologies in optimal ways.

Mixed Ideological Politics teaches how to evaluate tools based purely on their effectiveness in solving our real-life problems, from the cost of home heating to increased storm activity. This new political philosophy prevents any ideology from blinding us to any worthy technology. In essence, this book is about learning political moderation in the modern age.

**Book III—Bumblebee Economics:** Once we combine technological self-awareness with ideology-free tool selection, we can create an economy as adaptive as life itself. Nature shows us the way. Her diverse biological species create collaborative ecosystems through simple rules of interaction. Bumblebee Economics applies this wisdom to our technological world. While we have already developed some open-source and interoperable technologies like USB and Bluetooth, we need an economic philosophy that accelerates their use to create a freely evolving technological ecosystem.

The goal is to create an ecosystem similar to Apple's, but more decentralized and dynamic: imagine medical records seamlessly flowing between a doctor's office, pharmacy, and your smartphone. All this via independent, yet standardized, programs that can evolve independently. Like bees and flowers co-evolving in a symbiotic relationship, this framework would enable technologies to adapt and grow, with users benefiting from increasingly capable and interconnected systems. With this approach, we can finally move on from the Industrial Age's mass-production mindset and embrace the era of mass collaboration in the Internet Age.

`Understand yourself → Learn to use different tools → Work effectively with others`

## About the Author

This book attempts a leap in human understanding. That is quite a bold task; I am not sure what qualifies anyone to undertake it. I have a quality formal education and have worked in various industries, which helps provide the means to think differently. I tried very hard (and it turns out quite foolishly) to get scientific data to showcase techvolution. As you will learn, it turns out being thwarted in that task revealed more truths than the evidence would have.

As a kid in a grocery store, two friends were fighting over which cake to buy. Unable to participate for reasons you will soon learn about, I resolved to fix the tiresome bickering. So, I listened to both sides; one wanted chocolate the other vanilla. I left unnoticed and returned with a marbled cake. Both fell silent, and we soon enjoyed the taste of compromise as happy friends. It is a mentality I had and honed while looking out into our society, researching, and writing this book.
