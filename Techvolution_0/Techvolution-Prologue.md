## Giving You a Map and Compass

People used to think some wild things. The world was flat, the Earth was the center of the universe, disease was caused by bad air. Each of these beliefs was absolute—until, some resisted the power of accepted wisdom hard enough to redefine truth.

It should make you wonder, what dark things do we believe, and what hidden truths are they masking? This book exposes a big one that explains much of our current problems.

You, me, and most everyone else in the world are unconsciously using biological instincts to survive inside a technological ecosystem. And this mismatch between our actions and our environment is the cause of our confused identities, political strife, and economic malaise.

The evidence for this dysfunction is shown in our daily experiences, where civil society is unable to agree—from election results to trade deals—on much of anything anymore.

Our salvation is what it has always been; uncovering natural laws that dislodge our misguided beliefs and grant us new truths.

How do we start? We realize how eternal the Universe is. Think how remarkable it is that light travels the same way now as it did 10 billion years ago. Now realize this applies to biology as well. Meaning life, wherever we have found it, from fossils to geysers, is always Darwinian.

That means all lifeforms instinctively play a grand competition, striving to survive and reproduce to pass on their genetics. As each generation exhibits slight variations, natural selection favors traits that enhance survival and reproductive success, driving the evolution of new species better suited to the changing environment. In short, as the world evolves, so must life; and its species run a relay race through time, each generation carrying the baton of creation forward until a new runner is needed.

We know these rules apply to your biology, but we do not yet realize these same laws apply to human civilization itself. Thus we need to amend Darwin's insights into new facts.

That's why this book is about you rejecting conventional wisdom and biological instincts and embracing a new, and seemingly outlandish, idea: that human life is primarily technological, and technological life is Darwinian. As past realizations about new truths allowed us to solve problems with space satellites and medicines, the benefits to this uncovered natural law are equally immense. We will finally clarify both our perspective and our place in the past, present, and future in the universe.

How?

Right now many in Gen Z are hoping to buy a car and own a home. Scores of retirees are hoping they will have the home healthcare they need to keep on living in their homes. Workers need more money, bosses need better workers. Conservatives worry about traditional values in a changing world, while Progressives exhaust themselves defending social changes. Technologists are bored using the technology of the future to make the toys of today. Wise people are worrying when our many debt bubbles might burst.

There is a long list of people in need and seeking answers. There are countless talking points vying for our attention. Given the endless content, if answers—which we just learned true answers are universal—were there, they should have been found by now. In truth, understanding our challenges requires us to put the pieces gathered by many others together and finally see what human life truly is.

Just another chapter in the ongoing story of evolution—but with a twist, evolution is now technological.

This change is nothing but a difference in material, one among the many that has taken place during the eons, epochs, ages in which Earth has had different geologies, atmospheres, environments, and lifeforms.

Life started in the Archean Eon over 3.4 billion years ago. Since then, there have been endless changes: trillions of lifeforms, perhaps a billion species, hundreds of ages, six mass extinctions—and now you.

The first step to understanding your place in the story is to realize life has been where you are today many times before, from the dinosaurs to the Stone Age man. It should not be a surprise Life already has a game plan for not only your survival, but prosperity. You can harness this knowledge, once you understand where you are in the plot.

By 1970, the foundational technologies of microchips, computers, and internet were converging. It is appropriate today's computers literally tell time—called Unix Time—by counting the seconds from January 1, 1970. The Internet Age was born a long time ago. It survived its youth (some did not embrace its inventions, hoping to unnaturally keep their own alive) and like some sort of mythical Greek god has grown exponentially more powerful ever since.

Yet today, decades later, we are still believing in the Industrial Age identities, philosophies, and products. _Techvolution On the Origin of Technological Species_ will empower you, whether someone in Gen Z hoping to start a family or a retiree hoping to have grandkids, to do what life has done many times before: leave the shadow of a bygone age behind and evolve to the new environment in which you live.

The first and most vital step in this journey is realizing the wacky idea that we are technological beings.

This book will give you the means to understand your technological identity, make smarter tool choices, and stop merely surviving Industrial Age obsolescence. Instead, you can select yourself to flourish in the Internet Age and thereby improve the fortunes of all who will follow us.

Techvolution: On the Origin of Technological Species presents a new way of understanding human civilization. It showcases how the human story is driven not by our beliefs or ideologies, but by the technologies we create and use. The journey from recognizing our technological nature to building a better world happens in three stages, each transforming a fundamental realm of human experience: individual identity, political discourse, and economic systems.

The journey from recognizing our technological nature to building a better world happens in three stages:

**Book I—A New Identity:** This foundational work introduces a "technological identity"—the idea that we humans are best understood through the tools and technologies we use to house ourselves, earn a living, and in general, interact with the world. While we have names for our nationality, ethnicity, employment, and politics, we lack consciousness of our technological nature.

Consider someone labeled "Californian, female, Hispanic, college graduate, progressive, regional manager"—yet none of these captures what matters most to her: it is 2011, high-speed internet is finally widespread, and she sells DVDs for a living. Because technological evolution is about to make physical media discs obsolete, her personal networks and knowledge base are now of questionable value. Yet, we have no name for this identity that might upend her life. This is but one example of why, from power tools to smartphones, our technological choices not only shape what we can do but who we should see in the mirror so we stop using biological instincts to live in a technological ecosystem.

**Book II—Mixed Ideological Politics:** Having established our technological identity, we must next liberate our toolsets from ideological constraints. Today, we often reject useful tools simply because of their political or cultural associations—renewable energy is labeled "green," diesel trucks "red-blooded American." These artificial divisions prevent us from combining technologies in optimal ways.

Mixed Ideological Politics teaches how to evaluate tools based purely on their effectiveness in solving our real-life problems, from the cost of home heating to increased storm activity. This new political philosophy prevents any ideology from blinding us to any worthy technology. In essence, this book is about learning political moderation in the modern age.

**Book III—Bumblebee Economics:** Once we combine technological self-awareness with ideology-free tool selection, we can create an economy as adaptive as life itself. Nature shows us the way. Her diverse biological species create collaborative ecosystems through simple rules of interaction. Bumblebee Economics applies this wisdom to our technological world. While we have already developed some open-source and interoperable technologies like USB and Bluetooth, we need an economic philosophy that accelerates their use to create a freely evolving technological ecosystem.

The goal is to create an ecosystem similar to Apple's, but more decentralized and dynamic: imagine medical records seamlessly flowing between a doctor's office, pharmacy, and your smartphone. All this via independent, yet standardized, programs that can evolve independently. Like bees and flowers co-evolving in a symbiotic relationship, this framework would enable technologies to adapt and grow, with users benefiting from increasingly capable and interconnected systems. With this approach, we can finally move on from the Industrial Age's mass-production mindset and embrace the era of mass collaboration in the Internet Age.

## About the Author

This book attempts a leap in human understanding. That is quite a bold task; I am not sure what qualifies anyone to undertake it. I have a quality formal education and have worked in various industries, which helps provide the means to think differently. I tried very hard (and it turns out foolishly) to get scientific data to prove these ideas. As you will learn, it turns out being thwarted in that task revealed more truths than the evidence would have.

As a kid in a grocery store, two friends were fighting over which cake to buy. Unable to participate for reasons you will soon learn about, I resolved to fix the tiresome bickering. So, I listened to both sides; one wanted chocolate the other vanilla. I left unnoticed and returned with a marbled cake. Both fell silent, and we soon enjoyed the taste of compromise as happy friends. It is a mentality I had and honed while looking out into our society, researching, and writing this book.
