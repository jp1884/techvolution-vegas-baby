## Giving You a Map and Compass

People used to think some wild things. The world was flat, the Earth was the center of the universe, disease was caused by bad air. Each of these beliefs was absolute—until some resisted accepted wisdom hard enough to uncover new truths.

It should make you wonder: what dark things do we believe? We should find out because, like in the past, these falsehoods mask serious problems and prevent the practical solutions that will improve our lives.

Here is a big misconception holding us back.

You, me, and most everyone else in the world are unconsciously using biological instincts to survive inside a technological ecosystem. And it is precisely this mismatch between our instincts and our environment that causes our fights over identities, political gridlock, and economic malaise.

The journey to fix these problems starts by accepting the power of universal laws.

Universal laws are our best guide because they are eternal. They never change. Just think how light travels the same way now as it did 10 billion years ago. This timelessness applies to physics, chemistry, and biology. Meaning life, wherever it takes hold, always plays the same Darwinian game of evolution.

We named the game after Charles Darwin because he decoded the natural law behind its rules. He showed how all lifeforms instinctively play a grand competition, striving to survive and reproduce to pass on their genetics. As each generation exhibits slight variations, natural selection favors traits that enhance survival and reproductive success, driving the evolution of new species better suited to the changing environment.

Of course, we now know these rules of evolution apply to our biology, but we do not yet realize these same laws apply to human civilization—and all the technologies that create, build, and power it, and by extension educate, house, and feed us.

That's why this book is about you rejecting conventional wisdom and embracing a new paradigm: that human life is now primarily technological, and technological life plays the Darwinian game of evolution.

As past realizations about new truths allowed us to solve problems with space satellites and medicines, the benefits to embracing this natural law are equally immense. 

Let me explain.

Right now Gen Z hopes to buy homes and cars. Retirees worry about affording retirement. Parents struggle with childcare costs while students graduate with crushing debt. Workers need more money, bosses need better workers. Small businesses watch tech giants dominate. Healthcare workers often fear bureaucracy more than illnesses. Conservatives worry about traditional values while Progressives defend social changes. Technologists create digital toys instead of empowering tools. Wise people worry when our many debt bubbles might burst.

From the well off hoping society holds together, to the needy tired of hoping, there is a long list of people in need and seeking answers. There are countless talking points on social media vying for our attention. If this massive amount of political content had answers they would have been found by now. 

Well-meaning influencers and analysts cannot find solutions, because in truth, each is rooted in biological identities and ideologies that do not account for the modern technological ecosystem we live in.

We can only overcome our challenges when we uncover the natural laws that show what modern human life truly is.

Just another chapter in the ongoing Darwinian game of evolution—but with a twist, life is now technological. This change is nothing but a difference in material, one among the many that has taken place during the eons, epochs, ages in which Earth has had different geologies, atmospheres, environments, and lifeforms.

That means life has felt your struggles many times before. It should not be a surprise there is a time-tested game plan for not only your survival, but prosperity.

And that is the evolution of new species better suited to win the game.

You can harness this winning playbook, once you realize we prosper by evolving new technologies, tools, and ways of life. Lucky for us, we have already created many technological adaptations to transform our civilization.

That is because in 1970, the foundational technologies of the next age—microchips, software, computers, and internet—were converging; the Industrial Age finally gave birth to the Internet Age. It was not long until amazing new digital products filled the world like so many offspring seeking to win their place in nature. Many established people and businesses did not embrace modern inventions, hoping to unnaturally keep their own technologies alive. Happily, progress was not stopped and a new age kept moving on the game board.

However, continued advancements are never assured. We are still clinging to Industrial Age identities, philosophies, and ways of life. We are seriously holding back the Internet Age by using these old ideas to select which modern technologies and adaptations live or die.

_Techvolution On the Origin of Technological Species_ will make the selection of technological species more natural. By empowering you, whether someone in Gen Z hoping to start a family or a retiree hoping to have grandkids, to do what life has done many times before: leave the shadows of a bygone age behind and purposefully evolve to the new environment in which you live.

Realizing the Earth was not the center of the Universe launched the Science Age. Likewise, to unleash the Internet Age means accepting that life is a game of evolution, and thus Earth is effectively a lifeboat of constantly tested survivors. We earn our place with technological evolution. Only by embracing this fact can we quickly unmask the new ideas and practical solutions we need to improve our lives.

On this journey you will uncover our technological identity, be empowered to make smarter tool choices, and stop merely surviving Industrial Age obsolescence. With these lessons, you can select yourself to flourish in the Internet Age and thereby improve the fortunes of all who will follow us.

## Book Series

_Techvolution: On the Origin of Technological Species_ presents a new way of understanding human civilization. It showcases how the human story is driven not by our beliefs or ideologies, but by the technologies we create and use. The journey from recognizing our technological nature to building a better world happens as we transform three interconnected realms: individual identity, political discourse, and economic systems.

**Book I—A New Identity:** This foundational work introduces a "technological identity"—the idea that we humans are best understood through the tools and technologies we use to house ourselves, earn a living, and in general, interact with the world. While we have names for our nationality, ethnicity, employment, and politics, we lack consciousness of our technological nature.

Consider someone labeled "Californian, female, Hispanic, college graduate, progressive, regional manager"—yet none of these captures what matters most to her: it is 2011, high-speed internet is finally widespread, and she sells DVDs for a living. Because technological evolution is about to make physical media discs obsolete, her personal networks and knowledge base are now of questionable value. Yet, we have no name for this identity that might upend her life. This is but one example of why, from power tools to smartphones, our technological choices not only shape what we can do but who we should see in the mirror.

Only then will we stop using biological instincts to live in a technological ecosystem.

**Book II—Mixed Ideological Politics:** Having established our technological identity, we must next liberate our toolsets from ideological constraints. Today, we often reject useful tools simply because of their political or cultural associations—renewable energy is labeled "green," diesel trucks "red-blooded American." These artificial divisions prevent us from combining technologies in optimal ways.

Mixed Ideological Politics teaches how to evaluate tools based purely on their effectiveness in solving our real-life problems, from the cost of home heating to increased storm activity. This new political philosophy prevents any ideology from blinding us to any worthy technology. In essence, this book is about learning political moderation in the modern age.

**Book III—Bumblebee Economics:** Once we combine technological self-awareness with ideology-free tool selection, we can create an economy as adaptive as life itself. Nature shows us the way. Her diverse biological species create collaborative ecosystems through simple rules of interaction. Bumblebee Economics applies this wisdom to our technological world. While we have already developed some open-source and interoperable technologies like USB and Bluetooth, we need an economic philosophy that accelerates their use to create a freely evolving technological ecosystem.

The goal is to create an ecosystem similar to Apple's, but more decentralized and dynamic: imagine medical records seamlessly flowing between a doctor's office, pharmacy, and your smartphone. All this via independent, yet standardized, programs that can evolve independently. Like bees and flowers co-evolving in a symbiotic relationship, this framework would enable technologies to adapt and grow, with users benefiting from increasingly capable and interconnected systems. With this approach, we can finally add to the Industrial Age's mass-production of generic adaptations to find countless untapped niches via the era of mass collaboration in the Internet Age.

## About the Author

This book attempts a leap in human understanding. That is quite a bold task; I am not sure what qualifies anyone to undertake it. I have a quality formal education and have worked in various industries, which helps grounds a mind when trying think differently. I tried very hard (and it turns out quite foolishly) to get scientific data to showcase techvolution. As you will learn, it turns out being thwarted in that task revealed more truths than the evidence would have.

As a kid in a grocery store, two friends were fighting over which cake to buy. Unable to participate for reasons you will soon learn about, I resolved to fix the tiresome bickering. So, I listened to both sides; one wanted chocolate the other vanilla. I left unnoticed and returned with a marbled cake. Both fell silent, and we soon enjoyed the taste of compromise as happy friends. It is a mentality I had and honed while looking out into our society, researching, and writing this book.
