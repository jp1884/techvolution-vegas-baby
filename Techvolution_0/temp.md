## Giving You a Map and Compass

Dinosaurs ruled for eons. Are now remembered as fossils.

Kings and queens took command of seas and forests. People rebelled with sticks and stones, many died. Man one day yelled "no taxation without representation" behind a musket and won a country. Women were told to stay in the kitchen. Now she is told get back in your cubicle. Guy puts in a claim and is told take it or leave it. Lady says no and losses her stardom. Protests, gunshots, hashtags.

We have learned evolution applies to biology, but when a person holds a spoon in gunfight. In evolutionary terms the winner is obvious. But we do not see it the obvious because we do not see ourselves as technological beings. Thus, we describe winners and losers using biological terms like gender, ethnicity, and race. To improve our future, we need to correct that.

Then again dinosaurs ruled for eons. And now once giants, are remembered as fossils. Mammals scurried from shadows, inherited the world. 

Humans mastered fire. Planted crops, built cities. Kings commanded with obsidian, then bronze, then steel. Soon "We hold these truths to be self-evident," was declared, and empires toppled behind muskets and pamphlets and ballots.

Today we carry supercomputers in our pockets. Yet women freed from kitchens are told get back into cubicles. Guy puts in a claim and is told take it or leave it. Ladies say "no" and lose their stardom. Seas rising, debt growing, fixes not working. Youth layoffs, food banks, protests, gunshots, hashtags.

Evolution applies to biology, we know, nut not only biology. Tools evolve too. Words versus guns, fists versus computers—the winner is obvious. Not to us. We describe winners and losers using biological terms: gender, ethnicity, race.

Wrong lens. Old paradigm. We can do better.

The world is change. It all started with the formation of the first cells. Matter learned to harvest energy. Life divided, altered, expanded. Motion brought choices. Senses brought information. Pain told us in real-time the difference between good and bad. More harvests were reaped and so more lifeforms were born.

The world got covered from tip to toe. Bacteria, fungus, plants and insects. Dinosaurs ruled with teeth and claws. Asteroid struck. Birds and mammals inherited the Earth.

Eons passed. Fire was tamed, metal struck, sails unfurled. Kings commanded with swords and ships. People rebelled—first with stone, they failed, then with pikes and swords, victory was won for some. Then the cried 'No taxation without representation!' behind a musket, and more joined the victorious.

People used to think some wild things. The world was flat, the Earth was the center of the universe, disease was caused by bad air. Each of these beliefs was absolute—until some resisted accepted wisdom hard enough to uncover new truths.

It should make you wonder: what dark things do we believe? We should find out because, like in the past, these falsehoods mask serious problems and prevent the practical solutions that will improve our lives.

Here is a big misconception holding us back.

You, me, and most everyone else in the world are unconsciously using biological instincts to survive inside a technological ecosystem. And it is precisely this mismatch between our instincts and our environment that causes our fights over identities, political gridlock, and economic malaise.

The journey to fix these problems starts by accepting the power of universal laws.....

## Giving You a Map and Compass

In 1945, a technical genius predicted the world we live in today. Before anyone sent an email or browsed Wikipedia, Vannevar Bush thought it up. He was fighting World War II, and dreamed computer technology would cure the human condition.

Technologists were inspired. Soon they were creating transistors, mainframes, and taking pictures of Earth from the moon. As technology got smaller and cheaper in the 1970s, computers and the internet started to spread throughout the planet.

Yet, many indicators of human and biological quality of life got worse. The sixth mass extinction is underway, government debt is at historic highs, individuals are facing declining wealth, increased isolation, and rising debt, and political partisanship has become the norm.

Evidently computer technology did not cure anything. 

But it has. Cancer, bacteria, hunger, and so many more pains are lower now then every before because of modern technology.

Our problem is us.

Technology changed and we did not. You, me, and most everyone else in the world are unconsciously using biological instincts to survive inside a new and ever advancing technological ecosystem. And it is this mismatch between our instincts and our environment that causes our fights over identities, political gridlock, and economic malaise.

Thus, we are suffering for the same reason why those who thought the Earth was the center of the universe did. Our premise is wrong. 

The journey to adopt a new paradigm starts by accepting the power of universal laws.

Universal laws are our best guide because they are eternal. Just think how light travels the same way now as it did 10 billion years ago. This timelessness applies to physics, chemistry, and biology. Meaning life, wherever it takes hold, always plays the same Darwinian game of evolution.

We named the game after Charles Darwin because he decoded much of its rules. He showed how all lifeforms instinctively play a grand competition, striving to survive and reproduce to pass on their genetics. As each generation exhibits slight variations, natural selection favors traits that enhance survival and reproductive success, driving the evolution of new species better suited to the changing environment.

Of course, we know these rules of evolution apply to our biology, but our current paradigm does not let us see these same laws apply to human civilization—and all the technologies that create, build, and power it, and by extension educate, house, and feed us.

That's why this book is about you rejecting conventional wisdom and embracing a new paradigm: that human life is now primarily technological, and technological life is Darwinian.

As past realizations about new truths allowed us to solve problems with space satellites and medicines, the benefits to embracing this natural law today are equally immense. 

Let me explain.

Right now many in Gen Z are hoping to buy a car and own a home. Scores of retirees are hoping they will have the healthcare they need to live comfortable retirements. Workers need more money, bosses need better workers. Conservatives worry about traditional values in a changing world, while Progressives exhaust themselves defending social changes. Technologists are bored using the technology of the future to make the toys of today. Wise people are worrying when our many debt bubbles might burst.

There is a long list of people in need and seeking answers. There are countless talking points on social media vying for our attention. If this massive amount of political content had answers, they would have been found by now. 

Well-meaning influencers and analysts cannot find solutions, because in truth, each is rooted in a old paradigm that does not account for the technological ecosystem we live in. Hence, they apply biological identities such as race, gender, and ethnicity, to technological problems.

To overcome our challenges requires us to uncover natural laws and finally adopt a world view that sees what modern human life truly is.

Just another chapter in the ongoing game of evolution—but with a twist, evolution is now technological. This change is nothing but a difference in material, one among the many that has taken place during the eons, epochs, ages in which Earth has had different geologies, atmospheres, environments, and lifeforms.

That means life has been where you are today many times before. It should not be a surprise there is a time-tested game plan for not only your survival, but prosperity.

And that is the evolution of new species better suited to win the game.

We already have the technology. Thus, you can only harness this winning playbook, once you realize we must evolve new ways of life to reap the benefits of new technology.

We have not been doing that. 

As mentioned, in 1970, the foundational technologies of the next age—microchips, computers, and internet—were converging; the Internet Age was born. It was not long until amazing new digital products filled the world like so many offspring seeking to win their place on the field. Sadly, some did not embrace its inventions, hoping to unnaturally keep their own alive. Happily, progress was not stopped and a new age kept evolving.

However, continued advancements are never assured. We are seriously holding back the Internet Age by using biological identities and ideological beliefs to select which modern technologies and adaptations live or die.

_Techvolution On the Origin of Technological Species_ will make the selection of technological species more natural. By empowering you, whether someone in Gen Z hoping to start a family or a retiree hoping to have grandkids, to do what life has done many times before: leave the shadows of a bygone age behind and purposefully evolve to the new environment in which you live.

Realizing the Earth was not the center of the Universe launched the Science Age. Likewise, by realizing Earth is a lifeboat with time only for evolutionary winners, means we humans must embrace our technological evolution. Only then can we quickly unmask many new ideas and practical solutions of the Internet Age to improve our lives.

The journey will transformative. We will uncover our technological identity, empower you to make smarter tool choices, and learn to stop merely surviving Industrial Age obsolescence. With these lessons, you can select yourself to flourish in the Internet Age and thereby improve the fortunes of all who will follow us.
