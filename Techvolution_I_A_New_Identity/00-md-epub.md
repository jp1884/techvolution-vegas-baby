# Techvolution: On the Origin of Technological Species

# Book I: A New Identity

# Back Page Summary

Who are you? What truly defines your identity in this age of massive technological change?

Techvolution is a new framework that helps us understand ourselves, our society, and our rapidly changing world.

We need guidance understanding this transformation. From smartphones that connect us globally to medical devices that extend our lifespans, new technologies have become so pervasive that they are now permanent extensions of our biological selves, profoundly transforming how we live, work, and interact. In the eyes of evolution, we are becoming something unprecedented—"technological beings," chosen not for our genetics or life experiences, but by our ability to create and harness tools.

As we embrace our technological identity, we begin to see how the principles of evolution—adaptation, selection, and speciation—now govern our societies, political systems, and economies. Accepting evolution's control over us is a new paradigm that empowers us to:

- Understand human history through technological evolution
- Embrace new technologies instead of fearing the loss of our jobs
- Lower living costs with faster adoption of innovations
- Transform ideological divisions into technological collaboration

Whether you are a business owner, policymaker, or someone seeking deeper insight into the human condition, _Techvolution_ is an essential new framework for understanding our rapidly changing world. With this new paradigm, you will emerge with a profound new perspective on your place in history and the extraordinary future that awaits us as self-aware technological beings.

# Inner Flap

For centuries, humanity has defined itself through ideologies: belief systems and cultural narratives that shape our worldview. But what if, in fact, these identities have obscured the true driver of our advancement?

In _Techvolution_, you will confront this provocative question as you discover that our technological evolution, not our ideological beliefs, holds the key to understanding human civilization and your place within it. Consider how forging steel revolutionized society or how AI currently challenges our notion of human uniqueness. New technology does not just change our products—it changes who we are.

What truly distinguishes our species from other life forms is not language or culture, but our continual creation of new tools. This technological evolution defines our fate more fundamentally than gender, ethnicity, or nationality ever could. Just as natural selection shapes biological life, technological evolution determines our species’ future.

With this insight, we can base our identity, politics, and economics on evolution's fundamental principles. By aligning our beliefs with these natural mechanisms, we can unlock many practical benefits: reduced living costs through faster technology adoption, collaborative solutions to climate challenges, and fostering innovation that autonomously heals human pain.

Technology is a new branch on the tree of life. Just as the study of evolution illuminated the natural world, the study of technological evolution will reveal the intricacies of our technological life.

Spanning the breadth of human history, _Techvolution_ reframes the human story by placing our technological nature at its center. For those seeking to understand our rapidly changing times, this book provides more than just insight—it offers an intellectual blueprint for the extraordinary future we are building together as a technological species.

# Dedication

_This book is for the open-source community—for the collaborative mindset you handed down to me while updating Wikipedia, writing free software, and answering endless questions on Stack Overflow. You showed a philosophy student what the future could be as you became the protagonists of the Internet Age. Still, while you create many innovative frameworks and side projects, the world urgently needs you to use this book and others to construct the Internet Age economy, build step by build step, posthaste._

_This book is especially dedicated to the middle class. Our society's stubborn loyalty to the Industrial Age way of life has stagnated our economy and poisoned our political discourse. I pray you embrace the evolutionary changes necessary and reach for the Internet Age future that open-source heroes have made available for us, while we still can._

# Series of Works

_Techvolution: On the Origin of Technological Species_ presents a new way of understanding human civilization. It showcases how the human story is driven not by our beliefs or ideologies, but by the technologies we create and use. In a series of books, we explore how becoming self-aware of our technological nature transforms three interconnected realms: individual identity, political discourse, and economic systems.

**Book I—A New Identity:** This foundational work introduces a "technological identity"—the idea that we humans are best understood through the tools and technologies we use to house ourselves, earn a living, and in general, interact with the world. While we have names for our nationality, ethnicity, employment, and politics, we lack consciousness of our technological nature.

Consider someone labeled "Californian, female, Hispanic, college graduate, progressive, regional manager"—yet none of these captures what matters most to her: it is 2011, high-speed internet is finally widespread, and she sells DVDs for a living. Because technological evolution is about to make physical media discs obsolete, her personal networks and knowledge base are now of questionable value. Yet, we have no name for this identity that might upend her life. This is but one example of why, from power tools to smartphones, our technological choices not only shape what we can do but who we should see in the mirror.

**Book II—Mixed Ideological Politics:** Having established our technological identity, we must next liberate our toolsets from ideological constraints. Today, we often reject useful tools simply because of their political or cultural associations—renewable energy is labeled "green," diesel trucks "red-blooded American." These artificial divisions prevent us from combining technologies in optimal ways.

Mixed Ideological Politics teaches how to evaluate tools based purely on their effectiveness in solving our real-life problems, from the cost of home heating to increased storm activity. This new political philosophy prevents any ideology from blinding us to any worthy technology. In essence, this book is about learning political moderation in the modern age.

**Book III—Bumblebee Economics:** Once we combine technological self-awareness with ideology-free tool selection, we can create an economy as adaptive as life itself. Nature shows us the way. Her diverse biological species create collaborative ecosystems through simple rules of interaction. Bumblebee Economics applies this wisdom to our technological world. While we have already developed some open-source and interoperable technologies like USB and Bluetooth, we need an economic philosophy that accelerates their use to create a freely evolving technological ecosystem.

The goal is to create an ecosystem similar to Apple's, but more decentralized and dynamic: imagine medical records seamlessly flowing between a doctor's office, pharmacy, and your smartphone. All this via independent, yet standardized, programs that can evolve independently. Like bees and flowers co-evolving in a symbiotic relationship, this framework would enable technologies to adapt and grow, with users benefiting from increasingly capable and interconnected systems. With this approach, we can finally move on from the Industrial Age's mass-production mindset and embrace the era of mass collaboration in the Internet Age.

`Understand yourself → Learn to use different tools → Work effectively with others`

# Preface

To most people, corner stores only house quick conveniences. To kids, they are wonderlands of comics and candy, magical spaces where imagination and sweetness live in harmony.

I loved visiting my local store. I would casually browse the options, select a comic and treat, and happily hand over cash to the kind shop owner. A slice from the pizzeria next door always completed the perfect day.

But there lived a real super-villain.

I would stare at it through the "PIZZA" letters on the storefront. Only if there were one kind of slice available could I bypass the tyrant and get the slice I so wanted.

Was the villain poverty? Meekness? Or perhaps it was the pizza cook who disliked my religion or family? The answer is none of these. The truth is far more fundamental and reveals the core message of the book.

I wanted a slice of pizza. Getting it required speaking, and I did not have the ability to do that, as I was born with a speech impediment—a condition affecting about three million Americans from all ages and walks of life. That is why I turned away when the pizza counter had several kinds of slices. I feared, far more than going hungry, being asked "which one" if there were several.

The affliction kicks in when certain sounds trigger a stutter that feels like a severe electric shock. Speaking to strangers makes it worse. Swearing offers blessed relief, but that solution only works among friends.

Modern science has illuminated many of our biological conditions, providing explanations and remedies. In that vein, I was very lucky to receive government-sponsored speech therapy. So, although I was subject to a genetic misfire between thought and speech, I learned I was not a broken person, just someone with a broken tool. I still remember my graduation ceremony at an Italian restaurant.

I got to order anything I wanted. It was pizza, of course.

The point of this story is that when a person confronts a problem today—from buying products to getting a job—we instinctively start with a genetic, cultural, or ethnic identity. Listen to any political speech; it will speak to "single mothers," "elderly voters," "new immigrants," or some other demographic group. I do not want to invalidate these identities, only to clarify something fundamental: in the realm of politics and economics, we are first and foremost users of tools.

Some of these tools are biological, like speaking, but with the explosion of electronics, software, and so many other devices, most of our interactions with the world are now technological. Therefore, our primary identities should be defined by the tools at our disposal, and acquiring better tools to live happier lives ought to be our first priority.

A technological identity is precisely what ideologies strip away from us. For example, an ideologue seeing a hungry kid outside a pizzeria window might attribute the kid's situation to a personal failing—like being irresponsible with money—or systemic injustices—like family poverty or discrimination by the shop owner. Both perspectives are possible, but the fact that the kid might be struggling with a "verbal wheelchair" rarely occurs to people. This oversight happens not because they are unaware of disabilities, but because ideological interpretations are often our default lens when seeing problems in society.

That should not be too surprising. Our ideologies have guided our mindsets for generations. Given the massive technological ecosystem we now enjoy, they have done an admirable job. Yet, conservatism, progressivism, and other belief systems were conceived centuries ago by people seeking to solve their society's problems, primarily addressing the hunger, illiteracy, and poverty of civilization before the Industrial Revolution.

Ideological thinkers still offer valuable insights into societal communication and governance, but their worldview is not rooted in our modern scientific and technological world. They lived without plastic, wrote with bird feathers, and did not learn how evolution shaped the state of nature. Thus, we should not pick one ideology in order to conquer the others. Instead, they are frameworks to be studied as we integrate a technological identity into our consciousness.

In fact, conservatism's emphasis on producing wealth and progressivism's drive for social diversity become complementary forces when viewed through a technological identity.

Conservatism and progressivism empower each other because diversity and mass production are how life populates and updates its ecosystems. Thus, rather than seeing left versus right as opposing forces, we can view them as complementary perspectives contributing to our collective technological evolution.

Of course, as we know, modern progressives and conservatives do not cooperate. For example, Congressional partisanship has been increasing exponentially for over sixty years with no sign of abating or reversing.

As our economic challenges continue to mount, the statistics paint a stark picture of financial strain. Since 1991, Americans' wages have not even kept pace with inflation. Median household income has grown by just 27.9 percent over thirty years, while the cost of living has dramatically outpaced this modest increase. Housing prices have soared 345 percent. Health-care premiums have risen 49 percent between 2013 and 2023. Public college tuition has more than doubled. More recently, grocery costs have risen significantly, with a 20-30% increase from 2020 to 2025.

Unsurprisingly, this widening economic gap has driven debt to unprecedented levels. Student loan debt exploded from nearly $481 billion in 2006 to over $1.7 trillion by 2021. For young adults aged 18-24, mortgage costs tell a similar story—average home debt jumped from under $40,000 in 1992 to $117,000 in 2022. Economic betterment has stopped, with only half of Americans now able to earn more than their parents, compared to 90 percent in 1940.

These are not just cold statistics—they represent a systemic failure. Many ideologues believe that better government policy alone can address our challenges, but evolution demands more: we must adapt by innovating and adopting new tools.

To appease evolution, we must redefine ourselves as technological beings first and foremost. Only that person will critically assess everyone's opinions, PowerPoint presentations, and other narratives on their actual effectiveness in connecting problems with better technologies.

To understand this mindset, consider a simple experiment: combine cold water and ice into a bucket. As you immerse your hand in the water, the cold steals your heat, and your body soon experiences intense pain. This visceral moment reveals a fundamental truth: no words, presentations, or promises keep you warm.

Thus, when evaluating conservatism, progressivism, or any belief system, always judge not by its words, but by its ability to create and distribute tools that overcome your environmental challenges and thereby lower your real-life pains. Most everyone, from bureaucrats to teachers, already says they promote innovation, but only a technological identity will keep all of us honest.

Then we will be in evolution's good graces.

And that is a good place to be. Life has spent billions of years combating heat, hunger, thirst, and cold through adaptation. Arctic fish develop antifreeze proteins. Polar birds grow waterproof feathers. Mammals develop fur and blubber. Each organism's survival depends not on avoiding discomfort, but on developing the right tools to keep pain away in its environment.

Our ancestors lost their insulating hair when they left the trees and learned to walk. How did we stay warm? We cut fur from dead animals and mastered fire. Today, we synthesize materials, generate heat, and create any other solution we can dream up. And while we have gotten very good at reducing our pains, that also means we can easily forget what life on Earth is all about.

Hence, we tend to view the world through human stories, speeches, and ideologies, rather than addressing practical problems as life demands.

Adopting a strong technological identity will make it far easier to stay on the mission of evolution that life gives all creatures. A new identity does not mean abandoning any of our wonderful cultures. We can still enjoy music clubs, celebrate folklore dances, commemorate history, and cheer at the Olympics. However, in a world increasingly shaped by technological systems, we must develop a new mindset to clearly identify our problems and see their best solutions.

Loving the same music as someone else is great fun, but that does not mean you have found the best mechanic. Shared problems create the best political and economic relationships. Just look at how an oak tree and a squirrel benefit each other. One feeds the other, while one seeds the other, and yet they have nothing else in common.

All life forms should work together because Earth is a massive bucket—a vast game board shaped by immutable laws of physics, chemistry, and geology. Life plays the game by constantly creating new creatures so that its partner, evolution, can decide who the players will be. With the right team, Earth is an awe-inspiring oasis—a lone lifeboat in the galactic expanse.

The story of life now involves technology. Its many gadgets, tools, and inventions are already changing the world. The purpose of this book is to help you find the tools that solve the problems of your environment. A recurring theme is how to combat any story that tries to subvert our evolutionary requirement.

Earth will prosper to new heights when human conflict is minimized and cooperation is maximized, not through wishful storytelling or ideological idealism, but through the innate drive that propels all life to seek resources, evade threats, form alliances, and adapt. This drive often shows up in everyday situations—such as what I learned as a child when ordering pizza—because our limitations are not who we are, but challenges that better teammates and tools can solve. Techvolution provides a new framework to understand this paradigm and consciously supports the evolution of life on Earth.


# Introduction 

### Catching Life's Eye

Animals are born free, and everywhere they seem to be enjoying themselves. Nature is no doubt a tough place to be. Hunger, disease, thirst, and predation are always just around the corner. Yet, from the mighty grizzly bear to the tiny firefly, organisms all fight to stay alive. It seems creatures enjoy playing the "game of life".

So, how does a life form get selected to become a player? There are three ways to stand out: genes, personality, and tools.

Genes are a creature's blueprint. Each DNA segment provides specific instructions that determine an organism's traits. During reproduction, genes shuffle and recombine, introducing variations in offspring. Most variations are minor and neutral, but occasionally a mutation provides a survival advantage.

Consider the peppered moth during England's Industrial Revolution. As trees darkened due to smog and soot, a rare dark variant of the peppered moth gained a camouflage advantage and its numbers surged. Evolution did not create this mutation; rather, it favored the black moth through natural selection—a process that eliminates harmful genes while allowing organisms with beneficial traits to survive and reproduce.

This continuous process of genetic variation and environmental selection drives the incremental changes we observe in species over time—sometimes slowly, as with glacial changes as geology changes over eons, or suddenly with events like floods, eruptions, or factory soot. Natural selection can only work with what already exists, thus evolution favors genetic diversity of all kinds because it increases the likelihood of producing life forms that can survive and reproduce in changing environments.

The next way a creature can stand out is its phenotype. The phenotype is akin to a life form's personality; the observable characteristics of an organism resulting from the interaction between its genetic makeup and environmental influences, encompassing physical traits, behavioral adaptations, and learned experiences. Think of two acorns, one planted in a tall forest, the other in an open field. The first grows lean and tall to reach sunlight, while the other grows bushier and more robust. Phenotype reveals how organisms adapt to their surroundings and become products of their environment.

Phenotypic adaptations show remarkable diversity. Some are immediate, like a lizard changing color for camouflage, while others develop over generations, such as an elephant mother teaching her young where the water holes are. Natural selection does not prefer one phenotype over another; like with genes, it wants huge diversity to increase the chance of finding those best suited to survive and reproduce in the current environment.

The third way creatures stand out is the extended phenotype. These are adaptations that creatures build for themselves. Think of bird nests, beaver dams, and ant hills. Although made of foreign material, these things act like any other organ by helping a creature better survive.

Take the common squirrel as an example. The small creature survives frigid winters by storing food and building warm nests. These adaptations greatly increase its survival rate. Extended phenotypes empower organisms to mold their environment to their benefit and thereby select themselves for survival.

Unlike genes and phenotypes, extended phenotypes become part of the environment and are available for other creatures to use. For example, crabs use seashells, ants occupy termite hills, and bats inhabit old bird nests. This shows that the creator of an extended phenotype is not always its user.

Raccoons are the ultimate example. Originally from the tropical forests of Central America, these intelligent creatures naturally create dens in hollow trees and grow thicker fur and fat stores for winter. However, unlike squirrels, raccoons do not naturally insulate their burrows, store food, or fully hibernate. Still, they have managed to spread their range across North America, all because of human civilization's barns, garages, and garbage. Although raccoons created none of these things, they can use them, and therefore life selects them in great numbers, even though, unlike squirrels, who plant millions of nuts each year, raccoons have no reciprocal contribution to the technological ecosystem that provides for them.

So, to stay a player in the game of life, creatures can stand out via their genes, phenotypes, and extended phenotypes. The right mixture means an animal can harvest enough resources and protect itself long enough to procreate and thereby keep playing the game.

Now, in our quest to better understand ourselves, which of these scenarios do you think best describes humans in the 21st century?

### Doesn't My Insurance Cover This?

The answer is the raccoon. Like them, we live, work, and exist in an ecosystem of tools without knowing how they work. This is why the thesis of this book is that humans are now primarily a technological species that is not yet self-aware of our new identity. I will use my story again to explain why.

Among my many genetic traits is the aforementioned speech impediment. Centuries ago, it would have been debilitating. Belief systems were more mythological, leading many to believe that a stutterer was a simpleton and a candidate for neglect or worse. I can sympathize; in childhood, I was thought to be one because I rarely talked. But when the problem was identified at my elementary school, a speech therapist was assigned, and the shackles of my genetic heritage began to be removed.

I still had the resulting shyness of my phenotype to overcome. That story is like that of most people growing up, with kids unconsciously adapting to their social environment as best they can. However, the impediment resurfaced when my software employer said my speech impediment was still noticeable, so I resolved to fix it with a job in a notoriously chaotic insurance claims call center. Within a year, the "sink or swim" kind of shock speech therapy finally worked out most of my speaking tool's glitches.

My experience is not unique; many people face similar challenges, from social anxiety to dyslexia. The key point is that we now have numerous ways to address these issues. Advances in science—such as mapping the human genome—and in psychology—with various therapies—provide significant support. Unlike in the past, when even Julius Caesar had to hide his epilepsy, we have great help available once a person chooses to use it. Evolution now has little reason to reject individuals based on their genotype or phenotype.

As for the extended phenotype, before the Industrial Revolution, we were often like squirrels using tools made from the natural world. Technology still amazed us, but things such as sod houses, wood saws, and paper books are physical objects easy to hold, safe to smell, and natural to the touch. However, after the massive explosion of chemicals, materials, electricity, electronics, software, and so many other things over the past 150 years, we are now like raccoons who depend on things we do not truly understand.

I know this in my soul. After my speech improved as a claims adjuster, I looked around and realized how valuable the job was. I processed more than 7,000 claims and spoke with more than 30,000 people from all walks of life. By getting into people's shoes when their furnaces died, cars crashed, or houses flooded, the job is basically a massive experiment on our economy for anyone empathetic enough to listen to people's pains. For a political economy student, being a claims adjuster was an intellectual gold mine.

The ultimate lesson was how people struggle to understand modern technologies. We live in a world of increasing complexity but diminishing comprehension. From wealthy executives to blue-collar workers, everyone is equally perplexed by a car crash or a malfunctioning piece of technology. People rarely understand their own possessions or the rules governing their use, yet continue buying and selling technology, always one glitch away from asking, "Doesn't my insurance cover this?" to a person on the phone as if I had a magic wand to erase their problems.

I was so often a customer's best hope, yet all I had was a Google search and a stingy checkbook.

Modern technology has changed how evolution selects us. Comparing top causes of death in modern America and ancient societies (circa 500 BC) reveals our new selection pressure. Modern America's list is dominated by chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes, linked to our sedentary lifestyle that is so pervasive raccoons suffer from many of the same problems. In contrast, ancient societies suffered greatly from infectious diseases and injuries due to poor sanitation, limited medical care, and frequent wars. Notably, infant mortality has dropped dramatically, from approximately 50 percent in the Bronze Age to under 0.8 percent in America today.

Unless a sudden catastrophe like factory soot or a meteor impact occurs, species typically die off gradually. Our falling birthrate is a prime example. While many blame younger generations for being negligent, the evolutionary truth is more complex: our economy remains trapped in a bygone era's lifestyle. Baby boomers continue to monopolize resources and block technological evolution, inadvertently clinging to the so-called "American Dream" rooted in their upbringing in the 1950s and 1960s.

As a result, instead of adopting new tools to solve modern problems, we work to re-create the past with endless movie remakes, "all-new" car commercials, and more suburban housing, shopping centers, and office parks. It is not anyone's fault; we simply lack self-awareness of our technological identity and the evolutionary imperative to embrace change.

The suburban, car-dependent culture and the idea of a lifelong career are becoming increasingly unsustainable. They are struggling—if not dying—branches on the tree of life. Yet, we do not have an identity that accepts these pains and uses modern tools to create a new way of life.

Boomers inadvertently limit younger generations' economic opportunities by maintaining outdated office technologies and work cultures. By preserving familiar Microsoft Office tools, traditional commuting patterns, and love of offshoring, they unintentionally restrict technological evolution. Most lack understanding of modern technologies like HTML, SQL, and 3D printers, reducing potential innovations to mere consumer products rather than transformative tools that makes human reproduction easier.

For example, an insurance appraiser I worked with used a measuring wheel to measure the dimensions of large commercial buildings, taking days to complete what others did in hours with lasers. Another boomer, the CEO, banned smartphones for adjusters, insisting on landline phones despite customers already embracing faster communication in their daily lives. Again, nobody intends to be obstinate, but those with outdated skill sets have good reason to resist the change new tools on the tree of life bring.

The youth recognize that their future is being sacrificed, which is reflected in the huge popularity of dystopian stories like _The Hunger Games_ and _Divergent_ in young adult fiction. Techvolution offers an alternative: by understanding technological evolution, we can transform our sense of powerlessness into agency, turning dystopian fears into a roadmap for deliberate, positive change.

The key lesson is that evolution cannot select us for our best intentions. Despite natural selection constantly rejecting many aspects of our modern lifestyle, we remain too fixated on our genes and personality to listen and adapt. To purposefully evolve a better way of life, we must tune our identity to seek out, embrace, and protect new tools that are, for now, being held back.

This is not a proclamation against boomers. Because, as the history of depressions or total collapses goes, be it Royalist France or the Soviet Union, it is the elderly pensioners who see their benefits cut the worst, and thus they should be the first to fix our society's worsening problems.

To solve our problems with upgraded tools, we need to see ourselves as we are.

Consider this: what is more concerning—spraining an ankle or having water pipes burst during vacation? Our ancestors might fear a lion when facing a physical injury, but today we would simply rest and watch Netflix. However, burst pipes could bankrupt you. I should know; I had to deny claims because homeowners broke the unknown conditions of their insurance policies. If they had been technologically self-aware enough to perform a simple two-minute water shut-off, they could have prevented years of hardship and earned a nod from evolution

Yet, we rarely examine the "extended phenotype" part of ourselves. We remain barely conscious of our technological identities and fail to proactively develop skills that would satisfy evolutionary pressures. Far more people define themselves by gender, race, or heritage, compared to the tools they use to gather resources. Technological identity reveals who we truly are when we strip away labels—the tools we use, the problems we solve, and our ability to adapt and survive in a constantly changing world.

Unaware of most modern tools, we resemble raccoons opportunistically using technology we encounter, believing things like genetics, education, or ideologies explain our success or failure. As evolution penalizes our ignorance, we must look in the mirror and be honest about what we see: people who passionately discuss human genes and/or personality, but are in reality fighting to control tools, even ones as simple as a pencil.

### Avoiding Evolution's Stare

Charles Darwin proposed evolution in 1859. His idea was radical, challenging much of the established knowledge of the time. Religious individuals believed Earth was only a few thousand years old, while scientific thinkers estimated perhaps a few million years; everyone knew that if all life forms had evolved from a common ancestor, as Darwin suggested, then more time was surely needed to account for the diversity seen on Earth.

Because evolution explained the observable world so precisely, evidence accumulated rapidly, transforming both scientific and popular understanding. Within decades, humanity adopted a new paradigm of evolution via natural selection, and scientists demonstrated its intricate mechanisms—ecosystems, co-evolution, genetic variation, and speciation—that populated our planet with an astonishing diversity of life over billions of years.

Simultaneously, fields such as physics, chemistry, geology, and mathematics were advancing, enriching humanity with wonders like electricity, medical cures, and aviation. As nature revealed its mysteries, one might ask: Why did we not apply evolution's principles to our own civilization?

We attempted to do so, but because we saw only genotype or phenotype in our reflection, we were destined to fail. Remember that evolution does not prescribe good ideas; it simply selects out the bad ones. Two of the worst ideas ever subjected to evolutionary forces were fascism and communism. These two ideologies attempted to purify either the genotype or phenotype and thereby impose their own selective criteria on humanity through eugenics and social engineering, respectively.

Of course, humanity has had many bad ideas before. But fascism and communism were particularly horrible because they had access to modern science, which they tried to use to validate their false premises. Genotype-focused fascist and Nazi scientists developed theories that attributed human success solely to genetics—for example, claiming that head shape determined intelligence. Phenotype-focused communist and Soviet scientists insisted on absolute genetic equality, attributing all success to environmental factors, even in cases like plant seeds.

With access to modern machinery, mathematics, and other advancements, one ideology enacted mass imprisonment, forced sterilization, and the Holocaust, while the other did mass incarcerations and executions during the Great Purges and caused devastating famines through agricultural policies that criminalized genetic studies and planted crops unsuited to local climates.

While eugenics and social engineering were tried in our society, our ideologies predate evolutionary understanding, making it easier to move beyond ill-conceived attempts at genotype or phenotype purification. However, the debate persists in a more nuanced form in the ongoing "nature versus nurture" debate between conservatives and progressives. The former emphasizes generating wealth through genetic potential and minimal government intervention, and the latter focuses on distributing wealth to overcome inequalities with targeted social programs.

When seen through evolution's eyes, conservatives champion efficiency and mass-production of technology while progressives advocate for creativity and diverse perspectives. When isolated, both groups move to their extremes and live too much in their ideological world. However, when brought together, these views complement each other and fulfill the evolutionary need to mass-produce new adaptations to keep life up to date.

Accepting our technological nature is the crucial bridge for these two perspectives. When we insist on technological evolution, both sides need each other and are therefore incentivized to compromise. Instead of attempting to purify our genotypes or phenotypes, we should refine our narratives, belief systems, and ideologies to harness evolutionary laws so we continually create and distribute new tools.

Our new identity will require us to accept the occasional loss of professional and personal identities that technological evolution demands. The abject failures of communism and fascism serve as a stark reminder to cultivate flexibility and adaptability, rather than trying to resist the forces of evolution for individual benefit.

It must be asked, with all the death and conflict caused by attempts to evolve our genotype or phenotype, why was it so difficult for humanity to recognize ourselves as technological beings? The reason is the same as why accepting evolution took so long: it contradicts the paradigms entrenched in our minds. Like all life forms, competing in the game of life is in our nature. And what better strategy for survival than possessing a tool that others lack, or better yet, need?

To illustrate, in the aftermath of fascist and communist atrocities, psychologist Stanley Milgram experimented to understand how ordinary people participated in such events. At Yale in 1961, participants were instructed to act as "teachers" and administer electric shocks to a "learner" (an actor) for errors in a memory test. An authoritative scientist with a clipboard and pencil would insist politely that the experiment continue, even as the learner appeared to suffer increasing pain.

Psychologists were astonished when every "teacher"—despite often feeling agonizing guilt—administered severe shocks, and a full 65 percent of participants activated what they believed were fatal electric shocks. Repeated studies across various groups yielded similar results, revealing a disturbing truth about human behavior: most people can suppress their moral instincts under pressure from perceived legitimate authority.

Perhaps because of my speech impediment, watching these experiments highlighted a simple truth: we should never judge one another's raw capabilities. To me, the Milgram experiment is not primarily about humanity's willingness to follow orders but about our limited awareness, despite having pencils and paper available, no participant considered offering these tools to the "learner" to improve memory. Life has always overcome adversity with adaptations, yet here we were inflicting pain on each other instead of simply providing a pencil. Humans need tools—I would likely need one to communicate my answer without stuttering, just as the scientist used a pencil to record test results.

Yet, even well-intentioned academics often define humanity through narrow identities—genetic, cultural, or social—rather than recognizing that our true power stems from the technologies we use to solve problems. The ideological narratives we construct about superiority—whether based on education, bloodline, race, gender, or class—are misconceptions stemming from technological imbalances.

An ideology-first identity frequently misleads us about our suffering as well, such as "I am poor or hungry because I am a [insert self-identity]." While this identity may explain why other humans target us, the root cause of pain is actually a technological failing. Evolution cannot see our self-identity, but only the adaptations we use to interact with the world, i.e., our tools.

These misconceptions harm those in authority the most, as they often claim biological credit for their tools. Historical examples show that regimes with strong ideological foundations—such as the Confederate States of America, Nazi Germany, and the Soviet Union—were unsustainable in the long term, partly because they promoted genotype-based identities (like racism and sexism) or phenotype-based identities (like classism and elitism) as paths to prosperity, and thereby stopped the creation and distribution of new tools societies need to thrive.

There is no inherent human genotype or phenotype superiority. Our success depends on enhancing capabilities through technology, and like the squirrel and oak tree, we rely on others' technological empowerment to sustain the technological ecosystem we depend on. From Ancient Rome to modern America, successful civilizations have expanded through innovations like roads, libraries, and smartphones. Evolution teaches that individual organisms prosper best when in a ecosystem filled with other healthy individuals.

We should want to give everyone a pencil, purely out of self-interest. We never know who might be the next "black moth" that saves us. After all, once England reduced its industrial soot, the tree bark returned to its pale color, and the rare peppered variant moth ensured the species' survival.

For now, we invent technology but do not naturally distribute it to others. This shortcoming appears in various contexts: workplaces where employees receive tools without choices or input yet are judged on their performance using the tools; schools that test children's knowledge and memory while denying common aids like notes or calculators; and individuals who neglect their own toolsets, hoping instead that an insurance representative will resolve their issues with a claim check.

Withholding technological tools is central to current struggles like the transformation of software from products we own to services we perpetually rent, as well as the "right to repair" and "work from home" movements. These struggles reveal how modern digital technologies—like the printing press in earlier eras—are tools people cannot yet freely control to earn an independent livelihood.

### Opening Our Evolutionary Potential

Fortunately, one group is emerging from the technological landscape: a diverse community of makers, programmers, and designers in the open-source community. They embrace the constant effort and frequent failures that evolution demands. They are too focused on debugging, overcoming errors, and welcoming quality contributions to concern themselves with a person's genotype or phenotype.

Open-source contributors are examples for us all. They evolve solutions to real-life pains. That is why they have created many of your favorite tools, such as Wikipedia, Khan Academy, and the software underpinning the internet. These technologies are worth billions and provided free for anyone to use and adapt. Inspired by their character, this book is open-source distributed via Writebook, another open-source software program based on Ruby on Rails, an amazing technology that powers Basecamp, GitHub, Shopify, and thousands of other products.

However, the open-source community is not perfect. It can be chronically under funded and projects often fragment. Regardless, the community keeps innovating. That's why the future of the Internet Age, as outlined in the "Bumblebee Economics", does not require marches or a revolution. The seeds of this future are already in your hands. You only need to adopt a new identity to realize your potential: a self-aware technological being improving its life through peaceful, gradual technological evolution. This concept required a name, hence the new term "techvolution."

With this new paradigm, you can join the open-source community to develop and disseminate tools that identify the "black moths" in countless niches. Issues like increasing debt, declining health, rising living costs, heightened storm activity, and many others cannot be resolved until the individuals experiencing these physical pains can select the tools to solve them. Open-source technologies are poised to provide customized solutions that are readily available to everyone, "black camouflage" for all, in a manner of speaking.

And we are naturally equipped for this role. Researching this book joyously taught me how to look past ideological identities and connect with the individuals within. Our  innate drive to learn and evolve shines brightly when we define ourselves by the future. So many times I would interview people, most would quickly share their passions for sewing custom clothes, optimizing 3D printers, or creating efficient home gardens. A technological identity is already within us, right beside the music, heroes, and social groups we cherish. These identities need not change as we realize our dreams through technological progress.

However, until humanity intentionally accelerates the technological evolution we depend on, we remain like raccoons suffering through seemingly random restaurant closures and secured waste bins. Our list of problems includes job losses, business failures, psychological disorders, political animosity, civil wars, revolutions, and the cycles of imperial rise and fall. We mistakenly attribute these events to ideology when in reality, they stem from the unnoticed co-evolution, variation, and speciation of technological ecosystems, which occur continuously around us, indifferent to human-constructed identities, borders, and beliefs.

Only a new identity will allow us to glimpse behind the curtain of evolution and learn to harness its powers, as we have already done in physics, chemistry, and medicine. The next step toward self-realization is to ask if we must cooperate like trees and squirrels do—and then, who are we competing against in the game of life?
