TECHVOLUTION
Introducing A New Philosophy To Understand The Human Condition

## What is the book about

In October 1917, several hundred Russians stormed a palace in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Their leader was Vladimir Lenin, who had advocated for a Communist revolution for many years. Finally, his followers were storming one of the homes of Tsar Nicholas II, a person who most of the country still believed was sent from God to rule over Russia. The communist revolutionaries disagreed. They thought religion was a trick, Tsars were corrupt rulers, and now that devoted communists were running things, heaven would soon come to Earth.

Communism is a political and economic philosophy. It has a vision of a better world and a list of instructions for people to follow to make this imagined reality come true. 

Everyone follows a philosophy. It's easier to see how powerful philosophy is when looking at foreign countries and their changeover from one philosophy to the next. Every society will have devoted believers who read philosophy books, debate minute details, and fight if needed. However, even people who don't know philosophy must still live in society and, therefore, must follow the rules and conventions inspired by society's dominant philosophy. Just imagine the identity shift a Russian farmer had when, one day, a divine King was in charge, and then the next day an atheist communist dictator called the shots.

Today, in America and the West at large, our politics is in crisis. Our ideologies, Conservatism and Progressivism, are at each other's throats. Although they share much in common, believers in both camps are forming ranks to fight each other instead of finding ways to compromise. Increasingly, each side dreams of being like the revolutionaries in Saint Petersburg, storming the government office to take power and institute their hallowed ideologies.

There is a reason why Conservatives and Progressives are fighting (and why they will keep fighting), just as there was a reason society followed divine kings and eventually fought for many revolutions to replace those kings. The reason is that human civilization has a story driving it: the story of technological evolution. Sadly, we've always been characters inside this story who don't understand the plot.

So, I wrote Techvolution. This book is about a new political and economic philosophy with a brand new vision for the world. It's custom-made to solve or improve current problems at work, in government, at school, and in society at large. It doesn't need violent revolutions or violence to do this. Instead, it draws back the curtain and explains the story of civilization's technological evolution so we can master it.

Techvolution does all this because it's the first philosophy with an original but rather simple insight. Humanity is not a biological species. We haven't been for many centuries. And with each passing invention, we leave the biological kingdom of Life further behind. Technology is increasing how we gather resources, protect ourselves from the elements, defend ourselves from danger, and many other things.

The book's thesis is that in order to have consistent technological evolution, our society needs a new dominant philosophy that instructs people on how to facilitate technological evolution. I call this new philosophy Techvolution. By embracing technological evolution, we can finally understand the politics and economics and the rules and conventions we need to harness technological evolution. By facilitating evolution, we can finally give everyone a better chance at a happy life.

Sadly, the better world of Techvolution isn't as simple as storming a palace. But you can place one brick on the road to prosperity by reading this book. Once you do, you'll stop being an unaware character inside the story of civilization and instead become a hero of evolution inside it.

Sure, here is a bullet point summary of what your book is about:

## What does this book argue?

This book argues that technological evolution has always been the plot behind civilization. However, we don't realize this truth. Instead, much like how we once thought Earth was the center of the universe or God chose individuals to be divine leaders, we see civilization in a person-centric way. We falsely think civilization will rise and fall based on what ideology we believe in or what our identities are.

We are trapped inside the stories, ideologies, and philosophies of our own creation, be it capitalism, conservatism, socialism, or progressivism. These belief systems help us organize society and give regular people the rules and conventions they need to live daily life. However, ideological storytelling also traps us into believing they are all-powerful and will solve all our problems. And it's never worked out that way.

That's why one day, people will believe their leader was sent from God to rule as an absolute monarch, to a few weeks later, thinking that a communist dictator should rule because he's read the communist manifesto. This constant change of philosophies causes revolutions, counter-revolutions, and general fighting over whose philosophy will rule society. Thus, our civilization's technological evolution advances in fits and jumps and is prone to failure and collapse.

This book argues that ideologies have good and bad features, and we must pick and choose them as required. To have the freedom of mind to mix and match ideologies, we need the power to escape storytelling. We do this the same way we escape the stories that once limited our understanding of physics, astronomy, biology, medicine, and evolution. We escape from our stories by realizing the definition of good and bad is not relative to our stories but to our ability to follow the rules of evolution to foster the technological evolution that is truly driving our civilization forward.

Harnessing technological evolution means understanding what evolution is, how it fights entropy to stay alive, and how we must adapt it to facilitate our ongoing technological evolution. Some of the pillars of evolution we must adapt to our technological evolution are Natural Selection, Ecosystems, Genetic Variation, Adaptation, Speciation, Units of Selection, and Co-evolution.

When past ideologies have proven successful, it's because they happened to champion these pillars. Be it conservatism, which protects property to let it grow in a market economy where the individual is the one selecting what property they need, or progressivism, which recognizes that the government must sometimes re-distribute property so more people will participate in the economy and diversify the kinds of products in an ecosystem.

Finally, this book argues that only by using technological evolution as the benchmark can humans judge the success and failure of their ideologies and beliefs before civilization suffers revolutions or failures. Once we hold ourselves accountable to the rules of evolution, will our civilization evolve smoothly like we often dream in our visions for the future.

--

In summary, here are the key points of Techvolutions' arguments:

1. The book argues that technological evolution, not human-centric ideologies or philosophies, has been the driving force behind the progression of civilization.

2. The book contends that we are trapped within the stories, beliefs, and ideological frameworks of our own creation, which causes constant upheaval and revolutions as competing philosophies vie for dominance.

3. The book proposes that to truly harness and facilitate technological evolution, we need to escape the constraints of ideological storytelling and instead ground our understanding of politics and economics in the fundamental principles of evolution itself.

4. The book argues that by aligning our political, economic, and social frameworks with the "pillars of evolution" like natural selection, adaptation, and co-evolution, we can enable a smoother, more sustainable technological progress that benefits all of society.

Natural Selection: This is the fundamental mechanism of evolution, where individuals with favorable traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on those traits to the next generation. Natural selection acts on the variation present within a population.

Genetic Variation: Evolution requires genetic variation within a population. This variation arises through random mutations, genetic recombination during sexual reproduction, and other processes. Variation provides the raw material for natural selection to act upon.

Adaptation: Organisms evolve adaptations - traits that enhance an individual's ability to survive and reproduce in its environment. Adaptations arise through the process of natural selection favoring beneficial variations.

Speciation: Over time, populations can diverge and form new species through mechanisms like geographic isolation, reproductive isolation, and the accumulation of genetic differences.

Units of Selection: The level at which natural selection acts is debated, but can include the individual organism, the gene, the group, or even the ecosystem. The relative importance of these different units of selection is an active area of research.

Sexual Selection: This is a form of natural selection where certain traits are favored because they increase an individual's reproductive success, often through mate choice (e.g. female choice) or intrasexual competition.

Co-evolution: Species can evolve in response to the evolution of other species, leading to intricate relationships and "arms races" between predators and prey, parasites and hosts, and mutualistic partners.

Evo-Devo: The field of evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) examines how changes in developmental processes can lead to the evolution of new morphological features and body plans.

Our New Leviathan
Opening your eyes to the fact evolution now sees us as a technological species. And that's a big deal.


ESCAPING IDEOLOGY
Unmasking the Storytelling of Our Belief Systems

Across the Western world, the ideological divide between left and right is deepening as each side surrounds itself in a self-reinforcing echo chamber of news, books, and podcasts. The resulting heroization of insiders and vilification of outsiders has driven neighbors, friends, and countrymen to the brink of hatred.

But as people commit to an ideology, few know what an ideology actually is, where does it come from, and why does it wield such power over us. Ideology, this book showcases, is a particular kind of story - one deliberately crafted to compel an entire society to unite and solve problems. But this huge purpose makes ideology hard to escape from. And we need the ability to escape ideologies; because once its founding problems are solved, ideologues do not yet have the self-awarness to move onto new problems and new ideologies.

Once we see through ideology, we begin to see how civilizations have risen and fallen not on the basis of ideological dogma, but on their ability to evolve technological solutions. By freeing ourselves from the constraints of rigid belief systems, we open the door to selectively "mixing and matching" different ideological elements - a pragmatic path to continued problem-solving, and therefore seamless societal and technological evolution.

10 CUPS A DAY
The history of how we drink and how it shows our transition from animal kingdom to technological species.

EVOLUTION'S NEW THIRST
Our Transition From Animal Kingdom To Technological Species.

Cooking food fueled the evolution of human brains, enabling us to create, communicate, and ultimately leave the animal kingdom behind inside civilizations. Yet we are not fully free of our primal roots.

Our belief systems, ideologies, and philosophies are often viewed as the driving forces behind societal success or failure, evidenced by the growing hatred between conservatives and progressives today. But evolution operates by different rules - it cannot comprehend our human languages and belief systems. To truly transcend our animal origins, we must recognize that evolution sees us first and foremost by how we collect and store resources. To evolution we are a technological species.

Tracing how civilizations developed the means to hydrate their populations - from animal skins to indoor plumbing - reveals patterns of ascent and decline mirroring the evolutionary principles governing all life. Only by grounding our politics, economics, and social structures in these fundamental evolutionary dynamics can we hope to navigate a smoother path forward for human civilization.

RECLAIMING THE SUNLIGHT
How the Youth Can Bring Living Costs Down and Save Their Future

Trapped in the shadow of their elders, today's youth face a bleak reality - shut out from stable jobs, retirement savings, and home ownership, the financial sunlight they need to thrive has been denied them. But this crisis is nothing new. Throughout history, many similar cost of living woes have plagued the youth. Usually social upheaval soon follows.

Now, RECLAIMING THE SUNLIGHT offers the younger generation a chance to learn from the past and seize control of their destinies. By examining how previous generations navigated rising cost of living, the book uncovers concrete strategies the youth can employ to not only break free but prosper. The key is to cast aside contemporary deologies and harness modern technology to build a new society that works for them.

Drawing inspiration from the reforms of Julius Caesar to the innovations of early America, the book shows how the youth, by banding together and harnessing innovation, can use 21st century tools to dramatically lower their living costs. In doing so, they'll finally reclaim the sunlight needed to build the prosperous future that has too long been out of reach.

TECHVOLUTION
Introducing A New Philosophy To Understand The Human Condition

Techvolution presents a groundbreaking new philosophy that challenges the dominant ideological frameworks driving politics and economics in modern society. The book argues that technological evolution, not human-centric belief systems has been the true driving force behind the progression of human civilization.

The author contends that we have become trapped within the narratives and stories of our own ideological creation. These belief systems provide the rules and conventions for organizing society, but also lead to constant upheaval as competing philosophies vie for dominance, causing revolutions, counter-revolutions, and societal failures.

To escape this cycle, Techvolution proposes that we must ground our understanding of politics, economics, and social structures in the fundamental principles of evolution itself. By aligning our frameworks with the "pillars of evolution" - concepts like natural selection, adaptation, and co-evolution - the book argues we can harness technological progress in a more sustainable and equitable manner.

The central thesis is that only by using technological evolution as the benchmark, rather than ideological storytelling, can we accurately judge the success or failure of our beliefs and enable a smoother, more stable path of advancement for human civilization. The book challenges readers to rethink the role of ideology and instead focus on the underlying drivers of technological change as the key to shaping a better future.

Techvolution is intended to be of interest to a wide audience, from students of political science, economics, and sociology, to policymakers, business leaders, and anyone concerned with the future trajectory of human society in the face of rapid technological transformation.

Techvolution presents a groundbreaking new philosophy that challenges the dominant ideological frameworks driving politics, economics, and social structures in modern society. The book argues that the deep ideological divides plaguing the Western world are symptomatic of a deeper issue - our tendency to become trapped within the narratives and stories of our own belief systems.

Techvolution contends that ideologies are a particular type of compelling story, deliberately crafted to unite an entire society around solving specific problems. However, once those founding problems are solved, ideologies often struggle to adapt, leading to cycles of upheaval as competing belief systems struggle to stay alive past their lifespans.

To break free from this cycle, the book proposes that we must shift our focus away from human-centric ideologies and instead ground our understanding in the fundamental principles of technological evolution. The author argues that from an evolutionary perspective, we are no longer merely an animal species, but a technological one - our success is defined by how we collect and store resources, not by the specific belief systems we espouse.

By aligning our political, economic, and social frameworks with the core dynamics of technological evolution, such as natural selection, adaptation, and co-evolution, Techvolution suggests we can enable a smoother, more sustainable path of progress. This pragmatic "mixing and matching" of ideological elements, can help us navigate challenges and secure a brighter future.

Particularly relevant for the younger generation, Techvolution offers a roadmap for harnessing modern technology and innovation to dramatically lower living costs and reclaim the financial "sunlight" needed to thrive. By casting aside rigid ideologies and embracing the evolutionary nature of technological progress, the book empowers readers to take control of their destinies.

Techvolution is intended to be of interest to a wide audience, from students of political science, economics, and sociology, to policymakers, business leaders, and anyone concerned with the future trajectory of human civilization in the face of rapid technological transformation.

## Application - The Technological Automatic Nervous System

This one time the phone line crackled with urgency. "Please don't hang up—it has taken me an hour to get through to you." As a claims adjuster, I've heard panic in many voices, but this call was unique. I soon found out this customer was a man standing on a cruise ship somewhere in the Caribbean, desperately trying to save his bed-and-breakfast thousands of miles away in rural Newfoundland. The scene was surreal: as he described his flooding home, the festive sounds of steel drums and laughing retirees drifted through the phone line, a jarring soundtrack to his personal crisis.

In moments like these, the true complexity of our modern lives becomes crystal clear. Here was a business owner, physically separated from his livelihood by an ocean, limited to a ship's telephone as his only lifeline. Every minute mattered—water was seeping through his property, and with each passing hour, the threat of permanent damage increased. His bed-and-breakfast was not just a building; it was his economic foundation, and it was in danger.

The solution we cobbled together was remarkably limited and slow: legal authorization for his brother to act on his behalf, contractors dispatched from a nearby city, and an insurance company coordinating it all from thousands of miles away. It worked, but at considerable cost—both financial, emotional, and time. The longer it took for repairs to start, the more damage entropy did. While we prevented catastrophic damage, the incident highlighted how our current systems, though functional, are far from optimal. It showed us glimpses of a better future—one where our technological ecosystem has its own "nervous system" for rapid response and recovery.

Looking back through history, we can trace how we've evolved in handling such situations. In the 1950s, property problems were only discovered through physical check-ins—imagine returning from vacation to find two weeks' worth of water damage. By the 1980s, at least we had telephones for emergency reporting. The 2000s brought text and email alerts, and today we have smart home monitoring. But we're still just scratching the surface of what's possible.

The future beckons with autonomous property management systems, AI-powered damage assessment, and blockchain-based contractor authorization that could happen in seconds rather than hours. We're moving toward a world where physical distance becomes increasingly irrelevant to property management and crisis response. This evolution isn't just happening in wealthy nations—across the globe, different cultures are adopting and adapting these technologies to their specific needs, creating a universal language of property management that transcends traditional boundaries.

This story illustrates a fundamental truth about our evolving relationship with technology: we are no longer just homeowners or business operators—we are custodians of technological ecosystems. When the primary custodian is unavailable, the system must smoothly transfer responsibility to other qualified custodians. It is a dance of trust, technology, and human expertise that grows more sophisticated with each passing year.

Through the lens of Techvolution, this Caribbean cruise ship crisis reveals something profound about our present and future. The homeowner's struggle wasn't just about distance or communication—it was about a fundamental mismatch between our technological capabilities and our management systems. In our current culture of mass consumption, it's easy to distance ourselves from responsibility, to view problems as someone else's fault—the insurance company's, the pipe manufacturer's, or the plumber's who installed it decades ago.

But Techvolution teaches us that humans are no longer just biological beings but technological ones, with our capabilities, limitations, and very identity defined by the tools we can access and control. In this case, the property owner was essentially depowered—reduced to the capabilities of a basic phone line when the situation demanded much more. This limitation came with real costs: higher insurance premiums, property damage, and lost business revenue—costs that could have been minimized with better technological integration.

Understanding Techvolution helps us see that such problems aren't solved by just adding a few smart devices or better phones. Instead, we need to evolve our entire technological ecosystem. Imagine if the property had been equipped with an integrated "operating system" that included water sensors, automated shutoffs, smart locks, and video monitoring—all connected to a blockchain-based authorization system. In such a system, the owner could have instantly granted access to contractors, insurance adjusters could have assessed damage in real-time through video feeds, and remediation could have begun automatically upon water detection.

More importantly, such a system would encourage proactive responsibility. The homeowner could have easily shut off the water supply before his trip—a simple precaution that's often overlooked. The system could have reminded him, guided him through the process, and verified completion. This isn't about forcing compliance; it's about enabling better technological custodianship.

The key insight of Techvolution here is that we must shift our identity from being mere property owners and customers to being active custodians of our technological environments. Property isn't physically attached to us, and we can hardly create, maintain, and protect all of it ourselves. We need the help of others, and thus must be ready to facilitate how others will contribute to the property's prosperity. The future belongs to those who understand this shift and actively participate in this evolution.

The Caribbean music playing in the background of that call serves as a perfect metaphor: even in moments of crisis, life continues its dance. Our challenge is to build systems that let us handle life's emergencies without missing a beat—systems that transcend cultural boundaries, reduce costs through prevention and efficiency, and enable truly effective technological custodianship. This isn't just about convenience—it's about evolving our very relationship with the physical world through technology.

Although it’s true that the great majority of survival machines are discrete organisms, that doesn’t necessarily have to be the case, and if **genes can influence phenotypes outside the body**, then they will do so. **This is the extended phenotype.** The simplest sort of extended phenotype would be an artifact, like a bird’s nest. So a bird’s nest is an organ. It’s an organ in the same sense as a heart or a kidney is an organ, but it just happens to be outside the body and it happens to be made of grass and sticks rather than being made of the cells that contain the genes. Nevertheless, it’s a phenotype, which is produced by the animal’s nervous system working through nest-building behavior. And it does exactly the same kind of thing—namely, preserve the genes in the form of eggs and chicks, as organs of the body, like kidneys and livers and muscles.

In nature, freedom has a brutal simplicity. Animals are born into a world of constant challenge—hunger, disease, and survival are always just a moment away. Yet even caged animals yearn for something beyond their comfortable confinement, something wild and unregulated.

The wilderness operates on an elegant, uncompromising user interface. Every creature understands its core functions: find food, avoid predators, reproduce. There are no complicated manuals, no customer support lines. The rulebook is written in the fundamental laws of physics, chemistry, and biology—applied equally to every living thing. From the mighty grizzly to the tiny firefly, each organism has a precise role, optimized by millions of years of evolution.

That is not us.

We have traded the savannahs of our ancestors for concrete jungles of cities, technologies, and complex systems. Our user experience is chaotic, filled with bewildering regulations, conflicting instructions, and constant anxiety. Unlike animals who instinctively know how to survive, we navigate a technological wilderness we barely comprehend.

My journey into understanding this complexity began unexpectedly. Struggling with a speech impediment, I took a job as an insurance claims adjuster—essentially a front-row seat to society's most intricate problem-solving theater. The call center became my unorthodox speech therapy, where communication was not just a skill, but a survival mechanism.

Over seven years, I processed over 7,000 claims and spoke with 30,000 people. What I discovered was not just about insurance, but about how little we understand the systems we've created. Insurance companies are technically a "second party" to customers, which means adjusters can ask any question needed to verify a claim. In essence, it was a massive, real-world experiment in human behavior and technological complexity.

The most profound lesson? Everyone is lost most of the time. Race, age, gender—these distinctions dissolve when people encounter a problem they cannot solve. Unlike nature's clear rules, our societal systems are maddeningly inconsistent: regulations change between cities, states, even neighborhoods. Where a bear knows exactly how to find food, we struggle to understand our own furnaces, car maintenance, or insurance policies.

Take Dylan, an elderly gentleman whose SUV caught fire while driving to Florida. After receiving his claim check, he purchased the exact same vehicle model, had the same shop install the same tow hitch, and then called me to ask about the inconclusive engineering report. It was a perfect microcosm of our technological ignorance.

We are like domesticated animals in a complex habitat, navigating without instinct. We use smartphones, computers, and advanced technologies without understanding how they work, how they change us, or how to learn from their failures. Our technological world has become an uncharted wilderness, expanding faster than our ability to comprehend it.

No insurance policy covers this fundamental confusion. But understanding might.

This book is an attempt to map that wilderness—to help us become more than just bewildered passengers in our own technological evolution.

Let's make something that will.

In nature, freedom has a brutal simplicity. Animals are born into a world of constant challenge—hunger, disease, and survival are always just a moment away. A gazelle doesn't consult a manual when a lion approaches; a bird doesn't call tech support to migrate. Yet even caged animals yearn for something beyond their comfortable confinement, something wild and unregulated.

The wilderness operates on an elegant, uncompromising user interface. Every creature understands its core functions with crystal clarity: find food, avoid predators, reproduce. There are no complicated instruction manuals, no customer support lines, no bureaucratic intermediaries. The rulebook is written in the fundamental laws of physics, chemistry, and biology—applied with perfect, impartial precision to every living thing. From the mighty grizzly to the tiny firefly, each organism has a precisely optimized role, refined through millions of years of evolutionary debugging.

Consider a wolf. It knows exactly how to hunt, how to survive winter, how to communicate with its pack. Its entire existence is a seamless interaction with its environment. No wolf has ever looked at another and asked, "Wait, how do I be a wolf again?" Nature's systems are self-documenting, self-maintaining, and brutally efficient.

That is not us.

We have traded the savannahs of our ancestors for concrete jungles of cities, technologies, and increasingly complex systems. Our user experience is chaotic, filled with bewildering regulations, conflicting instructions, and constant low-grade anxiety. Unlike animals who instinctively know how to survive, we navigate a technological wilderness we barely comprehend.

Take any modern technology—a smartphone, for instance. How many people truly understand how it works? Most users know how to tap an icon, scroll through screens, but the underlying technology might as well be magic. We are technological cargo cultists, mimicking behaviors without understanding mechanisms.

My journey into understanding this complexity began unexpectedly. Struggling with a speech impediment that had plagued me since childhood, I took a job as an insurance claims adjuster—essentially a front-row seat to society's most intricate problem-solving theater. The call center became my unorthodox speech therapy, where communication was not just a skill, but a survival mechanism.

Over seven years, I processed over 7,000 claims and spoke with 30,000 people from every conceivable background. What I discovered was not just about insurance, but about how little we understand the systems we've created. Insurance companies are technically a "second party" to customers, which means adjusters can ask any question needed to verify a claim. In essence, it was a massive, real-world experiment in human behavior and technological complexity.

The most profound lesson? Everyone is lost most of the time. Race, age, gender—these distinctions dissolve when people encounter a problem they cannot solve. A wealthy executive becomes just as confused as a blue-collar worker when confronted with a complex insurance claim or a malfunctioning piece of technology.

Unlike nature's clear rules, our societal systems are maddeningly inconsistent: regulations change between cities, states, even neighborhoods. Where a bear knows exactly how to find food, we struggle to understand our own furnaces, car maintenance, or insurance policies. We live in a world of increasing complexity but diminishing comprehension.

Let me illustrate with Dylan, an elderly gentleman whose SUV caught fire while driving to Florida. After receiving his claim check, he purchased the exact same vehicle model, had the same shop install the same tow hitch, and then called me to ask about the inconclusive engineering report. It was a perfect microcosm of our technological ignorance—repeating the same actions, expecting different results, without understanding the underlying systems.

We are like domesticated animals in a complex habitat, navigating without instinct. We use smartphones, computers, and advanced technologies without understanding how they work, how they change us, or how to learn from their failures. Our technological world has become an uncharted wilderness, expanding faster than our ability to comprehend it.

This isn't about individual failure. This is about a systemic challenge. Our educational systems, economic structures, and cultural narratives haven't kept pace with technological evolution. We teach children how to use technologies but rarely how to understand them. We celebrate innovation but rarely interrogate its deeper implications.

No insurance policy covers this fundamental confusion. Traditional risk management breaks down when the systems themselves are poorly understood. We're playing a game where the rules are constantly changing, and most players don't even realize a game is happening.

This book is an attempt to map that wilderness—to help us become more than just bewildered passengers in our own technological evolution. It's about developing a new literacy, a way of understanding how technologies shape us, just as we shape them.

We need a new framework. A way to see our technological ecosystem not as a series of disconnected tools, but as a living, evolving system that we are fundamentally part of.

Let's make something that will help us understand.

### Our Current Understanding Is Not Enough

Biologists call all living things "biomass". The term is most often used to get an idea how many trees, coral, animals, and other living things are in lake, valley, or any large area. Lately, people have started to call artificial creations "technomass", to get an idea how many building, trains, and stuff is out there.

We needed this new term because of the staggering transformation our planet has undergone lately. As recently as 1920, biomass was nearly 99.9% of our world. By 2020, technomass has dramatically risen to approximately 60% and biological life is just 40%. In just one century, we've essentially inverted the natural order, creating a new ecosystem that now weighs more than the combined biological systems of our planet.

Not only do we not understand this new world, we're not supposed to. After the United States and its allies won the Cold War in 1991, the entire world embraced the "invisible hand" of the capitalism's free-market economics. Each country regulates the market different, but even non-democracies learned to use it to build their nations wealth. According to the theory, our individual ignorance of the entire economic system is acceptable, as long as we understood our small role, "the market" of supply and demand will fuel mutual prosperity.

Since then America has experienced a confusing trajectory. While the economy has grown, everyday Americans have not benefitted. Wages have barely kept pace with inflation—median household income increased by only $7,100 over 30 years. Meanwhile, the cost of living has skyrocketed: housing prices have jumped 374%, healthcare premiums have increased 344%, and student debt has grown from 340 billion to $1.7 trillion. Economic mobility has also collapsed, with only half of Americans now able to earn more than their parents, compared to 90% in 1970. These trends paint's a troubling picture of economic stagnation and declining opportunity.

Yet, the other side of the story is a series of successes. Murder rates have declined by 49% from 1980 to 2020. Literacy rates have remained consistently high, with 99% of Americans able to read and write. Infant mortality has improved, falling from 12.6 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1980 to 5.6 in 2020—a 56% decrease. Most dramatically has been the stream of amazing new technologies. Cars now have electric motors and are beginning to drive themselves. A renowned Harvard scientist is working on pill that stops aging. Artificial Intelligence data centers are being built at record speed, as computers seemingly approach the long-discussed "singularity".

Although capitalism is working technological wonders, like my insurance customers, many office workers, farmers, or retirees are left wondering how it works and what comes next. AI might automate your job, your investments could be another Blockbuster, and we're navigating this complex economy with nothing more than blind faith in the "invisible hand".

When Adam Smith invented capitalism in 1776, people made cups from clay and communicated via letters written with bird feathers delivered on horse and wagon. New technology such as eyeglasses and lightning rods was amazing but quite limited and slow coming. The "invisible hand" did not ask for too much adaptability. A apprentice blacksmith or cooper had good reason to believe their skills would always been in need.

But, in modern times with new technologies coming online all the time, we must look behind the magic to see how capitalism creates new technologies. 

This book is about giving you a map drawn by universal rules of this technological evolution so you can see what is now invisible. The journey to sight begins with understanding our own identity. While we define ourselves as black, white, tall, retiree, college student, manager, these are not who we truly are anymore. Technomass is 60% of living stuff. Our first identity must be technological species, that picks and chooses various technology to meet our own unique challenges.

This is not some wacky idealistic theory. Charles Darwin uncovered the rules of evolution in 1859. After years of collecting specimens on voyages and travels, he uncovered the fact that organisms originate from a common ancestor. Nearly all creatures offspring have slight variations, and some variations survive in the environment better than others. Thus new species gradually form as the environment changes. Around the same time Gregor Mendel discovered the way in which beings inherent their parents variations via genes; "packets of information" he called them. Scientists today call genes the "genotype" of a lifeform and the way in which creatures grows its "phenotype".

Imagine two acorns from the same oak tree with nearly identical genes, but planted in very different environments. One grows in a crowded forest, the other acron falls down a cliff and lands into a windy plain. The forest acorn becomes tall and thin, stretching upward to compete for sunlight. The plain acorn grows shorter and wider, with broader and bushy branches. Despite having the same genetic blueprint, their environments shape them differently. Over time, the children acorns that best adapt to their specific environment—whether forest or plain—will have the best chance of survival, gradually creating distinct species of the original tree.

Beyond the genotype and phenotye living things create tools and structures that extend their biological capabilities. A bird's nest is a perfect example. Just like an internal organ protects and supports life, a nest serves the same purpose—but it's built outside the bird's body using materials like grass and sticks. The bird's brain designs and builds this nest, which shelters its eggs and chicks, effectively functioning as an external organ that helps preserve the bird's genetic legacy. It's a way of extending the organism's survival strategy beyond its physical form. Scientist call things like bird's nests, ant colonies, and wolf dens the "extended phenotype" of a creature.

After centuries of study, humanity understand our genes with fields like genetics and molecular biology specializing in it. Our phenotype is studied in antropology and sociology. But we do not have a field of study to understand our extended phenotype, our technology.

While tools have always been vital to civilization, it's only since the end of Industrial Revolution in 1969 that we've become overwhelmingly dependent on artificially created materials and power sources. From smartphones delivering our food to satellites guiding our travel, we live and die by the technology we hold. Just as fish have gills and birds have wings, we now have computers and machines. Just as animals have calories to fuel their bodies, we have electricity to fuel our technological adaptations.

After Darwin and Mendel made their huge discoveries, we spent decades decoding the rules of biological evolution. This book applies those lessons to our technological world. Imagine the transformative potential if we could truly understand how markets and technologies evolve by applyng the same principles governing biological life. This book is our first step on a long journey to comprehend how this technological ecosystem operates.

Before we do, we must accept why why it's been so hard for us to study our extended phenotype.

### Our Biggest Hurdle Is In Our Head

Just as a wolf evolves an extraordinary sense of smell to track prey, or a bird's beak adapts to access specific food sources, our technologies evolve to solve increasingly complex human challenges. Consider the smartphone: its ancestors were bulky, limited devices that have transformed into sophisticated tools of connectivity and computation.

During my years as a claims adjuster, I witnessed this technological co-evolution firsthand. Nearly everyone carried a smartphone, a testament to how we're not just buying technology, but fundamentally changing our capabilities. But was this new technological creature truly free to evolve?

My journey into understanding our relationship with technology began unexpectedly during my university years, triggered by a documentary about the infamous Milgram Experiment.

In 1961, Yale psychologist Stanley Milgram conducted a groundbreaking experiment to understand human behavior under authority. Participants believed they were helping research how pain influences learning. A "teacher" would administer increasingly powerful electric shocks to a "learner" for each mistake, with an authoritative scientist encouraging continuation despite the learner's apparent suffering.

The results were shocking. While psychologists predicted only 1-3% would administer the final, potentially lethal shock, 65% of participants did so. The experiment revealed a disturbing truth: most individuals can override their moral code when pressured by perceived legitimate authority.

But I was struck by something different. No one offered the "learner" a pencil—a simple tool that could have changed everything. We invented writing precisely because we are not perfect memory machines. Yet we continue to judge human potential based on inherent capabilities rather than recognizing the transformative power of technological tools.

My own speech impediment made this insight deeply personal. Why would we judge someone's capabilities without considering the technologies that could empower them? My classmates would dismiss my observation, but I saw something profound: technology is not just a tool, but a lever of human potential.

We fail to recognize that holding a piece of technology grants power—not through genetic or ideological superiority, but by extending human capabilities beyond our biological baseline. This insight reframes much of human history.

The phrase "Men are born free, and everywhere they are in chains" from Rousseau's _The Social Contract_ takes on new meaning when viewed through a technological lens. Rousseau argued that legitimate political authority emerges from the people's collective will. Today, we can extend that concept to technological democratization.

Our political ideologies have traditionally been trapped between two evolutionary perspectives: the right-wing emphasis on genetic determinism and the left-wing focus on environmental influence. My work suggests we need a third perspective: technology as a critical component of human evolution.

Consider how technological access has always been a form of power. In _Tarzan of the Apes_, the protagonist's "noble blood" is used to explain his sophistication, when in reality, it was exclusive access to education, tools, and resources that truly differentiated him.

During my time as a claims adjuster, I witnessed how technological inequality plays out in real life. When my colleagues and I attempted to create an open-source solution to streamline the claims process, we encountered resistance that mirrored historical patterns of technological gatekeeping.

The American founders understood this intrinsically. They enshrined technological freedom in the First and Second Amendments, recognizing that access to tools is fundamental to human potential. This perspective helped America become a global technological leader.

Our challenge now is to see technology not as an external force, but as an integral part of human adaptation and survival. We must break the chains of poor user experience by making the invisible visible.

By reconsidering our relationship with technological systems, we open the possibility of a transformative exploration. We're not just users of technology; we're co-evolving with it. Our soul—and potentially life on Earth—depends on understanding this profound symbiosis.

The game has changed. Are you ready to play?

The first section of the Introduction contrasts the natural world's straightforward survival mechanisms with humanity's complex technological environment, using the author's personal experience as a claims adjuster as a narrative lens. Through vivid comparisons between animal instincts and human technological navigation, the section argues that while animals have clear, intuitive ways of surviving in nature, humans struggle to comprehend the technological systems they have created. The author illustrates this disconnect by highlighting how people from all walks of life become equally lost when confronted with technological challenges, suggesting that our societal systems, educational approaches, and cultural narratives have failed to keep pace with rapid technological evolution. Ultimately, the section sets up a provocative premise: we do not understand how to live in the increasingly technical world we have built, and this systemic misunderstanding affects everyone, regardless of social status or background.


The second section of the Introduction explores the dramatic transformation of our world from a predominantly biological system to a technological one, highlighting the shift from 99.9% biomass in 1920 to 60% technomass by 2020. Using economic and technological developments as a backdrop, the section critiques the limitations of traditional capitalist models and the "invisible hand" theory, demonstrating how technological evolution has outpaced our understanding. By drawing parallels between biological evolution (using Darwin and Mendel's work) and technological development, the author introduces the concept of an "extended phenotype" and proposes a new framework of understanding human identity as a "technological species". The section argues that while we have sophisticated methods of studying biological evolution, we lack a comprehensive approach to understanding technological evolution, setting up the book's central mission: to decode the rules of technological adaptation and transformation.


Ultimately, the thesis is provocative yet apparent: we do not understand how to live in the increasingly technical world we have built, and this systemic misunderstanding affects everyone, regardless of social status or background. Technology is our "extended phenotype", and its grown immensely over the last 100 years. Once we acknowledge we are now predominately a species living in a technological environment, we can tools to alleviate any issues with our genes or phenotype, and thus become increasingly a "technological species" because we evolve solutions to our problems using tools instead of biology. However, while we have sophisticated methods to study biological evolution, we lack a comprehensive approach to understanding technological evolution, setting up the book's central mission: to decode the rules of technological adaptation and transformation.


Ultimately, the thesis is provocative yet apparent: we do not understand how to live in the increasingly technical world we have built, and this systemic misunderstanding affects everyone, regardless of social status or background. Technology is our "extended phenotype", and its grown immensely over the last 100 years, making Earth a predominately technological environment. However, while we have sophisticated methods to study biological evolution, we lack a comprehensive approach to understanding technological evolution, setting up the book's central mission: to decode the rules of technological adaptation and transformation.

Before we can do these wonderful things, we must first accept we are a species living in a technological environment, who can evolves solutions to our problems—whether environmental, genes or phenotype—using tools. Thus we are increasingly a "technological species" who only prospered by being a member of an economy that protects individuals creating, spreading, and using any tools needed to solve a real-life problem.



Our political ideologies have traditionally been trapped in a narrow view of human potential. The right-wing perspective tends to emphasize genetic determinism, seeing technological adaptation as an extension of inherent biological capabilities. Conversely, the left-wing focus on environmental influence views technology as a tool for social equalization, but often fails to recognize technology's transformative power beyond social structures.

Both perspectives miss a crucial insight: technology is not just a tool or a social leveler, but a fundamental mechanism of human evolution. The right reduces technological innovation to individual genius, while the left sees it primarily as a means of redistributing power. In reality, technology is our collective adaptive strategy—a way we extend our capabilities beyond biological and social limitations.

This myopic view creates a dangerous blind spot. By framing technology through outdated ideological lenses, we limit our understanding of how technological evolution actually works. We treat technology as something external to human experience, rather than recognizing it as an integral part of our species' adaptive mechanism.

The result is a fragmented approach to technological development. We debate who should have access to technology, rather than understanding how technology fundamentally reshapes human potential. We argue about the origins of innovation—whether through individual brilliance or collective effort—instead of comprehending technology as a dynamic, ecosystem-wide process of adaptation and transformation.

This was a time of great discovery in physics, chemistry, geology, and mathematics, each field helping the other continue making newsworthy advancements. As Nature was seemingly revealing all of its secrets, other areas of human understanding wanted to join the party.

This was sadly literal. As humanity saw itself as a genotype or phenotype, these two components of our existence was used to describe human history and future. Thus, eugenics and social engineering came to dominate society. The first was a horrid practice of identifying supposed problematic people's and assigning their genes to be unworthy of reproduction, and either casting them into camps, sterilizing them, or murdering them, all in the name of evolution by mass society who joined political movements and parties.

The social engineering was equaling horrifying. Rather than judge a person's genes, this ideology judged a person's upbringing. Once tainted with the life experience of wealth and privilege, a person is no longer fit to live in a world destined to make all lifeforms equal. Millions died in purges and famines as a result. 

Both movements were extreme to no ends. Besides their inherent evil, scientists had weird ideas such that head sizes and shape determined intelligence, while other scientists flat out refused to acknowledge genes exist and insists grain seeds are all equal if treated the same (hence the famines when summer grain was planted in cold climates). These ideologues are extreme but not far off. The people who believed them were just as you and I.

We even have their remains in our society today, the ongoing "nature versus nurture" debate between Conservative and Progressive politics is nothing but a more humane version of the genotype vs phenotype debate evolution often plays. However, as growing tensions between the political left and right showcase, there is no resolution to this debate because it simply does not apply to use. We are not primarily either. We are the raccoon, living a life using technology with out the self-awareness to see it.

Here's an example.

I'll give an example using the famous Milgram Experiment.

In 1961, Yale psychologist Stanley Milgram conducted an experiment to understand how people committed the atrocities of World War II. Participants were told to administer increasingly powerful electric shocks to a "learner" (an actor) for memory test mistakes. An authoritative scientist (another actor) in a lab coat would insist the experiment must continue, even as the learner screamed in apparent pain.

Shockingly, 65% of participants administered what they believed to be a potentially fatal shock, despite personal discomfort. Repeated studies consistently showed similar results across different demographics. The experiment revealed a disturbing truth: most people can override their moral instincts when pressured by a perceived legitimate authority.

When I learned this at university, I was especially abhorred for another reason. No teacher ever offered the learner a pencil. The entire experiment is a pretense that we humans are memory machines. We invented writing thousands of years ago specifically because we are not memory machines. Yet we still evidently don't mind judging others as being supposed failures—whether because of "bad" genes or upbringing—when the truth is we just need a simple pencil to prosper.

Perhaps it’s because of my aforementioned speech impediment, but I found this absolutely the worst thing ever. Why would anyone judge another person, while not seeking to empower them?

My classmates would scoff "that's not what the test is about", which I would respond with indignation "then why does the scientist use a pencil to mark down his notes. And why is the teacher reading the test words instead of having them memorized? This is a story about two people with technology bullying someone without it, that's all."

We don't recognize holding an important piece of technology is a lever of power that makes a person an authority, not because of any genetic or ideological superiority, but simply because they've enhanced their capabilities beyond the baseline of human genotype or phenotype. Eyeglasses, calculators, prosthetics, nutritional supplements, the list of technologies that empower is today endless and should keep going. Yet, we are not self-aware enough to see how technology augments us to being new kinds of beings.
