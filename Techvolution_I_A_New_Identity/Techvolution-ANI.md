## Book I: A New Identity

- we think we create new technology. the realization that makes our present and future make more sense is that at some point technology started to create us.

- see our lives/jobs not as bro vs fighting over tech to advance their genes but as on independent (tech) ecosystem that we harness/car for, like a farmer from foraging to farming.

-  identity shift as genetic shift!

- Take a moment to list three tools you rely on daily. For each, ask: How did this tool change the way I solve a problem? What would happen if I lost it tomorrow? Which new tool could replace or augment it tomorrow?”

- why does evolution favor bigger organism, until a high pressure/extinction event?

## Back Page Summary

Who are you? What truly defines your identity in this age of massive technological change?

Techvolution is a new framework that helps us understand ourselves, our society, and our rapidly changing world.

We need guidance understanding this transformation. From smartphones that connect us globally to medical devices that extend our lifespans, new technologies have become so pervasive that they are now permanent extensions of our biological selves, profoundly transforming how we live, work, and interact. In the eyes of evolution, we are becoming something unprecedented—"technological beings," chosen not for our genetics or life experiences, but by our ability to create and harness tools.

As we embrace our technological identity, we begin to see how the principles of evolution—adaptation, selection, and speciation—now govern our societies, political systems, and economies. Accepting evolution's control over us is a new paradigm that empowers us to:

- Understand human history through technological evolution
- Embrace new technologies instead of fearing the loss of our jobs
- Lower living costs with faster adoption of innovations
- Transform ideological divisions into technological collaboration

Whether you are a business owner, policymaker, or someone seeking deeper insight into the human condition, _Techvolution_ is an essential new framework for understanding our rapidly changing world. With this new paradigm, you will emerge with a profound new perspective on your place in history and the extraordinary future that awaits us as self-aware technological beings.

## Inner Flap

For centuries, humanity has defined itself through ideologies: belief systems and cultural narratives that shape our worldview. But what if, in fact, these identities have obscured the true driver of our advancement?

In _Techvolution_, you will confront this provocative question as you discover that our technological evolution, not our ideological beliefs, holds the key to understanding human civilization and your place within it. Consider how forging steel revolutionized society or how AI currently challenges our notion of human uniqueness. New technology does not just change our products—it changes who we are.

What truly distinguishes our species from other life forms is not language or culture, but our continual creation of new tools. This technological evolution defines our fate more fundamentally than gender, ethnicity, or nationality ever could. Just as natural selection shapes biological life, technological evolution determines our species’ future.

With this insight, we can base our identity, politics, and economics on evolution's fundamental principles. By aligning our beliefs with these natural mechanisms, we can unlock many practical benefits: reduced living costs through faster technology adoption, collaborative solutions to climate challenges, and fostering innovation that autonomously heals human pain.

Technology is a new branch on the tree of life. Just as the study of evolution illuminated the natural world, the study of technological evolution will reveal the intricacies of our technological life.

Spanning the breath of human history, _Techvolution_ reframes the human story by placing our technological nature at its center. For those seeking to understand our rapidly changing times, this book provides more than just insight—it offers an intellectual blueprint for the extraordinary future we are building together as a technological species.

## Dedication

_This book is for the open-source community—for the collaborative mindset you handed down to me while updating Wikipedia, writing free software, and answering endless questions on Stack Overflow. You showed a philosophy student what the future could be as you became the protagonists of the Internet Age. Still, while you create many innovative frameworks and side projects, the world urgently needs you to use this book and others to construct the Internet Age economy, build step by build step, posthaste._

_This book is especially dedicated to the middle class. Our society's stubborn loyalty to the Industrial Age way of life has stagnated our economy and poisoned our political discourse. I pray you embrace the evolutionary changes necessary and reach for the Internet Age future that open-source heroes have made available for us, while we still can._

## Book Series

_Techvolution: On the Origin of Technological Species_ presents a new way of understanding human civilization. It showcases how the human story is driven not by our beliefs or ideologies, but by the technologies we create and use. The journey from recognizing our technological nature to building a better world happens as we transform three interconnected realms: individual identity, political discourse, and economic systems.

**Book I—A New Identity:** This foundational work introduces a "technological identity"—the idea that we humans are best understood through the tools and technologies we use to house ourselves, earn a living, and in general, interact with the world. While we have names for our nationality, ethnicity, employment, and politics, we lack consciousness of our technological nature.

Consider someone labeled "Californian, female, Hispanic, college graduate, progressive, regional manager"—yet none of these captures what matters most to her: it is 2011, high-speed internet is finally widespread, and she sells DVDs for a living. Because technological evolution is about to make physical media discs obsolete, her personal networks and knowledge base are now of questionable value. Yet, we have no name for this identity that might upend her life. This is but one example of why, from power tools to smartphones, our technological choices not only shape what we can do but who we should see in the mirror so we stop using biological instincts to live in a technological ecosystem.

**Book II—Mixed Ideological Politics:** Having established our technological identity, we must next liberate our toolsets from ideological constraints. Today, we often reject useful tools simply because of their political or cultural associations—renewable energy is labeled "green," diesel trucks "red-blooded American." These artificial divisions prevent us from combining technologies in optimal ways.

Mixed Ideological Politics teaches how to evaluate tools based purely on their effectiveness in solving our real-life problems, from the cost of home heating to increased storm activity. This new political philosophy prevents any ideology from blinding us to any worthy technology. In essence, this book is about learning political moderation in the modern age.

**Book III—Bumblebee Economics:** Once we combine technological self-awareness with ideology-free tool selection, we can create an economy as adaptive as life itself. Nature shows us the way. Her diverse biological species create collaborative ecosystems through simple rules of interaction. Bumblebee Economics applies this wisdom to our technological world. While we have already developed some open-source and interoperable technologies like USB and Bluetooth, we need an economic philosophy that accelerates their use to create a freely evolving technological ecosystem.

The goal is to create an ecosystem similar to Apple's, but more decentralized and dynamic: imagine medical records seamlessly flowing between a doctor's office, pharmacy, and your smartphone. All this via independent, yet standardized, programs that can evolve independently. Like bees and flowers co-evolving in a symbiotic relationship, this framework would enable technologies to adapt and grow, with users benefiting from increasingly capable and interconnected systems. With this approach, we can finally move on from the Industrial Age's mass-production mindset and embrace the era of mass collaboration in the Internet Age.

`Understand yourself → Learn to use different tools → Work effectively with others`

<!-- "The term "ideo" in "ideological" comes from the Greek word "idea", which means "form", "thought", or "concept". In the context of ideology, it refers to a system of ideas, beliefs, or values that shape an individual's or group's perspective on the world.

In essence, the "ideo" part of the word "ideological" suggests a connection to ideas, theories, or doctrines that guide one's thinking, behavior, or actions. An ideology is a comprehensive and coherent set of ideas that provide a framework for understanding and interpreting reality, often influencing one's attitudes, opinions, and decisions.

The term "ideology" was first coined by French philosopher Antoine Destutt de Tracy in the late 18th century, and it has since been used to describe a wide range of philosophical, political, and social systems of thought." -->

## Foreword

### Discovery

On August 24th, year 79, Mount Vesuvius erupted. The volcano pushed ash clouds miles into the sky. Soon scorching debris was falling for miles around like snow during a fierce Siberian blizzard. Thereafter, Italian towns Pompeii and Herculaneum were frozen in a single, catastrophic moment. A snapshot of Roman life was preserved under endless ash—everything from bread in ovens to human expressions of terror, from artistic frescoes to fragile scrolls.

Yet this moment of destruction was just another period of profound loss. Even with all the many ruins we can visit today, most of everything from the ancient world is gone. For example, historians estimate that over 99% of ancient literature was lost to time—burned, destroyed, disintegrated, or simply forgotten. Entire libraries, generations of human knowledge, vanished like the smoke of Mount Vesuvius. The Library of Alexandria, with its hundreds of thousands of scrolls, would become the most famous casualty of this sad intellectual loss.

But some fragments survived, often in garbage dumps, old churches, or disaster sites like Pompeii and Herculaneum.

Covered by ash, the scrolls from Pompeii and Herculaneum were far too fragile to ever be opened. So we did not open them. They were collected and stored. It was left to our imaginations to dream of the knowledge that was locked inside.

Until, like the microscope let us see unknown tiny worlds, modern CT scanners could finally peer inside the ash scrolls, and machine learning algorithms could decode the information the scans uncovered. Now, after nearly 2000 years, we could finally read this time capsule of information.

Even so, Dr. Elena Stavros hadn't expected much when she ran the first fragment through the advanced CT scan. After endless hours in her lab she kept thinking "Another piece of ancient debris is another dead end". But something in one of the algorithmic reconstructions dazzled her eye.

Lines of text emerged. The machine learning model peeled back layers of carbon and time, revealing Greek characters that seemed to shimmer like fairy dust on her computer monitor.

"It's not just text," she whispered to her research team. "It's a new dialogue!"

The manuscript was from Magos of Samos—a name barely mentioned in historical records. We only know he, or she, was a student of Aristotle whose work had been lost to time. But here, preserved in the volcanic tomb of Pompeii was a text fragment.

A text fragment written not just to the future, but about the future.

The AI had done more than decode text. It had resurrected a voice that had been waiting nearly two millennia to be heard. Magos' words, preserved by volcanic fire, decoded by machine intelligence, were a lost story of Socrates learning a vital lesson that was remarkably prescient today.

Only fragments have been uncovered thus far, so the author filled in some gaps. It proved to be the best foreword the author and reader could ask for.

### Short Story Dialogue

The salt air carried the scent of tar and sweat thick through the crowd. The great Athenian harbor of Piraeus churned with activity—merchants shouting prices in a dozen dialects, slaves hauling amphorae of oil and wine, sailors mending nets with practiced hands.

A bronze-tipped spear split its way through the crowd. He stopped, breathed in and looked around. This display of commerce, engineering, civil law makes the soldier stop and smirk.

Now the people walking by patting him on the shoulder. A sign of respect.

This is why Athens was the jewel and central power of the Hellenic world. Not just for the commerce that made her rich, or the engineers that made her powerful, but for the democracy that made them united.

And Socrates was one of her citizens. Nearing middle aged but in good health. His balding head and stubby nose made him rather ordinary in appearance, if it weren't for the hoplite armour he half wore and carried with him. Bronze shield and helmet, hardened spear, sword, and leather armour.

As people's hands keep patting his shoulders.

"Give those Spartans Athenian metal!" A teenager cries out to the soldier. "Hip hip horray!" responds the crowd.

Socrates can't help but smile as he continues walking through the crowd. He sees a stump near a pier and walks over as the cheers die down. 

A better place to observe the organized chaos of it all. Holding his helmet, he feels at its weather leather straps and worn paint, and reflects at the chaos of the people, and thinks they are like ants on so many ant hills.

Of course better than ants he thinks. The Pythagoras school teaches the laws of geometry, workers use them to build the walls, lay the ships, grind the corn, and build the armor.

Socrates is awoken from his reflection by a crash of wood on stone. A Phoenician vessel eases into berth, its wood hull scarred by countless voyages. The crew moves with an efficiency born of necessity—like ants he thought again—each man knowing his role without instruction.

Not ants of course. Because each man must learn their place. But how?

Education of course. That thought makes him mourn. He long wanted to teach students, as his friends are wont to say, he is plagued by questions. Not the sort his fellow citizens asked about grain prices or political alliances, but deeper puzzles about justice, virtue, the nature of a good life.

The war horn sounds again from the Acropolis. Soldiers are being called to their ships. Socrates wandered off from the mustering grounds, he told himself he needed to be reminded one more time why he fights.

Socrates holds his gear one more time. Inherited from his father, he will live or die inside this gear, maybe against Spartans with a undying reputation for being the masters of warfare with the hardest of shields and the sharpest of spears. He does not want to die, but is sad that his unanswered philosophical questions will die with him.

Just then a strange sound catches his attention—a cacophony unlike anything he'd heard before.

The strange vessel moves with deliberate care toward an empty berth, its crew working in hushed concentration. Socrates has seen ships from across the Mediterranean—Egyptian grain haulers, Phoenician traders, even the occasional barbarian craft from beyond the Pillars of Heracles—but this one puzzles him. It has Athenian colors, and design but is weathered and filled with many cages covered with leathers and tarps.

What truly catches his attention, however, are the sounds.

A cacophony of chirping, chattering, and calls unlike anything heard in an Athenian market before. These many creatures were seemingly all still alive.

Not unusual for a ship. Ships often bring animals for trade and sale. But usually large lions, giraffes, and other beasts.

As the ship draws closer, Socrates could see these creatures are in wooden cages stacked along the deck. As the leather tarps are removed, he sees the diversity. Birds with brilliant plumage that seem to shift color in the sunlight, furry creatures of some sort, lizards of impossible variety.

"By Zeus," muttered an old fisherman beside Socrates, "what manner of voyage brings back a floating menagerie?" The fisherman taps Socrates spear as he walks away too busy with his job to care anymore on the matter.

As the gangplank lowers, a figure emerges that commands immediate attention. He is perhaps thirty years of age, with the weathered look of a man who had spent months under foreign suns, yet his eyes hold an intensity that reminds Socrates of the philosophers who gathered in the agora.

Behind him comes his crew, carefully carrying the cages with a reverence usually reserved for sacred objects. The man supervises each movement, occasionally making notes on a wax tablet, his attention shifting between his precious cargo and detailed sketches that flutter in the sea breeze.

"Careful with the labels of each cage," he calls to a sailor. "Each variety tells a story!"

Stories? Socrates walks closer to investigate. What stories could animals tell? The philosopher in him stirred with familiar hunger. These were no ants, but a puzzle. One last one before his battle.

The man steps fully onto the dock. "Nikias! Arrange the bird specimens by island of origin," he calls to a young sailor struggling with a cage of peculiar finches. "The ones from the eastern archipelago here, the western group there. Mind the labels."

"Again with the labels! Did you not write your records already?"

"The labels!"

Socrates watches, fascinated, as the crew begins organizing the menagerie with methodical precision. The man—clearly the expedition's leader—consults his notes constantly, directing the placement of each cage with the care of a priest arranging sacred offerings.

"These tortoises," the man says, pointing to several large shells that housed creatures with different neck lengths.

Another sailor holds up a cage containing what appears to be the same type of small, dark bird. "Where do these go, Zographos?"

The man, Zographos, helps the sailors move the crates off. He returns to arranging his wax tablets, sheets of papyrus, and scrolls.

The war horn rings twice. Socrates doesn't acknowledge it this time. Instead he approaches Zographos.

"Friend," Socrates begins. "I am Socrates, son of Sophroniscus. Welcome home. Pray tell, where did you return from with such a wondrous variety of cargo."

"Hello Friend, I can see the rumours of war were not exaggerated. I pray for your safety and for the Spartans to come to his senses."

"I thank you for the well wishes. But I must note that you fail to answer the query."

"Friend, I respect the protection you do for our city. But to tell you where I've been and what we've seen is by no means for conversation here at the dock. Pythagoras needed education and students for his work, and I will too."

"More curious words I cannot remember hearing. But forgive me, some may not be here to read your scrolls or seat in your academy." This incites the response Socrates wanted.

"Zographos of Athens," says, as he gives Socrates his hand. "I have returned from the Blessed Isles, far beyond the western horizon—islands that Homer never even sang of, where the very foundations of life reveal their secrets. Please ask your questions, I can see the new triremes fleet is embarking even as we speak. Finer ships cannot be found anywhere on the seas. They will put you on trial Socrates if you desert, so be quick of questions and comprehension."

Socrates feels his pulse quicken.

"Why group them by shell shape and cages?"...

"Because Socrates, the Gods are craftsman with a hammer and the environment is the anvil!"

Socrates draws his weather gear aside to move closer to this weathered traveler and his extraordinary cargo. Something in the man's precise movements and intense gaze suggested a mind as restless as his own.

"Indulge a soldier. Please continue."

"You surely know Herodotus of Halicarnassus and his tale of The Egyptian king Necho II."

"They sailed around Arabia."

"We set out to show the way again. Surely the trade routes would be grant Athens riches worthy of the task... And instead we found blessed islands."

"The Blessed Isles?" Socrates gestures toward the cages. "And these creatures—why capture them? For trade, for sacrifice?"

"May the Gods strike me down for the thought."

Zographos pauses for a minute. He's preparing to say his deepest thoughts.

"These animals are teachers, Socrates. Each one holds a lesson. You see, the winds wouldn't let us go south. They brought us to these islands in the middle of the ocean with nothing but volcanoes at their tips, and forests, ponds, streams, and in small patches throughout their lonely rocks."

"We tried every route south. Going from island to island looking. Soon we needed supplies of course, so we went back again and again. No cities. No temples. No men. All the better, it turns out. For I finally saw how different each island was".

"And then I noticed how the creatures—birds, lizards, tortoises—each looked the same, but different, just enough to survive."

"The creatures morphed like the gods."

As Socrates leans forward, his eyes bright with intellectual hunger, Zographos feels a rush of uncertainty, a concentrated dose of what has accompanied him through years of observation and discovery.

Here, on this bustling dock with war approaching, he might finally give voice to the revolutionary thoughts that have consumed him. After years of travel with only his thoughts, scrolls, creatures and sailors. Here is a person. He told himself he needed isolation to write his book. But really, he's been nervous to speak of his ideas.

What if he's wrong? Worse, what if no one believes him.

He tells himself someone had to be first to hear it, why not a soldier who is leaving the city for months if not years. Zographos then finds the courage to look at this man, Socrates.

Who looks back with the thrill of approaching understanding. "Go on. Changed how?"

Zographos sets down his wax tablet. Would this Socrates be his first student?

What nerves this thought has.

"You ask the right question, my friend!" Zographos says, embracing this chance. His words tumbling out with the enthusiasm of a man who has been alone with revolutionary thoughts for too long. "Watch." Zographos lifted a cage with a small finch. "This bird came from a land with only hard seeds. Now look—" He lifts another finch. "but this one lived where only soft insects were available. Its beak became slender and precise."

"You're saying the islands..."

"Each island shaped them differently," Zographos continues, now just speaking his thoughts, his shoulders drop and tension falls, this feels liberating. "The same ancestor, but each population adapted! That's the book! The dry islands demanded one solution, the wet islands another."

With poised vigour he continues "And the Gods selected the ones who were to breed on." 

Socrates stares at the birds, his mind racing. "And you believe this principle applies to island creatures?"

Zographos' eyes gleam. "My friend, I believe this principle explains all creatures."

Socrates strokes his weather leather straps, and grips his spear, then nods to encourage Zographos to continue.

"You care for me to continue. You are interested?"

"It's nice to meet someone who has been away for many years. I think it is fair to say I have a reputation for curiosity, as I am sure you will find out. I perhaps have enough to make a difference to our fair city's future."

Zographos looks directly at Socrates, his voice dropping to an almost reverent whisper. "The whole process—the inheritance, the variation, the selection, the branching into new forms to cast away the unneeded old—I call it evolution."

Socrates feels something shift deep within his mind, like a key turning in a lock he hadn't known existed. The questions that had plagued him about justice, virtue, and human nature suddenly reorganize themselves around this single, powerful idea. If humans, like these creatures, were shaped by the challenges they faced...

The horn blows thrice.

Socrates holds his spear, and old armour, and leans in and says with a smile, "Tell me more about evolution, I think we shall put it to use before long".

Zographos hesitated, knowing the complexity of life that he had witnessed. "It will take generations," he said, "to truly understand what these islands have revealed."

Socrates smiled, holding his weathered spear. "When I return we will get started," he responded, "and set the foundations for our ancestors to complete the job when their time comes."

### Explainer

Sadly, there was no Magos of Samos. There are plenty of scrolls found at Pompeii and Herculaneum. Scientists are just now starting to use CT scanners and machine learning to unlock their contents. So far, there are no lost ancient works found.

Alas, the scene you just read is a fictional thought experiment—a glimpse into an alternate history where two of humanity's most transformative intellectual revolutions occurred simultaneously.

I used it to teach a vital lesson.

First however, we must realize why Socrates (470–399 BC) is so important. He was, as the Roman philosopher Cicero observed, the first to "call philosophy down from heaven, place it in cities and homes, and compel it to inquire about life and morals as well as good things and bad." Before him, the common practice was to let professional debaters, known as Sophists, battle over a question. Everyone assumed justice had no universal definition and was merely a matter of law, custom, or power. Sophists used rhetoric to convince people that their side served the ruler's interests and was therefore just.

Socrates challenged this mindset. Instead of accepting that justice was relative to human laws or customs, he asked things like “What is justice?” or "What is ethics".

Such deceptively simple questions were in line with ancient Greek natural philosophers such as Thales, Anaximander, and Pythagoras. These thinkers discovered natural laws of geometry, mathematics, and observation that helped craftsmen and engineers to calculate volume, weight, and angles more precisely, thereby empowering Greek civilization to build increasingly sophisticated sewers, ships, buildings, and countless other wonders.

Socrates asked why wouldn't human society also be subject to universal laws if water, ships, and engineering are?

Socrates, and his best student Plato (427-347 BC), thus turned philosophy towards the human condition with practical questions about how we should live, what constitutes justice, and how societies should be organized. Socrates taught his students to ask these questions, in what we now call the Socratic method, in order to use philosophy to build a better person and society the same way engineers use mathematicians to build better buildings.

Plato wrote these lessons down, adding his own thoughts along the way, in books called Socratic dialogues. By forever studying these works, every subsequent development in Western philosophy, politics, and ethics is rooted in this Socratic revolution.

Charles Darwin (Zographos), over two millennia later, revealed the mechanism by which all life adapts and evolves. Although many scientists laid the groundwork for Darwin, their contribution was often removing the buildup of erroneous human narratives, such as all animals being created as they exist today and the Earth only being a few thousand years old.

While it was never going to be easy, Darwin's insights into natural selection, common descent, and evolutionary adaptation were always there to be discovered. After all, farmers long knew much about inheritance among plants and animals because they bred them so often. Even so, it took an very fortunate moment, like visiting the isolated Galapagos Islands for Darwin, or the Canary Islands for Zographos, to display natural selection and adaptation simply enough to seed evolution in someone's mind.

When life's evolution was realized, it quickly transformed our understanding of the origin of species, including ourselves, in the natural world.

So, what if these two intellectual revolutions had happened together? What if Darwin's insight on evolution had been made, accepted, and popularized along with Ancient Greek contributions like Thales' geometric principles, Euclid's mathematical foundations, and Archimedes' engineering innovations.

This thought experiment says if Socrates, or one of his followers like the hypothetical Magos, had known about evolution he would have made an important connection—that mankind no longer evolved through biology but technology. Thus, the mathematical and engineering foundations Socrates and his students loved weren't only inspirational but intertwined with human affairs because the technical and human domains co-evolve.

It's entirely possible Socrates or his students would have made the connection that because evolution was a natural law for biology, then it must be for humans and our technology as well.

Surrounded by far more wilderness, ancient Greeks cherished their language, plays, ships, trade, and civilization. Wilderness was seen as a dangerous realm that required a civilized hero to subdue. Moreover Greeks were extremely adventurous, competitive, warlike, and commercial. Many people experienced tragedies such as shipwrecks, plagues, or sieges that made technology's value as the differentiator between survival and flourishing readily apparent.

Thus, Greeks might have naturally accepted technological evolution as the guiding principle of their fate. They already had innovative tool using heroes such as Achilles and Odysseus but explained their success because of mythical abilities instead of their willingness to drop tools and master new ones as needed; famously seen when Odysseus built the Trojan horse to finally conquer Troy after failing for a decade to take the walled city by traditional siege warfare.

What the Greeks lacked was an understanding of evolution as a universal law.

This led them, and thus us, down an inaccurate trail, the same way not knowing universal gravitation led Plato's student Aristotle (384–322 BC) to create an Earth-centered universe that guided humanity down the wrong path for centuries.

Interestingly, Aristarchus of Samos (310-230 BC) advocated for a Sun-centered universe. He even calculated the relative sizes of the Sun, Moon, and Earth. Still, Aristotle's ideas won out and became orthodoxy. After rediscovering an old scroll of Aristarchus, Nicholas Copernicus (1473-1543) would later re-establish the Sun-centered model of astronomy in the early 1500s. With this in mind, it's not impossible that an ancient Darwin could have existed among the 99% of ancient knowledge that was lost.

If early thinkers like Socrates, Plato, Aristotle had grasped the principle that humans and their tools co-evolve in response to environmental challenges—how might they have approached questions of ethics, politics, and justice?

Imagine the changes to our history, filled with empires that rise and fall, racism, sexism, slavery, recessions, economic and population booms and collapses, revolutions, civil wars, and so much more we hate but keep coming back?

Perhaps these recurring patterns aren't moral failures or inevitable human flaws, but symptoms of civilizations struggling to adapt to technological changes we don't yet understand. Instead of asking "How do we eliminate war?" or "How do we achieve perfect justice?" an evolutionary Socrates would ask: "What technological pressures create these conflicts?", "How do societies smoothly adapt to new tools and capabilities?", and perhaps most importantly, "How do we teach our kids born with biological instincts to best live in a technological world?"

This reframing doesn't excuse human suffering or injustice, but it offers a different path forward. Rather than assuming our future depends on "bringing down from heaven" superior laws, policies, or moral education, we might focus on understanding how technological ecosystems can evolve toward greater human flourishing—just as Darwin's finches evolved better beaks for their particular island environment rich in either insects, nuts, or seeds.

The interaction between Socrates and our fictional Darwin/Zographos represents the birth of what we might call "evolutionary philosophy", "biology for humans", or "techvolution"—a framework for understanding human societies as technological ecosystems that adapt, evolve, and thrive through the same principles that govern all life.

Yet, this story did not happen.

Socrates and Darwin never met, the same way Aristotle and Newton never did. But this tale serves as food for thought because you know Socrates and Darwin, so despite their distance from each other, they are meeting in you. And that is the vital lesson this short story was meant to teach. The stream of events we call history is not pre-organized for us. In order to advance our story we must be the ones to the connect dots that should be connected. Thus Magos, the thinker who connected Socrates and Darwin, can be real in you.

Why not make it so.

That means despite the lofty goals the Techvolution series is setting out to achieve, we are only adding some of our scientific knowledge to the foundational questions Socrates first posed about human civilization.

That way, we'll correct the path we've been living by applying evolutionary thinking to understand how civilizations adapt to technological change. This will help us consciously guide our civilization's evolution toward a future where people will no longer have to ask "what is justice" because they'll instead be intentionally building it.

## Preface

To most people, corner stores only house quick conveniences. To kids, they are wonderlands of comics and candy, magical spaces where imagination and sweetness live in harmony.

I loved visiting my local store. I would casually browse the options, select a comic and treat, and happily hand over cash to the kind shop owner. A slice from the pizzeria next door always completed the perfect day.

But there lived a real super-villain.

I would stare at it through the "PIZZA" letters on the storefront. Only if there were one kind of slice available could I bypass the tyrant and get the slice I so wanted.

Was the villain poverty? Meekness? Or perhaps it was the pizza cook who disliked my religion or family? The answer is none of these. The truth is far more fundamental and reveals the core message of the book.

I wanted a slice of pizza. Getting it required speaking, and I did not have the ability to do that, as I was born with a speech impediment—a condition affecting about three million Americans from all ages and walks of life. That is why I turned away when the pizza counter had several kinds of slices. I feared, far more than going hungry, being asked "which one" if there were several.

The affliction kicks in when certain sounds trigger a stutter that feels like a severe electric shock. Speaking to strangers makes it worse. Swearing offers blessed relief, but that solution only works among friends.

Modern science has illuminated many of our biological conditions, providing explanations and remedies. In that vein, I was very lucky to receive government-sponsored speech therapy. So, although I was subject to a genetic misfire between thought and speech, I learned I was not a broken person, just someone with a broken tool. I still remember my graduation ceremony at an Italian restaurant.

I got to order anything I wanted. It was pizza, of course.

The point of this story is that when a person confronts a problem today—from buying products to getting a job—we instinctively start with a genetic, cultural, or ethnic identity. Listen to any political speech; it will speak to "single mothers," "elderly voters," "new immigrants," or some other demographic group. I do not want to invalidate these identities, only to clarify something fundamental: in the realm of politics and economics, we are first and foremost users of tools.

Some of these tools are biological, like speaking, but with the explosion of electronics, software, and so many other devices, most of our interactions with the world are now technological. Therefore, our primary identities should be defined by the tools at our disposal, and acquiring better tools to live happier lives ought to be our first priority.

A technological identity is precisely what ideologies strip away from us. For example, an ideologue seeing a hungry kid outside a pizzeria window might attribute the kid's situation to a personal failing—like being irresponsible with money—or systemic injustices—like family poverty or discrimination by the shop owner. Both perspectives are possible, but the fact that the kid might be struggling with a "verbal wheelchair" rarely occurs to people. This oversight happens not because they are unaware of disabilities, but because ideological interpretations are often our default lens when seeing problems in society.

That should not be too surprising. Our ideologies have guided our mindsets for generations. Given the massive technological ecosystem we now enjoy, they have done an admirable job. Yet, conservatism, progressivism, and other belief systems were conceived centuries ago by people seeking to solve their society's problems, primarily addressing the hunger, illiteracy, and poverty of civilization before the Industrial Revolution.

Ideological thinkers still offer valuable insights into societal communication and governance, but their worldview is not rooted in our modern scientific and technological world. They lived without plastic, wrote with bird feathers, and did not learn how evolution shaped the state of nature. Thus, we should not pick one ideology in order to conquer the others. Instead, they are frameworks to be studied as we integrate a technological identity into our consciousness.

In fact, conservatism's emphasis on producing wealth and progressivism's drive for social diversity become complementary forces when viewed through a technological identity.

Conservatism and progressivism empower each other because diversity and mass production are how life populates and updates its ecosystems. Thus, rather than seeing left versus right as opposing forces, we can view them as complementary perspectives contributing to our collective technological evolution.

Of course, as we know, modern progressives and conservatives do not cooperate. For example, Congressional partisanship has been increasing exponentially for over sixty years with no sign of abating or reversing.

As our economic challenges continue to mount, the statistics paint a stark picture of financial strain. Since 1991, Americans' wages have not even kept pace with inflation. Median household income has grown by just 27.9 percent over thirty years, while the cost of living has dramatically outpaced this modest increase. Housing prices have soared 345 percent. Health-care premiums have risen 49 percent between 2013 and 2023. Public college tuition has more than doubled. More recently, grocery costs have risen significantly, with a 20-30% increase from 2020 to 2025.

Unsurprisingly, this widening economic gap has driven debt to unprecedented levels. Student loan debt exploded from nearly $481 billion in 2006 to over $1.7 trillion by 2021. For young adults aged 18-24, mortgage costs tell a similar story—average home debt jumped from under $40,000 in 1992 to $117,000 in 2022. Economic betterment has stopped, with only half of Americans now able to earn more than their parents, compared to 90 percent in 1940.

These are not just cold statistics—they represent a systemic failure. Many ideologues believe that better government policy alone can address our challenges, but evolution demands more: we must adapt by innovating and adopting new tools.

To appease evolution, we must redefine ourselves as technological beings first and foremost. Only that person will critically assess everyone's opinions, PowerPoint presentations, and other narratives on their actual effectiveness in connecting problems with better technologies.

To understand this mindset, consider a simple experiment: combine cold water and ice into a bucket. As you immerse your hand in the water, the cold steals your heat, and your body soon experiences intense pain. This visceral moment reveals a fundamental truth: no words, presentations, or promises keep you warm.

Thus, when evaluating conservatism, progressivism, or any belief system, always judge not by its words, but by its ability to create and distribute tools that overcome your environmental challenges and thereby lower your real-life pains. Most everyone, from bureaucrats to teachers, already says they promote innovation, but only a technological identity will keep all of us honest.

Then we will be in evolution's good graces.

And that is a good place to be. Life has spent billions of years combating heat, hunger, thirst, and cold through adaptation. Arctic fish develop antifreeze proteins. Polar birds grow waterproof feathers. Mammals develop fur and blubber. Each organism's survival depends not on avoiding discomfort, but on developing the right tools to keep pain away in its environment.

Our ancestors lost their insulating hair when they left the trees and learned to walk. How did we stay warm? We cut fur from dead animals and mastered fire. Today, we synthesize materials, generate heat, and create any other solution we can dream up. And while we have gotten very good at reducing our pains, that also means we can easily forget what life on Earth is all about.

Hence, we tend to view the world through human stories, speeches, and ideologies, rather than addressing practical problems as life demands.

Adopting a strong technological identity will make it far easier to stay on the mission of evolution that life gives all creatures. A new identity does not mean abandoning any of our wonderful cultures. We can still enjoy music clubs, celebrate folklore dances, commemorate history, and cheer at the Olympics. However, in a world increasingly shaped by technological systems, we must develop a new mindset to clearly identify our problems and see their best solutions.

Loving the same music as someone else is great fun, but that does not mean you have found the best mechanic. Shared problems create the best political and economic relationships. Just look at how an oak tree and a squirrel benefit each other. One feeds the other, while one seeds the other, and yet they have nothing else in common.

All life forms should work together because Earth is a massive bucket—a vast game board shaped by immutable laws of physics, chemistry, and geology. Life plays the game by constantly creating new creatures so that its partner, evolution, can decide who the players will be. With the right team, Earth is an awe-inspiring oasis—a lone lifeboat in the galactic expanse.

The story of life now involves technology. Its many gadgets, tools, and inventions are already changing the world. The purpose of this book is to help you find the tools that solve the problems of your environment. A recurring theme is how to combat any story that tries to subvert our evolutionary requirement.

Earth will prosper to new heights when human conflict is minimized and cooperation is maximized, not through wishful storytelling or ideological idealism, but through the innate drive that propels all life to seek resources, evade threats, form alliances, and adapt. This drive often shows up in every day situations—such as what I learned as a child when ordering pizza—because our limitations are not who we are, but challenges that better teammates and tools can solve. Techvolution provides a new framework to understand this paradigm and consciously supports the evolution of life on Earth.

## Introduction 

### Catching Life's Eye

Animals are born free, and everywhere they seem to be enjoying themselves. Nature is no doubt a tough place to be. Hunger, disease, thirst, and predation are always just around the corner. Yet, from the mighty grizzly bear to the tiny firefly, organisms all fight to stay alive. It seems creatures enjoy playing the "game of life".

So, how does a life form get selected to become a player? There are three ways to stand out: genes, personality, and tools.

Genes are a creature's blueprint, that together are called its genotype. Each DNA segment provides specific instructions that determine an organism's traits. During reproduction, genes shuffle and recombine, introducing variations in offspring. Most variations are minor and neutral, but occasionally a mutation provides a survival advantage.

Consider the peppered moth during England's Industrial Revolution. As trees darkened due to smog and soot, a rare dark variant of the peppered moth gained a camouflage advantage and its numbers surged. Evolution did not create this mutation; rather, it favored the black moth through natural selection—a process that eliminates harmful genes while allowing organisms with beneficial traits to survive and reproduce.

This continuous process of genetic variation and environmental selection drives the incremental changes we observe in species over time—sometimes slowly, as with glacial changes as geology changes over eons, or suddenly with events like floods, eruptions, or factory soot. Natural selection can only work with what already exists, thus evolution favors genetic diversity of all kinds because it increases the likelihood of producing life forms that can survive and reproduce in changing environments.

The next way a creature can stand out is its phenotype. The phenotype is akin to a life form's personality; the observable characteristics of an organism resulting from the interaction between its genetic makeup and environmental influences, encompassing physical traits, behavioral adaptations, and learned experiences. Think of two acorns, one planted in a tall forest, the other in an open field. The first grows lean and tall to reach sunlight, while the other grows bushier and more robust. Phenotype reveals how organisms adapt to their surroundings and become products of their environment.

Phenotypic adaptations show remarkable diversity. Some are immediate, like a lizard changing color for camouflage, while others develop over generations, such as an elephant mother teaching her young where the water holes are. Natural selection does not prefer one phenotype over another; like with genes, it wants huge diversity to increase the chance of finding those best suited to survive and reproduce in the current environment.

The third way creatures stand out is the extended phenotype. These are adaptations that creatures build for themselves. Think of bird nests, beaver dams, and ant hills. Although made of foreign material, these things act like any other organ by helping a creature better survive.

Take the common squirrel as an example. The small creature survives frigid winters by storing food and building warm nests. These adaptations greatly increase its survival rate. Extended phenotypes empower organisms to mold their environment to their benefit and thereby select themselves for survival.

Unlike genes and phenotypes, extended phenotypes become part of the environment and are available for other creatures to use. For example, crabs use seashells, ants occupy termite hills, and bats inhabit old bird nests. This shows that the creator of an extended phenotype is not always its user.

Raccoons are the ultimate example. Originally from the tropical forests of Central America, these intelligent creatures naturally create dens in hollow trees and grow thicker fur and fat stores for winter. However, unlike squirrels, raccoons do not naturally insulate their burrows, store food, or fully hibernate. Still, they have managed to spread their range across North America, all because of human civilization's barns, garages, and garbage. Although raccoons created none of these things, they can use them, and therefore life selects them in great numbers, even though, unlike squirrels, who plant millions of nuts each year, raccoons have no reciprocal contribution to the technological ecosystem that provides for them.

So, to stay a player in the game of life, creatures can stand out via their genes, phenotypes, and extended phenotypes. The right mixture means an animal can harvest enough resources and protect itself long enough to procreate and thereby keep playing the game.

Now, in our quest to better understand ourselves, which of these scenarios do you think best describes humans in the 21st century?

### Doesn't My Insurance Cover This?

The answer is the raccoon. Like them, we live, work, and exist in an ecosystem of tools without knowing how they work. This is why the thesis of this book is that humans are now primarily a technological species that is not yet self-aware of our new identity. I will use my story again to explain why.

Among my many genetic traits is the aforementioned speech impediment. Centuries ago, it would have been debilitating. Belief systems were more mythological, leading many to believe that a stutterer was a simpleton and a candidate for neglect or worse. I can sympathize; in childhood, I was thought to be one because I rarely talked. But when the problem was identified at my elementary school, a speech therapist was assigned, and the shackles of my genetic heritage began to be removed.

I still had the resulting shyness of my phenotype to overcome. That story is like that of most people growing up, with kids unconsciously adapting to their social environment as best they can. However, the impediment resurfaced when my software employer said my speech impediment was still noticeable, so I resolved to fix it with a job in a notoriously chaotic insurance claims call center. Within a year, the "sink or swim" kind of shock speech therapy finally worked out most of my speaking tool's glitches.

My experience is not unique; many people face similar challenges, from social anxiety to dyslexia. The key point is that we now have numerous ways to address these issues. Advances in science—such as mapping the human genome—and in psychology—with various therapies—provide significant support. Unlike in the past, when even Julius Caesar had to hide his epilepsy, we have great help available once a person chooses to use it. Evolution now has little reason to reject individuals based on their genotype or phenotype.

As for the extended phenotype, before the Industrial Revolution, we were often like squirrels using tools made from the natural world. Technology still amazed us, but things such as sod houses, wood saws, and paper books are physical objects easy to hold, safe to smell, and natural to the touch. However, after the massive explosion of chemicals, materials, electricity, electronics, software, and so many other things over the past 150 years, we are now like raccoons who depend on things we do not truly understand.

I know this in my soul. After my speech improved as a claims adjuster, I looked around and realized how valuable the job was. I processed more than 7,000 claims and spoke with more than 30,000 people from all walks of life. By getting into people's shoes when their furnaces died, cars crashed, or houses flooded, the job is basically a daily experiment on our economy for anyone empathetic enough to listen to people's pains. For a political economy student being a claims adjuster was an intellectual gold mine.

The ultimate lesson was how people struggle to understand modern technologies. We live in a world of increasing complexity but diminishing comprehension. From wealthy executives to blue-collar workers, everyone is equally perplexed by a car crash or a malfunctioning piece of technology. People rarely understand their own possessions or the rules governing their use, yet continue buying and selling technology, always one glitch away from asking, "Doesn't my insurance cover this?" to a person on the phone as if I had a magic wand to erase their problems.

I was so often a customer's best hope, yet all I had was a Google search and a stingy checkbook.

Modern technology has changed how evolution selects us. Comparing top causes of death in modern America and ancient societies (circa 500 BC) reveals our new selection pressure. Modern America's list is dominated by chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes, linked to our sedentary lifestyle that is so pervasive raccoons suffer from many of the same problems. In contrast, ancient societies suffered greatly from infectious diseases and injuries due to poor sanitation, limited medical care, and frequent wars. Notably, infant mortality has dropped dramatically, from approximately 50 percent in the Bronze Age to under 0.8 percent in America today.

Unless a sudden catastrophe like factory soot or a meteor impact occurs, species typically die off gradually. Our falling birthrate is a prime example. While many blame younger generations for being negligent, the evolutionary truth is more complex: our economy remains trapped in a bygone era's lifestyle. Baby boomers continue to monopolize resources and block technological evolution, inadvertently clinging to the so-called "American Dream" rooted in their upbringing in the 1950s and 1960s.

As a result, instead of adopting new tools and new ways of life that solve modern problems, we work to re-create the past with endless movie remakes, "all-new" car commercials, and more suburban housing, shopping centers, and office parks. It is not anyone's fault; we simply lack self-awareness of our technological identity and the evolutionary imperative to embrace new work habits, travel requirements, food choices, and so many other changes in our way of life.

The suburban, car-dependent culture and the idea of a lifelong career are becoming increasingly unsustainable. They are struggling—if not dying—branches on the tree of life. Yet, we do not have an identity that accepts these pains and uses modern tools to create a new way of life.

Boomers inadvertently limit younger generations' economic opportunities by maintaining outdated office technologies and work cultures. By preserving familiar Microsoft Office tools, traditional commuting patterns, and love of offshoring, they unintentionally restrict technological evolution. Most lack understanding of modern technologies like HTML, SQL, and 3D printers, reducing potential innovations to mere consumer products rather than transformative tools that makes human reproduction easier.

For example, an insurance appraiser I worked with used a measuring wheel to measure the dimensions of large commercial buildings, taking days to complete what others did in hours with lasers. Another boomer, the CEO, banned smartphones for adjusters, insisting on landline phones despite customers already embracing faster communication in their daily lives. Again, nobody intends to be obstinate, but those with outdated skill sets have good reason to resist the change new tools on the tree of life bring.

The youth recognize that their future is being sacrificed, which is reflected in the huge popularity of dystopian stories like _Ready Player One_, _The Hunger Games_ and _Divergent_ in young adult fiction. Techvolution offers an alternative: by understanding technological evolution, we can transform our sense of powerlessness into agency, turning dystopian fears into a roadmap for deliberate, positive change.

The key lesson is that evolution cannot select us for our best intentions. Despite natural selection constantly rejecting many aspects of our modern lifestyle, we remain too fixated on our genes and personality to listen and adapt. To purposefully evolve a better way of life, we must tune our identity to seek out, embrace, and protect new tools that are, for now, being held back.

This is not a proclamation against boomers. Because, as the history of depressions or total collapses goes, be it Royalist France or the Soviet Union, it is the elderly pensioners who see their benefits cut the worst, and thus they should be the first to fix our society's worsening problems.

To solve our problems with upgraded tools, we need to see ourselves as we are.

Consider this: what is more concerning—spraining an ankle or having water pipes burst during vacation? Our ancestors might fear a lion when facing a physical injury, but today we would simply rest and watch Netflix. However, burst pipes could bankrupt you. I should know; I had to deny claims because homeowners broke the unknown conditions of their insurance policies. If they had been technologically self-aware enough to perform a simple two-minute water shut-off, they could have prevented years of hardship and earned a nod from evolution.

Yet, we rarely examine the "extended phenotype" part of ourselves. We remain barely conscious of our technological identities and fail to proactively develop skills that would satisfy evolutionary pressures. Far more people define themselves by gender, race, or heritage, compared to the tools they use to gather resources. Technological identity reveals who we truly are when we strip away labels—the tools we use, the problems we solve, and our ability to adapt and survive in a constantly changing world.

Unaware of most modern tools, we resemble raccoons opportunistically using technology we encounter, believing things like genetics, education, or ideologies explain our success or failure. As evolution penalizes our ignorance, we must look in the mirror and be honest about what we see: people who passionately discuss human genes and/or personality, but are in reality fighting to control tools, even ones as simple as a pencil.

### Avoiding Evolution's Stare

Charles Darwin proposed evolution in 1859. His idea was radical, challenging much of the established knowledge of the time. Religious individuals believed Earth was only a few thousand years old, while scientific thinkers estimated perhaps a few million years; everyone knew that if all life forms had evolved from a common ancestor, as Darwin suggested, then more time was surely needed to account for the diversity seen on Earth.

Because evolution explained the observable world so precisely, evidence accumulated rapidly, transforming both scientific and popular understanding. Within decades, humanity adopted a new paradigm of evolution via natural selection, and scientists demonstrated its intricate mechanisms—ecosystems, co-evolution, genetic variation, and speciation—that populated our planet with an astonishing diversity of life over billions of years.

Simultaneously, fields such as physics, chemistry, geology, and mathematics were advancing, enriching humanity with wonders like electricity, medical cures, and aviation. As nature revealed its mysteries, one might ask: Why did we not apply evolution's principles to our own civilization?

We attempted to do so, but because we saw only genotype or phenotype in our reflection, we were destined to fail. Remember that evolution does not prescribe good ideas; it simply selects out the bad ones. Two of the worst ideas ever subjected to evolutionary forces were fascism and communism. These two ideologies attempted to purify either the genotype or phenotype and thereby impose their own selective criteria on humanity through eugenics and social engineering, respectively.

Of course, humanity has had many bad ideas before. But fascism and communism were particularly horrible because they had access to modern science, which they tried to use to validate their false premises. Genotype-focused fascist and Nazi scientists developed theories that attributed human success solely to genetics—for example, claiming that head shape determined intelligence. Phenotype-focused communist and Soviet scientists insisted on absolute genetic equality, attributing all success to environmental factors, even in cases like plant seeds.

With access to modern machinery, mathematics, and other advancements, one ideology enacted mass imprisonment, forced sterilization, and the Holocaust, while the other did mass incarcerations and executions during the Great Purges and caused devastating famines through agricultural policies that criminalized genetic studies and planted crops unsuited to local climates.

While eugenics and social engineering were tried in our western society, our ideologies predate evolutionary understanding, making it easier to move beyond ill-conceived attempts at genotype or phenotype purification. However, the debate persists in a more nuanced form in the ongoing "nature versus nurture" debate between conservatives and progressives. The former emphasizes generating wealth through genetic potential and minimal government intervention, and the latter focuses on distributing wealth to overcome inequalities with targeted social programs.

When seen through evolution's eyes, conservatives champion efficiency and mass-production of technology while progressives advocate for creativity and diverse perspectives. When isolated, both groups move to their extremes and live too much in their ideological world. However, when brought together, these views complement each other and fulfill the evolutionary need to mass-produce new adaptations to keep life up to date.

Accepting our technological nature is the crucial bridge for these two perspectives. When we insist on technological evolution, both sides need each other and are therefore incentivized to compromise. Instead of attempting to purify our genotypes or phenotypes, we should refine our narratives, belief systems, and ideologies to harness evolutionary laws so we continually create and distribute new tools.

Our new identity will require us to accept the occasional loss of professional and personal identities that technological evolution demands. The abject failures of communism and fascism serve as a stark reminder to cultivate flexibility and adaptability, rather than trying to resist the forces of evolution for individual benefit.

It must be asked, with all the death and conflict caused by attempts to evolve our genotype or phenotype, why was it so difficult for humanity to recognize ourselves as technological beings? The reason is the same as why accepting evolution took so long: it contradicts the paradigms entrenched in our minds. Like all life forms, competing in the game of life is in our nature. And what better strategy for survival than possessing a tool that others lack, or better yet, need?

To illustrate, in the aftermath of fascist and communist atrocities, psychologist Stanley Milgram experimented to understand how ordinary people participated in such events. At Yale University in 1961, participants were instructed to act as "teachers" and administer electric shocks to a "learner" (an actor) for errors in a memory test. An authoritative scientist with a clipboard and pencil would insist politely that the experiment continue, even as the learner appeared to suffer increasing pain.

Psychologists were astonished when every "teacher"—despite often feeling agonizing guilt—administered severe shocks, and a full 65 percent of participants activated what they believed were fatal electric shocks. Repeated studies across various groups yielded similar results, revealing a disturbing truth about human behavior: most people can suppress their moral instincts under pressure from perceived legitimate authority.

Perhaps because of my speech impediment, watching these experiments highlighted a simple truth: we should never judge one another's raw capabilities. To me, the Milgram experiment is not primarily about humanity's willingness to follow orders but about our limited awareness, despite having pencils and paper available, no participant considered offering these tools to the "learner" to improve memory. Life has always overcome adversity with adaptations, yet here we were inflicting pain on each other instead of simply providing a pencil. Humans need tools—I would likely need one to communicate my answer without stuttering, just as the scientist used a pencil to record test results.

Yet, even well-intentioned academics often define humanity through narrow identities—genetic, cultural, or social—rather than recognizing that our true power stems from the technologies we use to solve problems. The ideological narratives we construct about superiority—whether based on education, bloodline, race, gender, or class—are misconceptions stemming from technological imbalances.

An ideology-first identity frequently misleads us about our suffering as well, such as "I am poor or hungry because I am a [insert self-identity]." While this identity may explain why other humans target us, the root cause of pain is actually a technological failing. Evolution cannot see our self-identity, but only the adaptations we use to interact with the world, i.e., our tools.

These misconceptions harm those in authority the most, as they often claim biological credit for their tools. Historical examples show that regimes with strong ideological foundations—such as the Confederate States of America, Nazi Germany, and the Soviet Union—were unsustainable in the long term, partly because they promoted genotype-based identities (like racism and sexism) or phenotype-based identities (like classism and elitism) as paths to prosperity, and thereby stopped the creation and distribution of new tools societies need to thrive.

There is no inherent human genotype or phenotype superiority. Our success depends on enhancing capabilities through technology, and like the squirrel and oak tree, we rely on others' technological empowerment to sustain the technological ecosystem we depend on. From Ancient Rome to modern America, successful civilizations have expanded through innovations like roads, libraries, and smartphones. Evolution teaches that individual organisms prosper best when in a ecosystem filled with other healthy individuals.

We should want to give everyone a pencil, purely out of self-interest. We never know who might be the next "black moth" that saves us. After all, once England reduced its industrial soot, the tree bark returned to its pale color, and the now rare peppered variant moth was selected again and ensured the species' survival.

For now, we invent technology but do not naturally distribute it to others. This shortcoming appears in various contexts: workplaces where employees receive tools without choices or input yet are judged on their performance using the tools; schools that test children's knowledge and memory while denying common aids like notes or calculators; and individuals who neglect their own toolsets, hoping instead that an insurance representative will resolve their issues with a claim check.

Withholding technological tools, such as the transformation of software from products we own to services we perpetually rent, as well as the "right to repair" and "work from home" movements, explains much of our current problems. From Gen Z to retirees modern digital technologies—like the printing press in earlier eras—are tools people cannot yet freely control to earn an prosperous independent livelihood.

### Opening Our Evolutionary Potential

Fortunately, one group is emerging from the technological landscape: a diverse community of makers, programmers, and designers in the open-source community. They embrace the constant effort and frequent failures that evolution demands. They are too focused on debugging, correcting errors, and welcoming quality contributions to concern themselves with a person's genotype or phenotype.

Open-source contributors are examples for us all. They evolve solutions to real-life pains. That is why they have created many of your favorite tools, such as Wikipedia, Khan Academy, and the software underpinning the internet. These technologies are worth billions and provided free for anyone to use and adapt. Inspired by their character, this book is open-source distributed via Writebook, another open-source software program based on Ruby on Rails, an amazing technology that powers Basecamp, GitHub, Shopify, and thousands of other products.

However, the open-source community is not perfect. It can be chronically under funded and projects often fragment to their own detriment. Regardless, the community keeps innovating. That's why the future of the Internet Age, as outlined in the "Bumblebee Economics", does not require marches or a revolution. Because of the open-source community, if you hold a smartphone or laptop, the seeds of this future are already in your hands. You only need to adopt a new identity to realize your potential: a self-aware technological being improving its life through peaceful, gradual technological evolution. This concept required a name, hence the new term "techvolution."

With this new paradigm, you can join the open-source community to develop and disseminate tools that identify the "black moths" in countless niches. Issues like increasing debt, declining health, rising living costs, heightened storm activity, and many others cannot be resolved until the individuals experiencing these physical pains can select the tools to solve them in the million of unique niches around the world. Open-source technologies are poised to provide customized solutions that are readily available to everyone, "black camouflage" for all, in a manner of speaking.

And we are naturally equipped for this role. Researching this book joyously taught me how to look past ideological identities and connect with the individuals within. Our innate drive to learn and evolve shines brightly when we define ourselves by the future. In the interviews I did, most people would quickly share their passions for sewing custom clothes, optimizing 3D printers, or creating efficient home gardens. A technological identity is already within us, right beside the music, heroes, and social groups we cherish. None of our current identities need not change as we realize our dreams through technological progress.

However, until humanity intentionally accelerates the technological evolution we depend on, we remain like raccoons suffering through seemingly random restaurant closures and secured waste bins. Our list of problems includes job losses, business failures, psychological disorders, political animosity, civil wars, revolutions, and the cycles of imperial rise and fall. We mistakenly attribute these events to ideology when in reality, they stem from the unnoticed co-evolution, variation, and speciation of technological ecosystems, which occur continuously around us, indifferent to human-constructed identities, borders, and beliefs.

Only a new identity will allow us to glimpse behind the curtain of evolution and learn to harness its powers, as we have already done in physics, chemistry, and medicine. The next step toward self-realization is to ask if we must cooperate like trees and squirrels do—then, who are we competing against in the game of life?

## Chapter 1—Presents Under the Tree

We have a long history of competing against each other. Numberless wars, raids, and conquests showcase that well enough. Even today, in our relative peace and prosperity, people commonly vote their self-interests yet still often become confrontational when others do the same.

To better solve our problems, we need to update our identity and mindsets to accept the primacy of our technological identity. Only then will we harness natural laws that empower us to grow and harvest from a vibrant technological ecosystem. Only then can we together confront our true enemy.

Who is our true enemy?

It surrounds us every day. Even right now, it causes you worry and concern, yet with so many ideologies and beliefs in our minds, it will take some doing to appreciate its power over all creatures. I'd like to start that long journey by telling you a short story about how important new technology is to us. It's one of my most memorable claims. 

It came in one cold December afternoon, a few days before Christmas.

A young family's home had been robbed. Someone had broken in, stolen appliances, cash, jewelry, and even the presents under the tree. Sadly, the criminals didn't stop with theft. They also heartlessly sprayed the entire house with a fire extinguisher. The white chemical powder blanketed every surface, and although it looked like fake snow, it is actually unsafe, especially for kids.

Days from the big night, a family home was turned into a violated, thieved, unlivable space.

Yet, while listening to the parents, it was clear they only cared one thing. It wasn't relief from the arduous police and insurance paperwork, or the correct market value of their family heirlooms. Their pain was only for their kids lost Christmas.

Time to fight the Grinch and spread some cheer!

So, instead of the typical hotel stay, I got them a fully furnished condo and had it decorated for Christmas. I also expedited the claim payments to quickly replace their stolen presents.

Within a few days, the family had warm bedrooms, full kitchen, glistening tree, wrapped gifts, even milk and cookies for the big guy. Everything needed to make Hallmark memories. In fact, it felt like I helped create the ending of _Home Alone 2_ when the McCallister family woke up to many presents in their Plaza hotel room.

The parents were very grateful. They even congratulated me on my recent promotion: "I can see why you got it" was really nice to hear. I received so much thanks because by getting them a home, their kids never stopped believing Santa would find them on Christmas Eve.

Not all claims ended so well. I must admit I cherish this one.

The point of this story is, however, somewhat different. As we journey to better solve our problems by updating our self-identity, I want to put you in a unique frame of mind. One far away from the fighting so prevalent in our politics, or the angst of every day life. I want you to remember the childish glee you had when holding a present.

It could be your birthday, graduation, or favorite holiday. Whichever memory is your most precious, I invite you to embrace the feeling it gives you.

Because it's time to wake up and run downstairs to see something made just for you. It is wrapped in silver and gold with your name elegantly written in deep black ink.

As you lift it into the air, you clench it with a hug, tear apart the bow and wrapping paper, and toss open the box with pure unbridled joy. You can't wait to embrace the wonders of something entirely new.

The box is labelled "Game of Life". Inside you discover:

Sand clock, board game, modeling clay, scoreboard, and booklet. Now you wonder: How do these seemingly ordinary objects reshape human identity and unite us against our common enemy?

Infected with curiosity, you pick up the booklet, and...

## Chapter 2—Booklet: The Rules to the Game

You pick up the booklet and flip to its first page.

It starts off with "Imagine you are a person in a perfectly flat world. A land where everything is two-dimensional." As you continue reading you learn a 2D existence is like an avatar living on a computer screen. You can move left, right, up, or down, but never can you jump out from the screen.

Because in this world, there's no height.

In this 2D reality, avatars are like magnets on a fridge, bumper cars on a track, or cookie cutters on a baker's table. Only able to move two ways, a person would have to feel an object to know about it. Every person and thing are just outlines of various polygons.

Four angles make a square, five a pentagon, six a hexagon, and so forth into great variety. To these creatures, we 3D entities would appear as merely passing through their 2D world, appearing first as a point, then growing into a curved weird shape, then shrinking back to a point again.

This booklet takes this idea from "Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions". Written by Edwin A. Abbott, that book popularized dimensional thinking and is often used in mathematics, philosophy, and science education like this booklet to get people to think of totally alien environments.

By bringing us into a 2D world, Abbott makes us feel lost. Learning about Flatland opens the door for us to see our reality differently and thereby better question and understand our own existence.

We sometimes experience this feeling of being lost in our every day lives too.

Once, I wanted to enjoy some back country open roads. I thought I was going north and would inevitably hit the highway. Driving alone, windows down, with no phone coverage, and no maps or compass, I had a blast. I was actually going east and hit nothing. Standing outside the beater car with little gas was quite disorienting and somewhat scary as night fell.

Many will have more dangerous stories, others more comical, but we all should remember that feeling of being lost. As we forge a new technological identity, we should embrace this ever educational feeling for its immensely educational benefits.

For the same reason Abbott wrote his famous story. Because everything about us, from our eyes, to bones, to mindset, is a by product of our reality. And, we cannot leave it anymore than a hexagon can leave Flatland.

To understand our existence requires thinking outside our own dimensions. And as two-dimensions control the fates of polygons in Flatland, our reality is similarly controlled by all-powerful rules.

Only our reality has far more, which we call the universal laws of nature.

Physics, astronomy, chemistry, geology, and biology define our reality. Together they make a rulebook, but unlike chess or Monopoly there is no booklet to read or program to hack. Nor does the rulebook ever care about our input, ideas, or feedback.

Instead, life can be thought of as a game of trying to overcome, utilize, and understand these rules well enough to survive.

This is why life's evolution is such a persistent and universal process. Evolution has been the driver of countless species over billions of years, because there's no other way to know what's out there in the universe but to send beings out to find out.

Like many individual Squares venturing out to settle the world.

Touching around in the darkness turns our senses—touch, smell, and sight—into crude teachers. Success brings pleasure, failure brings pain, and slowly these experiences guide us to repeat what works and avoid what doesn't. We can imagine this learning method anytime we stop drinking water. Thirst will soon drive anyone to seek water to stop the pain of dehydration.

But using this method means we won't truly understand ourselves, we'll simply know how to evolve by fighting off our pains. Instead, we can be like avatars jumping off the screen to see our 2D reality from a higher place. Because when we know the rules of the game, we can evolve our new technological identity with purpose and intention.

We need to. 

Internet Age technology is changing our existence very fast and in countless ways. One example is the Mars rovers. These are technological explorers navigating an alien place. They extend human perception far beyond our biological limitations. Sending back information from another planet we may soon colonize transforms our existence in ways we don't yet appreciate.

Living with technology so powerful we might soon be a multiple planetary species means we're in such a new place we're not unlike the Square trying to understand the three dimensions for the first time.

With so much technological change today, our best life depends on understanding the rules of the reality we inhabit. Just as a two-dimensional being must accept its constraints to navigate its world, we must recognize the fundamental laws that govern our existence. These rules are all powerful and they do not care about our wants, plans, or beliefs anymore then Flatland cares about a triangle's or square's desire to jump.

Our deep acceptance of the rules of the game is the foundation for the mastery we need to move from being biological to technological beings.

The more knowledge the better. Unlike nearly everything else in the universe, we knowingly grow, learn, love. We are self-aware that we need shelter, food, water, and procreation to stay alive.

Therefore, unlike Flatland, our planet is not just a place of existence, but a proving ground where the laws of nature constantly probe, challenge, and select only a few to live on to keep playing the game of survival. Each of us is a unique shape, the goal is to empower us all to rise above the darkness in this relentless, ongoing experiment of survival.

So let's jump up off the screen and see what the game board of our three dimensions looks like.

- Christmas story tie-in, potentially, "such if the power of getting an unknown piece technology, it can actualize a part of our psyche that would otherwise be left dormant."

## Chapter 3—Game Board: The Emergent Environment

_Flatland_ starts with the Square explaining his 2D existence to the reader. There are various houses, workplaces, and people. Everything knows each other by the amount of angles they have. Having more angles brings better social status.

One day a Sphere shows up.

The curious Square asks this alien what he is and where he comes from. Even though the Square had previously envisioned a 1D world, comprehending the third dimension escapes him.

So, the Sphere takes the pair to the 3D world, called Spaceland. The Square sees depth in action and returns home and tells his people about the amazing discovery. Like so many intellectual pioneers, the Square isn't met with a happy reception. Without the ability to show others, he remains the only one to know the third dimension is real.

As is so often the case, seeing is the only path to believing in Flatland.

And this is a good way to think of our game board. The laws of nature make the universe all around us. They do not have a voice that announces them to anyone. Instead they are embedded in the very fabric of existence.

Their countless interactions manifest into the universe.

Consider our Moon—not merely a celestial object, but a profound result of cosmic collision and gravitational interaction. Approximately 4.5 billion years ago, a Mars-sized planetary body called Theia collided with the early Earth.

The collision was so violent it ejected massive amounts of molten rock and debris into Earth's orbit. Gravity began pulling these fragments together. Over time, these fragments coalesced, cooling and solidifying into what we now know as the Moon.

That's why there is little to no heavy elements like iron and gold on the Moon, it was mostly lighter stuff that got ejected away from Earth all those years ago.

The collision between early Earth and Theia was so massive it melted Earth's core for billions of years. Yet, even this massive collision was controlled by the natural laws the entire time.

The Moon, though one of many moons in our solar system, becomes significant only through our interactions with it. It causes our oceans tides, illuminates the night, has mysterious phases, and could be colonized. These opportunities and obstacles in our path transform it from a distant object into a component of our game board of survival.

The game board is thus an emergent property. A place where the natural laws of physics, astronomy, chemistry, geology, and biology make a universe all around us. But only when we encounter this universe as a means of survival does our game board emerge.

Proximity is not the test. Instead the natural laws are like a game maker in "The Hunger Games" ever presenting us with obstacles and opportunities as the definition of the rules of the game.

Recently physicists discovered at least two mass extinction events in Earth's history that were likely caused by supernova explosions. Researchers say these super-powerful blasts--caused by the death of a massive star--may have stripped our planet's atmosphere of its ozone, sparked acid rain and exposed life to harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun.

They believe a supernova explosion could be to blame for both the late Devonian and Ordovician extinction events, which occurred 372 and 445 million years ago respectively.

Imagine that.

One of those tinkering lights up in the night sky could either be utterly too far away to ever care about. Or they could kill almost everything on Earth and life has to return to the starting line.

The game board is variable. It could be a super nova millions of lightyears away, a Moon within eyesight, or it could be the cold of night closing in on a lost traveler who thought he was enjoying a country ride.

In an infinite Universe, the number of dimensions we need to comprehend is near infinite as well. Hence why our ability to perceive different dimensions is so crucial to our survival.

But why can't we just take our time? Why is there such consequence to our choices. The answer lies inside the natural laws of the universe. It's why all games come with clocks.

## Chapter 4—Sandglass: The Ever Present Clock

Ever wondered how the game board is made? I mean, volcanoes, stars, everything, how do tiny atoms come together into such unique objects? After all, it's not like nature has "make a volcano" button like in video games. Reality has no such shortcuts. Instead, each thing in the Universe is a byproduct of the natural laws, the rules of the game, interacting with each other.

Let's see how with volcanoes.

Gravity, pulls molten rock downward, while plate tectonics generates immense pressure and heat, and thermodynamics drives heat transfer and energy transformation the entire time. Mix them together, and molten rock from deep within the Earth's crust pushes up through weak points in the planet's surface to form volcanoes.

Stars are of course bigger, but made with the same interaction of natural forces. Gravity concentrates huge hydrogen gas clouds into a ball. Once the density peaks hydrogen atoms fuse into helium through nuclear fusion, emitting massive amounts of electromagnetic radiation into space. The enormous energy released counteracts gravity and keeps the star from imploding on itself.

We could continue non-stop for any natural object, because everything is a byproduct of the forces of nature. These forces are always in action and are always turning atoms into unique objects with distinct material and energy properties.

And, across the entire Universe, that's how our reality, the game board, is made.

But just as these forces create volcanoes, stars, and everything else, they also inevitably lead to their destruction. Because the same laws that birth these objects, will over time, consume them—natural forces both organize and disorganize matter.

And understanding how objects disarrange into their component parts is effectively our game clock; because it tells us how much time we have left.

Science calls it the second law of thermodynamics. It's most commonly called entropy. This is the fundamental law that describes how objects and energy systems naturally tend to increase in disorganization over time.

In a way, entropy is the universe's natural accounting system for energy transformation. The results of the statistical behavior of particles probabilistically shifting between states of order and disorder. For example, natural forces create stars that generate immense radiation energy, but natural force also use up this fuel and turn the star effectively dark.

To realize what the second law of thermodynamics does over time, think of this comparison.

Earth and Mars were once about the same. Their cores were hot magma. They had protective magnetospheres. Their atmospheres thick with gases. Liquid water flowed in rivers as volcanoes shaped the landscape. Unlike some planets Mars and Earth were far from bland or boring. Energy from their cores, magnetospheres, and gravity organized many unique objects like mountains, lakes, and atmosphere. The forces of nature created two similar game boards.

But entropy is always there.

Thus, volcanic explosions and freezing water degrade mountains, wind storms turn rock into sands, sunlight dries up wetlands, and after enough heat is lost in the core, magnetospheres end their shielding, and solar radiation expels gases from the atmosphere. All of this turns the planet still and motionless, like Mars is today. Its core has mostly frozen, its atmosphere is all but gone, and the planet has no more volcanic eruptions because there is almost no heat left to build up the energy for it.

Mars shows a world of increasing uniformity and less organization. But Earth still has much of everything because our core is still very hot. Even so, entropy is always acting on it. Thus, billions of years from now, the heat will run out, the magnetosphere will die, and the natural forces via wind, rust, erosion, radiation will make Earth again like Mars.

And, neither will ever return to their former glory.

That is why entropy is often called the arrow of time. Events in the Universe can only happen once. Meaning a volcano's explosive eruption will never spontaneously reverse itself, the same way a pot of coffee will never un-mix to its original milk, bean, and sugar parts.

All this means there is no going back. So, not only is every place in the Universe unique, but so is every moment.

Albert Einstein called it space time. This term combines the three dimensions of space we saw in the game board (length, width, height) with the dimension of time into a single, interconnected four-dimensional continuum.

And this is our game clock.

While the game board can tell you where you are, the game clock tells us when you exist. Combining the two makes every second you live, whether it's a walk in the park or reading this page, totally unique. 

The game board and game clock are forever emergent and relative to where and when you exist in the Universe.

We should be realizing the laws of nature are more than scientific concepts—they are the ultimate game maker, because each changes our reality constantly. So, unlike chess pieces who get to play on the same board over and over. Our game board is always changing under our feet.

The game clock reminds us to hurry up and run. Entropy will never stop dispersing organized structures we're standing on, be they volcanoes, beaches, pyramids, or tanks of gas.

We can emulate the game clock with sand clocks, time pieces, or any other device. Each tells us we only have so much time left before entropy catches up to us.

And this reveals the ultimate challenge: in a universe constantly dispersing into disorder, can anything create faster than entropy can destroy? This requires an essence—a player—that the Universe has never imagined before.

## Chapter 5—Clay: What Life Is, The Creator of Players

Done with the game clock, you sit it aside on top of the game board and continue reading the booklet. Now you pick up the clay and roll it in your hands: smash, stretch, roll, pinch.  How does this soft malleable stuff relate to the Game of Life?

First let's go back and emphasize something very important.

Most people know Albert Einstein's work E = mc². This revolutionary equation says "Energy equals mass times the speed of light squared", which when doing the math means even a small amount of mass stores an enormous of energy. More importantly, this equation says in the right circumstance (like inside stars), matter and energy can be converted into the other.

Scientifically there is no direct link between entropy and Einstein's equation, but noting mass and energy equivalency helps us understand a crucial point. As entropy does its thing degrading objects into uniformity, energy is never created or destroyed, but just moved around into different states of radiation (light) or matter.

Basically, the natural forces have no delete button. Only a modify button. Incidentally, this principle is the first law of thermodynamics.

For example, the energy that once fueled Mars hot magma core was not erased, it only radiated into space. As heat dissipated away it came to a useless state; it was no longer concentrated and organized enough to do anything. Useful energy is a physical quantity that represents the capacity to do work or cause change in a physical system, like Earth's still hot magma core is doing right now.

Useful energy is what entropy slowly drains away from any organized system, from active plants, to volcanoes, to coffee pots.

Enter the modeling clay, while still playing in your hands, you're starting to realize something.

There have been countless different forms of life, but every single one has this in common; living organisms unite matter via metabolism. These are a set of chemical processes that occur within a living organism to maintain life. It involves breaking down nutrients to release energy and using that energy to build, repair, and discard cellular structures. Metabolism's constant growth is how life fights off entropy's degradation.

And most importantly, we pass on life's baton to the next generation, and thereby organize more matter as time goes on. Life turns the same elements available throughout the Universe into pockets of anti-entropy. And that's how we defeat entropy's increasing degradation over time and stay on the game board.

If life can keep harnessing enough energy to stay alive.

And since every location and moment in time is unique, that means life must customize itself to harness whatever useful energy is available regardless of time, place, and whatever has happened in the never returning past.

Hence the modeling clay in your hands.

This clay lets life mold itself to its place on the game board, meaning its environment. Entropy attacks the clay like everything else, individual lifeforms get tired, weathered, and worn, but by birthing new clay, life stays malleable enough to find the new ways to harness available energy. Thereby life continues to grow as time goes forward.

Of course life is not clay. There's something far more elegant at work.

Life emerged around 3.7 to 4.1 billion years ago. Earth was dramatically different. A molten, volatile landscape constantly bombarded by asteroids, an atmosphere rich in methane, ammonia, and hydrogen. In short, our planet looked like a disaster movie in progress.

Yet, it was here life started.

Science has some ideas how, but despite many experiments trying to spark "primordial ooze" as one theory calls the rich, chemical-laden matter of early Earth, where complex organic molecules might have first combined into self-replicating cells. But nothing's worked so far. In a world where science has stolen many of our mysteries, the emergence of life on Earth is still as wondrous as ever. And with so much uncertainty, each person is free to believe whatever they want was the start of it all.

The point is life did start.

Matter somehow started to turn into an organized state. While we do not know the exact mechanism of life's origin, once it got going, life grew by molecules gaining the ability to create copies of itself. Thereafter, molecules kept finding the energy to buck entropy and keep replicating themselves.

New clay was being born.

The nearest energy source was hydrothermal vents, which scientists suspect fostered the first microbial life forms called anaerobic prokaryotes. These primitive organisms, similar to bacteria, represented the first sparks of life on a young, turbulent planet filled with harsh environments.

For billions of years these primitive creatures lived. In a sense they could be seen as colonizers.

Because early prokaryotes called cyanobacteria converted energy into matter that gradually transformed the environment through photosynthesis, which produced oxygen. We take this chemical for granted today, but it is rare, supercharges metabolism, and because it converts sunlight back into matter, has a near endless energy source. 

Converting toxic gases into oxygen fundamentally altered the Earth's atmosphere. Eventually its rich energy source allowed eukaryotic cells to emerge, representing a significant leap in biological complexity. These cells contained a nucleus and more sophisticated cellular structures.

This process of growth kept going. Life got ever more complicated. Soon individual cells started to merge into multi-cell organisms. Then each cell inside these lifeforms specialized to perform unique functions. Multi-cellular organisms had cells specialized in an evermore complex organization. Skin cells protected from the elements, muscle cells allowed locomotion, nerve cells enabled intra-organism communication.

As lifeforms kept adding cell specialization, they became more complex and developed what some call anti-fragile—resisting entropy's destructive forces by growing new cells specialized to overcome new challenges.

The Ediacaran Period (635-541 million years ago) marked the emergence of the first complex, soft-bodied organisms. Life was no longer like simple bacteria, but becoming more like animals, featuring basic body plans and the ability to interact with their environment with things like cells that could detect light, the precursor to our modern eyes. These creatures, like the disc-shaped Dickinsonia, represented huge jumps in multicellular life and body complexity.

Now the stage was set.

What came next was called the Cambrian Explosion, where many new creatures emerged displaying increasingly complex body structures, sensory systems, and locomotion capabilities. Now life didn't have to take what it could get.

With an oxygen atmosphere fueling metabolic processes like never before, life could truly get creative with its modeling clay. Life could venture out and find every single place on the game board with energy to harvest regular atoms into biological mass.

Life now had to answer who should stay in the game. The Game of Life needed a score board for its players.

- integrate life turns regular mass to biomass, to increase the field of play, and players.

## Chapter 6—Scoreboard: What Evolution Is, The Editor of Players

<!-- remember Jumanji, ie, that shared problems creates the best of friends, regardless of personal identities. and that is what evolution is editing for, to find the lifeforms capable of being a functioning friend's group/ecosystem -->

You've got the Game of Life at your feet. The pieces look different to you now. The rule book, game board, sand glass, and modeling clay are no longer gifts filled with wonder, but objects animated by the energy of purpose.

You want to play it. Are you ready? Let's press the start button!

Not so fast. Playing isn't winning. Before your venture onto your game board, let's learn what puts creatures on the score board.

Just now you cough. It's so small it almost goes unnoticed like a blink, breath, or other autonomic function. But alarm bells ring now because there's a scratchy pain in your throat.

You know right away. Excitement kept you up too late. With so little sleep your immune system couldn't keep infection at bay. You're sick.

Viruses are tiny, but no different than any other lifeform; they are still bits of clay playing the game. Their strategy is simple; forgo reproductive parts and instead self-replicate by invading another creature and hijacking its cells. It's a winning idea. Animals, plants, even bacteria attracted viruses soon after their games started.

Viruses are so simple they need only a few thousand genes. Humans have three billion for comparison. Even with this difference in size and abilities, your virus got itself on the scoreboard at your expense.

Why?

Modeling clay is a metaphor for genes, which in the real world are made of DNA, or sometimes its simpler precursor, RNA. From eye color to gill size, genes are the chemical blueprints that determine every creature's genetic traits, what scientist call genotype.

But, the score board doesn't give points for genes simply existing. Why would life reward the now? According to the unchangeable arrow of time, the unique, unpredictable, and dangerous future is where life must focus.

That's why the score board counts kids, or how many of todays' genes can get themselves into the future. Usually this means direct offspring, but not necessarily, as many species protect family members via cooperative breeding (wolf packs, human extended families) or eusociality (ant colonies, bee hives). 

The scoreboard values kids no matter how they're supported.

We know the game board always changes and the game clock always ticks away a organism's time. To overcome new challenges, creation of course needs new players. So, procreation obliges with repopulation, but provides something even more valuable. That is because almost all genes do not exactly copy themselves during procreation. Instead there are slight changes, giving each kid unique genes.

Meaning, kids not only repopulate life, but also develop new abilities too.

This is pivotal. We know every time and place in the universe is unique, now we know is every single lifeform too. The Game of Life is about matching the unique requirements of the environment with the unique abilities of a lifeform.

But life cannot do the matching. It loves all its manifestations too much and so uses a coach called evolution. Using natural selection, evolution picks the genes best adapted to play the game by, you guessed it, giving points for each new kid.

And that's how the life's players get chosen.

This strategy works very well against entropy. Not only has life evolved from single-cell organism to populate the planet. It's suffered five mass-extinction at the hands of entropy, and repopulated the planet each time.

Here's why valuing procreation keeps winning the Game of Life.

When encountering the realities of game board and game clock, prioritizing offspring is the best way for life to value energy efficiency. The more kids an organism has, means the more efficiently it harvests energy compared to others. And uses the slight variations of lifeform to evolve new species as needed. 

For example, brown bears are nearly identical to polar bears. They can even interbred. By giving points to offspring, evolution slowly turned brown bears living near the very cold Arctic with lighter coats into polar bears. After enough points (kids), speciation happens, meaning a new bear species is made, one with a white coat, bigger paws, and a taste for seals.

And, with two large bears species playing the game, if the game board gets hotter or colder, life can respond either way.

But life does not want new, or any species, to succeed at any cost. Polar bears eating every seal would not be good for it, or anyone else. Remember life loves all its genes equally and thus wants as many genes having as many kids as possible. That's why evolution selects not selfish star players, but team players who work together to harvest energy more efficiently.

This cooperation happens inside ecosystems, which is a community of plants and animals living in the same area. Ecosystems include climatic conditions, elevation, water levels, and other environmental factors. BBC Planet Earth episodes on tropical rain forests or expansive grasslands showcase Earth's many ecosystems quite well. 

There's only so much energy, usually sunlight but sometimes volcanic heat too, available in an ecosystem, what is called "carry capacity". Every ecosystem is configured to maximize its energy use.

It starts with producers (plants, plankton) who convert energy to biomass. Grazers (deer, bats) who feed on the producers and often spread or fertilize its seed. Predators (lions, bears) who prevent grazers from overgrazing. Decomposers (mushrooms, bacteria) to breakdown the dead to fuel the growth of new plants. And lastly viruses who test everyone for their strength in near real time. This system of checks and balances rewards reciprocation while keeping overpopulation in check.

All the species of an ecosystem share a carrying capacity, have similar game boards and game clocks, and therefore share many like seasonal weather changes, water levels, temperature, sunlight, and geological features. Because each member must reciprocate, they continually increase the conversion of matter into biomass, making an ecosystem an expansive force. No species of an ecosystem can't do this, and therefore can't win, alone.

That's why they're on the same team!

Imagine that, your virus and you are teammates. Evolution knows if this virus proves you are to frail to fight it off, you are perhaps too frail to have or support kids too. The virus reciprocates to the ecosystem by ending the game of one lifeform, so the rest get more energy of the carrying capacity to play the game.

In return for not catching every seal, the polar bears get seals who can hunt, and bring more of the energy of the producers to the kids of the polar bears.

Life must overcome all the forces of nature to sustain its existence. The last lesson of this amazing gift is understanding it's called the Game of Life, not the Game of You. You best play it by reciprocating with your teammates. Outsiders are not bad per se, but they interrupt this system and often, like the chestnut tree, ash tree, orange tree, and many other species are the victim of.

Of course individual creatures do not know this. They are bits of clay already hardened. They are inside the game and cannot stand above it. So, individual creatures fight for survival. Bison bulls fighting to lead a herd, tigers chasing down a deer, venus fly traps capturing a wasp makes for great television.

But it's not the Game of Life, just a minor part of it.

The game is about scoring points by having offspring who stand a good chance of having even more offspring. Kids are literally the future and its why the Game of Life is the perfect Christmas or birthday present.

Now that you know how the rule book, game board, sand clock, modeling clay and scoreboard work together, let's play the game!

Not this game though, but the sequel that's similar in so many ways. Let's win the Game of Technological Life, what we can also call techvolution.

----

- equilibrium
- no lifeform has ever come back.
- natural selection is life's answer to the natural laws. 
- see a ecosystem not as animals fighting for survival, but as biologists do, species working in tandem
- that's what makes species, not just the aerodynamics of birds, but the instinct to breed right in time for spring, etc..
- Kids are the future, and its why you got the Game of Life is the perfect Christmas or birthday present.
- Because life wants genes that can survive in the unique time and place tomorrow brings.
- This virus is an example. It succeeded in finding a host, replicating itself, and so will be in the future. While you may complain, that hot chicken soup you're about to have was once a lifeform, and you're using it to stay alive and keep your genes around to hopefully pass your genes into the future. Hopefully that poultry had kids, or close cousins, before it died for you.
- So, despite being so very different, you and the virus are on the score board together. Why? Because you are on the same functioning team, or as biologist says, ecosystem. If that's hard to imagine, just realize you were chosen by the same coach.

--

But evolution is not searching for star players, ones so good they consume playing time by eradicating others. Even your virus getting you sick does not want to truly harm you, that would be like us burning our farms down.

Life cannot fight itself and win the game. Entropy is its only enemy, for life and therefore all its forms. So, you and the virus are on the same team!


Flowers and bees, squirrels and oak trees. So many species work together to harvest available energy and thereby replant, repopulate a new ecosystem each year. All the while, procreation is the scoreboard, and it makes new species as needed as the arrow of time moves forward. 

Meaning the best way for a genotype to get more children to grow in such a way to harvest energy in a way no creature is yet. This is called the phenotype of a organism and includes everything from a bush growing tall like a tree, or a bird leaning where better fishing grounds are. Ecosystems allow customized creatures to work on a intricate timetable of cooperation.

## Chapter 7—What Does the Game of Life Mean

Before we press start on the Game of Technological Life, there's something to say about the Game of Life.

The game is a relatively accurate way to describe life's time on Earth, but not perfect. Specialists could highlight problems with the metaphor. For starters, when accessed in detail, entropy is much more complex than just "degrading things". Also, the natural laws have many exceptions, especially at the extremes of temperature, velocity, gravity (near black holes, traveling near light speed), so are not truly "universal laws". However, these extremes are rarely a factor for us, and entropy's details don't change its overwhelming tendency to decompose matter. So it's fair to say the booklet of natural laws is all but absolute in our experiences. 

However, we should go into more detail about evolution's selection methods.

Because natural selection isn't the only way life picks genes. Other mechanisms include sexual selection, where females select males for novel traits like tusks or feather color; genetic drift, is when genes change randomly over time; human male pattern baldness is an example, and migration interactions, where species diverge into separate pockets but reintegrate to exchange their genes, polar and brown bears mating to create "hybrid" offspring is a current example.

Co-evolution is another selection mechanism. This happens when one species is intimately linked to the evolution of other species within the same ecosystem. This heavily reciprocal process can lead to the emergence of complex, interdependent communities. Flowering plants and their pollinators, such as bees and butterflies, is a prime example.

Epigenetics is another way to introduce new players, but with an important difference. Epigenetics is like a sophisticated control system for your genes. Imagine your DNA as a vast library, and epigenetic mechanisms are the librarians that decide which books (genes) get read and which remain closed. Genes therefore change how they are expressed, often by parental experiences and traumas. For example Dutch kids born in 1944-45 had increased obesity risk, higher rates of metabolic disorders, and altered insulin regulation as a reaction to their parents malnourishment during World War II. Epigenetics is nature's way of allowing organisms to adapt to their environment without rewriting their entire genetic instruction manual.

Epigenetics is one of the many phenotype characteristics we learned before, these are the observable physical, biochemical, and behavioral characteristics of an organism that result from the interaction between its genotype and the environment. Two acorns growing, one in sunshine, the other in a forest shade, will grow to be two different looking trees, even if having the same genes.

However, life experiences never change genes. The Weismann Barrier and the Central dogma of molecular biology both show acquired knowledge and tribulations never communicate to future generations beyond slight variations in epigenetic inheritance (although some neo-Lamarckian biologists question aspects of these tenants, an example why our definition of natural laws should be open to questions).

So, from the other selection methods, to epigenetics and other phenotype developments, there are many other ways to introduce new genes and variations. However, each and every player must still harvest enough resources to procreate. That's why our "coach" uses natural selection, because it is by far the dominant way evolution validates its players/genes.

So, the natural laws of physics, chemistry, geology, and biology, all have important differences between the Game of Life metaphor and reality, but for our purpose of upgrading our players with a new identity, this game is indeed a valuable gift. 

Because it demonstrates why nature works as it does in the biological world, and so helps us understand the Game of Technological Life we are striving to win.

Happily, we do see many hints of technological evolution.

For starters, we have a historical legacy of using animal products as technological adaptions. A few examples are fur coats, water skins, beasts of labour, carrier pigeons, and hunting dogs, but there are countless others. Harvesting our tools from nature means assessing the strengths and weaknesses of animals and thus being a sort of coach, selecting species to solve specific problems. 

Of course we developed our own tools. From the spears of the Stone Age, to the chisels of the Bronze Age, and all the countless tools since, making and using a specific set of tools is often what defines a person, culture, society, and civilization. Many of our personal names, from Blacksmith (metal working), Cooper (barrel making), Draper (wool weaver), and so many others, show how interwoven tools are with human identities. 

Biology and technology have so much crossover we often design our technologies while looking over the shoulder of nature.

Today, there's even a field called biomimicry; the emulation of natural models, systems, and elements for the purpose of inventing new technologies. Among its many creations is Velcro, copied from the fuzzy seed burs that so easily stick to our clothes during country walks in the grass. Many airplanes, drones, robotics, and other technological designs get their inspiration from the biological products of natural selection.

Biological and technological development crossover so well because they have common problems.

They each need to invent structural engineering (skeletons, framing) to combat gravitational forces, aerodynamics (birds, planes) and hydrodynamics (fish, ships) to move efficiency through air and water, and thermodynamics to keep warm, or cool, in various environments (fur, insulation). We even track biology and technology developments using very similar trees charts. These graphical representations show the evolutionary relationships among various species based upon similarities and differences in their genetic or physical characteristics.

Using the Game of Life metaphor makes it easier to understand why biology and technology crossover so much. They have the same booklet of natural laws, game board, sand clock, and therefore must survive the same attacks from gravity, radiation, mechanical stress, energy loss, evaporation, and other forms of entropy.

We know how biology responds to these challenges, and when was the last time you, or anyone, grew a winter coat of hair to combat Minnesota winters. Do parents ever tell a kid to increase skull bone strength before climbing a mountain. Does anyone create more fat to store water before their long trip.

Of course not.

We see evolution in the natural world but not in our own lives. When watching a struggling polar bear today, we have no problem citing its evolutionary pressure caused by its changing environment. We know the point of contact between the entropy's attacks and biology is a set of genes that a trying to win natural selection's approval. The point of contact between entropy and us is almost always a tool, yet we do not think evolution pressures us as well.

Even with all these indications that we're using technology to survive the Game of Life, few people label themselves as their tool. National, ethnic, gender, job title, education, ideology, religion, racial, sports teams, comic books, all have far more space in our personal identities then the tools we use to stay alive.

That's why this book wants you to embrace being a technological being. Not because it's an interesting idea, but because it make us realize we are playing the Game of Life, and technology is our first line of defense against entropy's endless attacks. 

We realize this truth in the natural world, so should be able to make the leap and understand the truth of our existence by realizing we are simply inside technological version of the Game of Life. Then we can start to knowingly play it and therefore win.

The booklet of rules, game board of environments, sandglass of time, bits of clay, and a scoreboard are all there. As is the circle of producers, grazers, predators, decomposers, and testers in our own ecosystems too. This is happening all around us.

So why don't we see it?

Because our coach is using an unnatural selection method. Picking the team in such a way often clouds our view. Here is a quick story to explain.

There's this crab, Heikegani, that's native to Japan. It's rather small with long legs. It would be another unknown crab except it has an interesting feature. It's shell looks like a human face. In particular, an angry samurai.

Why?

The crabs name gives a clue. Their namesake is the Taira clan who dominated medieval Japan and were commonly known as the Heike. Their warriors fought a massive civil war against the Minamoto clan in 1185.

The five year long war was decided at the massive Dan-no-ura naval Battle in western Japan.

The Heike lost and Minamoto's leader Yoritomo became the first Shōgun, or military ruler, of Japan. This was a cultural and political turning point in Japanese history. For seven centuries Japan was ruled not by emperors, but by samurai warriors and shōguns. Local legend said Heikegani crabs are reincarnations of the Heike warriors defeated at the battle. It is even written in _The Tale of the Heike_, a chronicle of ancient Japanese history.

That's one interpretation for the crab's distinctive feature.

Carl Sagan, the noted American astronomy and educator, says something else. In his book _Cosmos: A Personal Voyage_ Sagan says the Heikegani crabs were caught by local fisherman who occasionally saw faces in the shell. Out of respect for ancient fallen soldiers, the fishermen returned them to the sea, while harvesting the unlucky crabs who didn't carry the spirits of an ancestor. As the years went by more newly hatched crabs had the genes that made their shell look like a face. Eventually, all the Heikegani crabs had what looked like a human face on their shell.

Human beings had selected winning crabs, but for unnatural reasons, which is why the Heike crabs are a classic example of "artificial selection". This is another interpretation for the crab's distinctive feature.

It's not the definitive one, because there's no record of Japanese fisherman ever selecting crabs for human faces. The crab isn't even a staple of any known diets. Evolutionary biologist Joel Martin thinks the crabs distinctive muscles and shell are simply built the way they are because natural selection says it works. Humans only see a face because of human pareidolia; our tendency to impose a meaningful interpretation on patterns, so that we easily detect meaning in places where there is none.

We often do the same in the stars or clouds in the sky, where we see horses, chariots, and endless other objects inside floating water vapor, or balls of gas unimaginably far from each other.

These visions only make sense from our own vantage point. Meaning while playing on the emergent game board and clock in the Game of Technological Life, we are often chasing the shadows of our own psyches.

So, the Heikegani crabs showcases something very important for our winning the game. While all the other selection mechanisms are in effect and helping us develop new tools, we replaced nature's coach with ourselves and used artificial selection to pick our team.

Evolution's seminal book is, of course, Charles Darwin's _On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection_. Most people know the first part, but skip over the second part "by means of natural selection." As the Heikegani crab story highlights we often artificially play the game. This book could well be called "Techvolution: On the Origin Of a Technological Species, by Upgrading Our Error Prone Artificial Selection with the Super Powers of Natural Selection".

And so, to win the Game of Technological Life, we do not need to invent anything new. We already recognize biological evolution, watch and feel for its players, and use and copy its achievements. We already invent and use many amazing tools to harvest resources and protect ourselves from entropy's perils.

We are already playing the game!

To earn a much better score, we need to get out of our heads. 

Happily, we've done this in many other fields, from physics, chemistry, medicine, and geology. What these journeys teach us is there are three ways for humans to understand the Game of Life. By learning the value of nature, mythologies, stories, and science, we will finally adopt technological identity and better outmaneuver entropy in our never ending techvolution.

## Chapter 8—Legacies Never Die

Nature has a lot of meanings. It includes all weather of all kinds, vast open seas, and gorgeous mountain vistas. Nature can also be the forces of nature while still meaning "mother nature's" growth of life itself. The word is an inquiry too. The question "what's the nature of a thing", is asking what are its features that can't be changed.

We're using every part of the word. By updating our identity we're effectively asking what our nature is. And, not for academic reasons, but for the express purpose of returning to it via natural selection.

Nature is a natural fit for us because after all, like everything biological, we're on the tree of life, so it's literally in our genes.

The earliest known human, science calls us Homo (latin for human), is a 2.8 million-year-old specimen from Ethiopia. Thereafter, we evolved into twelve known groups, homo erectus, denisovan, neanderthal, and us homo sapiens are a few. The list grows as more fossil and DNA evidence is discovered.

Human groups often evolved in isolation, but migration interactions meant different humans interbreed to varying degrees. Today 1%-5% of our DNA is from "archaic humans", especially neanderthal and denisovan. This small percentage isn't enough to make a difference, but enough for DNA researches to track our history.

The selection process tested our genes like any anything else living under the stars. Up against the whims of nature, we experienced the entire gauntlet of trials, from cold, heat, hunger, aging, limited resources, and other natural problems in the Game of Life. 

The coach of course responded to this state of nature by trading old for new human adaptations. Easy tree climbing was replaced with the animals kingdoms best endurance running. Full body hair exchanged for mostly hairless skin and sweat (interestingly, almost no other animals sweat). Our vocal tract developed to make increasingly complex sounds. And perhaps the most important, ten fingers was traded for eight fingers and two disposable thumbs.

These trades consistently got more pronounced over time because they earned evermore points on the procreation scoreboard.

With endurance running, sweat, speech, and thumbs, humans held spears and organized themselves to reliably chase, exhaust, kill, and defend protein and calorie rich food. We learned to crave sugar for the rare energy boosts it gave, but being omnivorous, were able find something to eat year round. Growing speech abilities let us communicate more complex ideas and knowledge about the unique challenges of the emergent game board. Crucially, we learned the value of charred meat (likely from scavenging food after brush fires), and started our own fires to cook, and therefore predigest, our food.

All these adaptations made for a increasingly efficient lifeform. So much so, we could afford to keep growing our brains. This most powerful of human adaptations used up so much energy our heads kept its hair to retain some of the heat billions of neurons create.

As most creatures, humans are sexually dimorphic. While females in most species are larger, because eggs are larger and more valuable, in mammals, males are often bigger to win mating rights. Human inherited this feature and so males are typically larger, stronger and more aggressive, while females got higher body fat percentages because childbirth is risky and energy intensive. Human offspring require extended parental care due to their prolonged vulnerability after birth so parents typically mate for life. However, infant mortality, along with lengthy childhoods, means humans must be ready to mate year round to faster replace their lost members.

While human genes had the above in common, we never naturally got along. We formed tribes of a dozen to up to 200 people. We lived with our communities or perished. About 30-60% of ancient humans died at the hands of another. Such was limited carrying capacity and drive for our bits of clay to be picked by the coach.

The branch of homo sapiens formed from this genetic history in Africa about 300,000 years ago. Its not surprising Africa's geography bore modern humans. The naturally isolated landscape made it harder for humans to interact. Thus was a sort of breeding ground for the coach to pick new adaptations. Even today, there is more genetic diversity in sub-saharan Africa then in the rest of the entire world.

The first homo sapiens lived as nomadic hunter-gatherer groups, surviving through community driven hunting, resource gathering, and child rearing. Like most animals we knew hunting and foraging grounds, but had to move across savannas and woodland areas looking for our next meal. The average daily trip was about 10-15 kilometers a day.

At least we had basic stone tools, could craft crude clothes, and were develop complex social structures connected with evermore conversations and gossip. Even though quite primitive compared to today, early homo sapiens adaptable hands, feet, and cognitive skills still allowed them to navigate most any environmental challenge on the African game board.

After millions of years, nature finally created a human who could conquer the world.

There were waves of "out of Africa" homo sapien migrations. With our unique adaptations we got to Eurasia 125,000 years ago, Australia around 65,000 years ago, the Americas about 15,000 years ago, and remote islands such as Hawaii, Easter Island, Madagascar, and New Zealand in the years 300 to 1280. At each place, homo sapiens gradually replaced or interbreed with local populations of archaic humans.

By about 12,000 years ago, most of the archaic humans were effectively gone. Either losing out over resources or interbreeding with homo sapiens to their own extinctions. Now, all humans were homo sapiens using very unique adaptations on nearly every game board Earth has to offer. From north to south, desert to jungle, super cold to very hot, our adaptability let us outpace the sand clock and keep scoring points.

Then, we hit the Neolithic Revolution, the invention of agriculture. 

It occurred independently at different times in the world. First taking root in Southwest Asia Fertile Crescent 11,000 BC, China 9,000 BC, Mesoamerica 5000 BC and others regions afterward. Heavily influenced by the wildlife and resource available, but most locations started permanent human settlements, the domestication of animals, clay pottery, and metal tools. In every instance humans had a relatively stable food supply throughout the year.

As we ponder our long history, please realize something important. We accept that sloths never fight off their enemies, ants are always selfless, elephants consistently love their families. We accept these lessons because we know each creature has its nature. That doesn't mean every individual lifeform is always predictable, but it does mean there are certain characteristics that species have features that can't be changed.

This is because, as the Weismann Barrier and the Central dogma of molecular biology tell us, there is no way for any creature to change its genes. Therefore, homo sapiens love of sugar and sex, tribal loyalty, amazing endurance, sexually dimorphism, warlike behaviors, migration interactions, capacity for good and evil, this is all in our genes and likely always will be our nature to some degree.

Therefore, the legacy of our genetics roots human phenotypes (cultures, beliefs), and extended phenotypes (technology, tools) in the history of our biological evolution. That means tools and technology are bound to the abilities and limitations of homo sapien genetics.

Basically, humans are the soil in which technology grows, or doesn't.

This may be why humans, even within tribes, evolved to be so different. Just the variety of your friends and family to elephants, tigers, apes, or anything else. Our species is so similar in many ways, but we're also very different too.

Physically, we have three main body types, known as somatotypes: ectomorph (slender and lean), mesomorph (muscular and athletic), and endomorph (rounder and softer). Each type has a distinct characteristics related to muscle mass and fat distribution, meaning whether running long distances, digging a hole, or carrying a huge log, we have body types to meet the challenge.

Our intelligence differs too. Levels of abstract thought, practical proficiency, patience to defer gratification, musical abilities, are all quite varied. Some people can recite long histories from their minds, while others can calculate carpentry measurements with ease. All the many millions of products and services in the economy is conceived, designed, manufactured, distributed, and used by a human because humans are so different.

Such huge human variety may caused by our co-evolution with tools. Meaning the technological evolution this books is advocating we embrace, has been driving the change in human genetics to make homo sapiens. Because the Game of Life needs ecosystems of producers, grazers, predators, and testers to win, and the coach picked human communities who had the varied human genetics needed to be able to staff every job in the technological ecosystem.

This job of genotype, phenotype, and extended phenotype is to staff the technological ecosystems producers (farms, power plants), grazers (tool users), predators (innovators), testers (crooks). Like any biological ecosystem, these segments work together to play the game. Producers grow the food or generate the electricity, that will power the technology used by the common person. Predators assess which grazer's tool is not too slow, and innovate a solution which if successful will remove the old tool from the ecosystem. Of course the nefarious testers will always be around to basically randomly test all members for their fitness-something which I learned and dealt with daily as a claims adjuster.

For thousands of years after the Neolithic Revolution, humans powered and manually operated most every tool. Even through with each year they were leaving the natural world behind, they were able to satisfy their calorie and nutritional requirements, make housing, collect fresh water for drink and cleaning. They were no longer just hunting and gather what nature made available, but instead making making and operating a new ecosystem in a modified Game of Life. Diverse human characters, abilities, and natures was chosen by natural selection to man technological ecosystems. 

That means each person has a legacy of genetics that evolved in a time period before civilization. Some paleo-anthropologists describe this time being so formative to our nature that humans are not evolved for modern life. Even so, we were chosen by natural selection to build and staff modern life. Using our inherited biological self-interest we overcame our emergent game board and sand clock, reciprocated enough to achieve the needed calories to survived entropy's attacks, and procreated more kids and tools to build entire technological ecosystems.

With each step, tools emulated life's journey and got more complex, self-sufficient, and self-aware. A virus will never know where it is, it simply performs its function s. A bug can decide where its going. A mammal even more so, and so on. The point it, the longer an ecosystem evolves, it adds more lifeforms with more sensory and therefore more awareness.

This awareness is the root of our bad habit of turning personal self-interest into selecting tools of a different ecosystem. So many generations into technological ecosystem, we need to make modern life more natural by replacing artificial with natural selection. The first step is realizing we are genetic creatures using tools to play a modified version of the Game of Life.

I often wonder how my speech impediment would have changed in earlier times. At least in nomadic times, I think it might have been an advantage. Tracking game, avoiding predators, evading competitors, it might help to be naturally quiet. But as society grew, I likely would have missed out and been explained within the stories of the time as simpleton of some kind.

Of course I don't know this, but I only mean to illustrate a point that the many different personalities, body types, mental abilities, and other characteristics in humans, has genetic roots in people sitting by a fire thousands of years ago, and we carry all these with us today for no other reason that we can't get rid of these ghosts from our past.

Yet, we still must find a way to fit our genetics into the requirements of technological evolution.

The "artificial selection" of our stories allowed us to create a new selection is thus often a matter of these ghosts. This genetic legacy is the source of my artificial selection content, that we find reasons to care about but evolution can't get rid of because its in our genes.

So it's up to us. We can't shake our heritage, but we can improve it with a new identity to remove artificial selection as much as possible and letting nature selection take over. Let's get started.

How did we spread around the world, and how did we develop tools? We plated and spread tool-species inside ecosystems of course. And that required, and still requires, three modes of understanding; nature, mythologies, stories, and science.




- Mitochondrial Eve, in other words, she is defined as the most recent woman from whom all living humans descend in an unbroken line purely through their mothers and through the mothers of those mothers, back until all lines converge on one woman.

















## Chapter 5—The History of Life's Evolution

### Introduction

To understand our place in the story of life, we've been on a journey. The first step was recognizing that the fundamental laws of nature govern the living world's existence. The physical, chemical, and geological processes that have shaped the evolution of life on Earth—from the formation of the planet itself to the cycling of elements and the flow of energy—create the very "gameboard" upon which all organisms, including humans, play on. 

Then we learned about entropy, the sort of nemesis of life. Entropy is the force of nature that drains heat and energy away, forcing life to continually harvest heat, sunlight, and calories to stay alive. With entropy as a constant threat, life employs evolution, whose laws such as speciation, mate choice, and adaptive radiation help create new life forms capable of harvesting energy from every available niche on the gameboard. While each life form is very self-interested and wants to stay alive, together locked inside ecosystems their mutual self-interest serves to keep life adapting, surviving, and thriving.

And it has been a long road with many ups and downs lifes never ending game of evolution. When learning the full history of life's evolution we realize while Earth is constant putting trials and tribulations in the face of every creature. Happily, since Earth has proven so perfect for life's evolution, life slowly turned this planet into a lifeboat.

To further understand life's success, we must drill down into the eras of life's conquest of Earth.

### Geological Time Periods 

According to the laws of evolution, Life changedin tandem with the planet. When Earth would get colder, or hotter, the life forms employed to represent team life would change to accomodate the new requirements. Understanding the history of the Earth is crucial to comprehending the history of life itself. Unfortunately, the ability to travel through time remains elusive, leaving us to piece together the past like investigators at a crime scene—gathering clues and meticulously analyzing them to uncover the full narrative.

Much like the fields of physics, chemistry, and others, humanity has long sought to fill the gaps in its knowledge about the Earth's origins through the prevailing narratives and theories of each era. Humanity's efforts to uncover the age of the planet stretch back centuries, with diverse perspectives emerging across cultures and disciplines. And like before, the tools of the time limited the answers humans could gather.

The classical Greek philosopher Aristotle, for instance, believed that time had no beginning or end, and thus considered the Earth to be infinitely old. In contrast, religious scholars in ancient India envisioned a cyclical universe of perpetual expansion and collapse, calculating the planet's age at a staggering 1.97 billion years.

During the medieval period, Christian theologians turned to the Bible, proposing estimates ranging from 5,471 to 7,519 years, as documented by G. Brent Dalrymple in "The Age of the Earth." In the 17th and 18th centuries, a variety of scientists began to offer alternative figures, drawing upon clues such as the Earth's rate of cooling, the accumulation of sediment, and the chemical evolution of the oceans.

These divergent perspectives highlight the challenge of reconstructing the planet's distant past without the ability to directly observe it. Limited by our biological senses, and primitive technology, we creative minds filled the gaps of knowledge with mythology. Yet, through meticulous investigation and the accumulation of evidence, humanity has steadily chipped away at this mystery, inching closer to a more comprehensive understanding of the Earth's origins and the evolution of life upon it.

Once scientific tools arrived, the true age of our planet and the origins of life have captivated the scientific community. From the early speculations of Archbishop James Ussher, who proposed a mere few thousand years, to the groundbreaking work of geologists like James Hutton and Charles Lyell, who suggested millions of years, the quest to understand the Earth's antiquity has been a long and fascinating journey.

It was not until the pioneering efforts of radiometric dating experts like Ernest Rutherford and Arthur Holmes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that the Earth's age was firmly established at a staggering 4.54 billion years. This remarkable revelation has opened up a world of possibilities, allowing us to delve deeper into the chapters of our planet's history.

Knowing the age of the Earth let humans starting looking at the age of life. The earliest evidence of life dates back to the Archean eon, over 3.5 billion years ago, as discovered by scientists like William Schopf and Elso Barghoorn. These early life forms, likely simple, single-celled organisms akin to modern bacteria and archaea, thrived in the harsh conditions of the young Earth, setting the stage for the remarkable diversification and adaptation that would follow.

As our understanding of the Earth's history has improved, geologists have divided the planet's geological timeline into a series of eras, epochs, and ages, each with its own distinct characteristics and therefore dominant life forms. The pioneering work of scientists like Georges Cuvier, William Smith, and James Hutton laid the foundations for this geological timescale, which was further refined by the efforts of researchers like Charles Lyell, Roderick Murchison, and Adam Sedgwick.

Throughout these geological eras, life has undergone a remarkable process of diversification and adaptation, responding to the ever-changing conditions of the planet. Importantly, life kept expanding its powers as time went by. From the earliest prokaryotes to the complex multicellular organisms of the Cambrian explosion, as documented paleontologists like Charles Darwin, Stephen Jay Gould, and Simon Conway Morris, the history of life on Earth is a testament to resilience and innovation as life proceeds up the gameboard.

Until something goes wrong and life is sent back many squares. The geological record also reveals a series of mass extinction events, periods of rapid and widespread species loss that have dramatically reshaped the course of life on Earth. These events, such as the Permian-Triassic and Cretaceous-Paleogene extinctions, are thought to have been triggered by a variety of factors, including asteroid impacts, as proposed by scientists like Walter Alvarez, and intense volcanic activity suddenly, as studied by researchers like Paul Renne and Gerta Keller.

Together, these discoveries by generations of scientists have transformed our understanding of the Earth's history and the evolution of life. The interplay of physical, chemical, and geological laws remade this planet many times over. As new eras came, evolutionary laws remade life with incredible resilience and adaptability that always reinforced the profound interconnectedness of life forms existence inside ecosystems.

---

The geological time scale is divided into several major eras, periods, and epochs, each representing a distinct chapter in the Earth's 4.6 billion-year history. These time periods are defined by significant changes in the planet's geology, climate, and the evolution of life. These areas act as a label on each of the gameboard for life to evolve on.

**The Precambrian Eon (4.6 billion to 541 million years ago):**
The Precambrian Eon, spanning from the formation of the Earth 4.6 billion years ago to the beginning of the Paleozoic Era 541 million years ago, encompasses the earliest stages of our planet's history. This vast eon is divided into the Hadean, Archean, and Proterozoic eons. During the Hadean, the Earth was still forming, with intense volcanic activity and meteorite bombardment. The Archean saw the emergence of the first single-celled organisms, likely primitive bacteria and archaea, as well as the formation of the first continents. In the Proterozoic, oxygen levels in the atmosphere increased, allowing for the evolution of more complex eukaryotic cells, or organisms whose cells have a membrane-bound nucleus, and the first multicellular organisms.

**The Paleozoic Era (541 to 252 million years ago):**
The Paleozoic Era, from 541 to 252 million years ago, is divided into the Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, and Permian periods. The Cambrian explosion saw the rapid diversification of marine life, including the first appearance of many major animal phyla, or branches on the tree of life. During the Ordovician and Silurian, the first plants and arthropods (creatures with shells) colonized the land while marine life continued to diversify. The Devonian is known as the "Age of Fishes" due to the proliferation of various fish species. The Carboniferous saw the development of the first large, tree-like plants, as well as the emergence of the first amphibians and reptiles. The Permian-Triassic mass extinction, the largest in Earth's history, wiped out up to 96% of all species, paving the way for the rise of the dinosaurs in the Mesozoic.

**The Mesozoic Era (252 to 66 million years ago):**
The Mesozoic Era, from 252 to 66 million years ago, is divided into the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods. The Triassic saw the rise of the first dinosaurs, as well as the emergence of the first mammals and the first flowering plants. The Jurassic is known for the dominance of large, iconic dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus, Brachiosaurus, and Stegosaurus. The Cretaceous period witnessed the continued evolution and diversification of dinosaurs, as well as the first birds and the rise of modern flowering plants. The Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction, caused by a large asteroid impact, wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs and paved the way for the rise of mammals in the Cenozoic.

**The Cenozoic Era (66 million years ago to present):**
The Cenozoic Era, spanning from 66 million years ago to the present day, marks one of the most remarkable transformations in the history of life on Earth—truly the "Age of Mammals." Following the catastrophic extinction event that claimed the dinosaurs, mammals seized their evolutionary moment with extraordinary opportunism and adaptability. This era unfolds across three distinct periods, each telling its own chronicle of mammalian innovation and diversification.

The Paleogene (66-23 million years ago) witnessed an explosive radiation of mammals into vacant ecological niches. In the wake of the dinosaurs' disappearance, small, primarily nocturnal mammals rapidly diversified into an astonishing array of forms. Early horses no larger than house cats (Eohippus) trotted through prehistoric forests, while Ambulocetus, an early whale ancestor similar to todays hippopotamus, still walked on land with webbed feet. The first primates emerged, with Plesiadapis and its descendants developing the grasping hands and enhanced vision that would later prove crucial to primate evolution. Perhaps most remarkably, we see the emergence of entirely new mammalian body plans—from the first hoofed mammals (condylarths) to the bizarre Uintatherium with its multiple horns and saber-teeth.

The Neogene Period (23-2.6 million years ago) represents the refinement of mammalian diversity into forms more familiar to modern eyes. Grasslands expanded globally, driving the evolution of grazing adaptations—horses developed high-crowned teeth for processing tough vegetation, while early elephants (gomphotheres) experimented with various trunk and tusk configurations. The great apes diverged from other primates, with Proconsul and its descendants giving rise to the lineages that would become today's gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans. This period also saw the rise of fearsome predators like Amphicyon (bear-dogs) and Smilodon (saber-toothed cats), driving prey species to develop increasingly sophisticated defensive adaptations.

The Quaternary Period (2.6 million years ago to present) brought dramatic climate oscillations that tested mammalian adaptability to its limits. During the Pleistocene, massive ice sheets repeatedly advanced and retreated, creating a dynamic patchwork of ecosystems. This era saw the reign of spectacular megafauna—woolly mammoths traversed the mammoth steppe, giant ground sloths towered over South American forests, and cave bears dwarfed their modern relatives. Meanwhile, our own genus, Homo, emerged and diversified, with multiple human species coexisting across the Old World. The Holocene, our current epoch, has witnessed the rise of modern humans as a global force, sadly coinciding with the extinction of many of the Pleistocene's most impressive mammals.

This mammalian success story showcases evolution's remarkable ability to produce stunning diversity from humble beginnings. From the tiniest shrews to the mightiest whales, from the most specialized alpine pikas to the most adaptable primates, mammals have evolved to inhabit virtually every environment on Earth, demonstrating an unprecedented range of adaptations in body size, diet, locomotion, and social behavior. The Cenozoic truly stands as a testament to the power of evolutionary innovation and adaptation in the face of environmental challenges.

These broad geological time periods provide a framework for understanding the evolution of life on Earth, as each era saw the emergence of new life forms, the diversification of existing species, and the occasional catastrophic events that reshaped the planet's ecosystems. By studying the fossil record and the geological evidence from these time periods, scientists can piece together the epic saga of life's triumph over entropy.

And in the present day, as humanity grapples with the profound challenges of today, life's eternal struggle against entropy rages on. From the deepest ocean trenches to the highest mountain peaks, life persists, ever-adapting, ever-evolving, in a relentless quest to outpace the relentless march of disorder. For as long as the Earth endures, this epic saga will continue, life's flickering flame ever-defiant in the face of entropy's cold, unyielding embrace.

Throughout the geological history of the planet, these dynamic changes in the Earth's surface, atmosphere, and climate have presented a constantly shifting "gameboard" for life to navigate. The organisms that have been able to adapt and evolve in response to these geological challenges have been the ones that have thrived and diversified, while those unable to keep pace have often succumbed to extinction.

In this way, the evolving geology of the Earth has been a powerful force shaping the course of life's epic saga, pushing organisms to continuously innovate and diversify in order to maintain their foothold in the ever-changing natural world.

### History of Paleontology

If geology is the study of Earth as it once was, paleontology is the study of life as it once was. The field is the scientific study of prehistoric life, focusing on the analysis of fossils and the organisms they represent. The primary purpose of this field is to reconstruct the history of life on Earth, tracing the evolution of species and the changes that have occurred over vast stretches of geological time, from the start to about 12,000 years ago.

The origins of paleontology can be traced back to the 18th and 19th centuries, when the systematic study of fossils began to emerge as a distinct scientific discipline. Early pioneers, such as Georges Cuvier and Charles Lyell, laid the foundations for the field by recognizing the importance of fossils in understanding the Earth's history and the processes of biological evolution.

As the field of paleontology developed, researchers began to employ increasingly sophisticated techniques and technologies to study fossils. The use of radiometric dating, for example, has allowed paleontologists to accurately determine the age of fossil specimens, while advances in microscopy and analytical chemistry have enabled the detailed examination of the internal structures and chemical compositions of fossils.

The contributions of paleontology to our understanding of life on Earth are immense. By studying the fossil record, paleontologists have been able to reconstruct the evolutionary histories of various organisms, tracing the emergence and diversification of major groups, such as vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants. This has provided invaluable insights into the processes of adaptation, speciation, and extinction that have shaped the development of life over billions of years.

Moreover, paleontological research has shed light on the dramatic changes in the Earth's climate and environment that have occurred throughout its history. The discovery of mass extinction events, such as the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction that wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs, has helped scientists understand the profound impact that environmental upheavals can have on the biosphere.

By piecing together the fragments of the fossil record, paleontologists have also been able to reconstruct the ancient ecosystems and habitats that once existed on our planet. This has allowed for a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between organisms and their environments, as well as the ways in which these relationships have evolved over time.

In recent decades, the field of paleontology has continued to evolve, with the integration of new technologies, such as 3D imaging and computational modeling, enabling even more detailed and sophisticated analyses of fossil specimens. As our understanding of the past continues to grow, paleontology remains a vital and dynamic field of scientific inquiry, shedding light on the rich and diverse history of life on Earth. On our stufy to understand technological evolution in our status of inside it, there is one crucial lesson to learn. That is what happens to life during tranistions from one age to the next.

### Climax of Each Era—Transitions

The geological timeline is divided into eras. Each era is relatively calm, thus life could evolve to its surroundings ever expanding its reach, number, and diversity. But all eras come to an end, and the transitions between the major geological eras were often marked by significant upheaval and dramatic changes that tested the resilience of life on Earth. As one era came to a close and the next began, life forms faced a variety of challenges stemming from shifts in the physical, chemical, geological, and biological environments.

One of the most well-known examples is the Permian-Triassic mass extinction, which occurred at the boundary between the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras, around 252 million years ago. This event, often referred to as the "Great Dying," was the largest mass extinction in Earth's history, wiping out up to 96% of all species. The causes were likely a combination of factors, including massive volcanic eruptions, climate change, ocean acidification, and the depletion of oxygen in the oceans.

The physical environment underwent dramatic changes, with global temperatures fluctuating wildly and sea levels rising and falling. Geologically, the supercontinent Pangaea was beginning to break apart, altering the distribution of land and sea. Chemically, the atmosphere and oceans experienced significant shifts, with changes in the levels of greenhouse gases, oxygen, and other key elements.

These drastic environmental changes proved devastating for many of the dominant life forms of the Paleozoic, such as the trilobites, which went extinct, and the large, predatory amphibians and early reptiles, which were severely impacted. However, the upheaval also created opportunities for new life forms to emerge and thrive. The Triassic period saw the rise of the first dinosaurs, as well as the first mammals and the first flowering plants, setting the stage for the "Age of Dinosaurs" in the Mesozoic.

Similarly, the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event, which occurred around 66 million years ago and wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs, paved the way for the rise of mammals in the Cenozoic. This transition was marked by dramatic changes in the physical environment, including the impact of a large asteroid, as well as shifts in the chemical composition of the atmosphere and oceans. Geologically, the continents continued to drift, and the global climate underwent significant cooling.

These periods of transition between eras were critical moments in the history of life on Earth, testing the adaptability and resilience of life forms and ultimately shaping the course of evolution. The ability of certain species to survive and thrive in the face of such dramatic changes was a testament to the remarkable diversity and adaptability of life on our planet.

Lastly, if you think of life as a story. Each era is a chapter, and the transition from one chapter to the next is the climax. it is when life forms are truly put to the test, and evolution decides which forms are going to survive to the next age. The times get most tough for life when the gameboard changes it environment so fast that its not certain if enough creatures will keep up to sustain the ecosystems they need to survive.

Life's evolution reveals a fascinating pattern: periods of extinction often create opportunities for new, more adaptable life forms to emerge and flourish. This story of resilience and innovation spans billions of years. In summary 

The Precambrian Eon, laid the foundation for all future life. Early innovations included photosynthesis by cyanobacteria and the emergence of complex cells with specialized components. The revolutionary development of multicellularity around 1.5 billion years ago enabled organisms to develop specialized functions, marking a crucial step toward greater complexity.

The Paleozoic Era saw life venture onto land. Plants evolved vascular systems and seeds, while animals developed hard shells, lungs, and amniotic eggs. These adaptations freed organisms from their dependence on aquatic environments and opened new possibilities for terrestrial life.

During the Mesozoic Era, dinosaurs dominated Earth. This period saw the emergence of advanced flight capabilities, sophisticated predator-prey relationships, and the first flowering plants. Meanwhile, early mammals developed enhanced metabolic efficiency, though they remained relatively small and mostly nocturnal.

The Cenozoic Era began with the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs, creating opportunities for mammals to diversify and thrive. Mammals evolved remarkable adaptations, including advanced brains, complex social behaviors, and sophisticated parental care strategies. This era culminated in the emergence of humans, bringing unprecedented advances in tool use, problem-solving, and cultural development.

Throughout these periods, life has faced constant pressure to evolve or perish. Geological and climate changes are inevitable, forcing species to either adapt to new conditions or face extinction. The pain of hunger drives more efficient feeding strategies; the pain of cold drives better insulation; the pain of injury drives enhanced immune responses. There is no escape from these pressures—they are intrinsic to life itself.

Modern species are the survivors of countless evolutionary trials, their bodies and behaviors shaped by the need to avoid pain and death. Even now, evolution continues its relentless work, eliminating individuals and species that cannot adapt to changing conditions. Climate change, habitat destruction, and other anthropogenic pressures create new sources of environmental stress, forcing species to evolve or perish.

This harsh reality drives evolution forward—there is no escape from the pain of adaptation, only the opportunity to evolve more effective responses to life's fundamental challenges. The history of life on Earth is thus not just a story of increasing complexity and diversity, but a testament to the ongoing struggle to avoid pain and death through adaptation. Each species alive today represents a successful lineage in this endless challenge, carrying forward the accumulated solutions of billions of years of evolution.

### Chapter Summary

The epic story of life's evolution on Earth reveals a profound truth: all species exist in a constant struggle against entropy—the universal tendency toward disorder and decay. It is entropy that necessitates the continuous harvest of energy for survival, creating the endless cycle of hunger, thirst, and death. All living things must ceaselessly work against this fundamental force of physics, gathering and consuming energy just to maintain their organized existence against the relentless pull toward disorder.

The pain that drives evolution—hunger, thirst, cold, heat, and ultimately death—are all manifestations of entropy's unyielding grip on life. Evolution, through natural selection, mercilessly eliminates those who fail to effectively harvest and utilize energy, preserving only those traits that help organisms better resist entropy's march toward dissolution. This cosmic battle against disorder has shaped every adaptation, every survival strategy, and every evolutionary innovation.

The geological record reveals a dynamic landscape where the "gameboard" of the Earth has been in constant flux, presenting life with never-ending challenges to its energy-gathering systems. These changes in geological time periods are inevitable and unavoidable, forcing all species to either adapt their energy-harvesting strategies or face entropic death. From the earliest photosynthetic bacteria to modern complex organisms, life has developed increasingly sophisticated methods to capture and utilize energy, yet can never escape the fundamental need to continuously feed on negative entropy to survive.

Through natural selection, speciation, and adaptive radiation, organisms have continuously adapted their energy-gathering and conservation strategies. Each adaptation—from the development of efficient metabolisms to complex hunting behaviors—represents a new solution to the eternal problem of entropy. The fossil record chronicles this ongoing saga, documenting both the victims who failed in their battle against entropy and the survivors who found new ways to maintain their ordered existence.

As we face the profound challenges of the Anthropocene, we are reminded that even our technological civilization remains subject to entropy's laws. While we've developed unprecedented abilities to harvest and utilize energy, we cannot escape the fundamental requirement to continuously gather negative entropy to maintain our complex systems against decay.

This brings us to our current era of technological evolution, where we observe these same patterns playing out in our technological systems. Just as biological systems must maintain themselves against entropy, our technological creations require constant energy input and maintenance to prevent their decay into disorder. Through studying geological time periods and paleontology, we've confirmed that the battle against entropy is the defining feature of both biological and technological evolution.

The story of life is thus not merely one of adaptation and survival, but a four-billion-year struggle against the universe's tendency toward disorder. Every living thing, from the simplest bacterium to the most complex technological system, exists in a state of constant rebellion against entropy, paying for its ordered existence with a perpetual need to harvest energy from its environment. This fundamental truth underlies all the pain and death that drives evolution forward, reminding us that life itself is an island of order in a cosmic sea of chaos.

This brings us to our current era of technological evolution. Through studying geological time periods and paleontology, we've confirmed the scientific exactness of evolutionary principles—principles that we can now observe in technological development. As technological beings, we continue to evolve and adapt, though now we do so not just through biological means, but through technological innovation as well. Yet even with all our advancement, we remain subject to the fundamental drivers of evolution: the need to avoid pain and death in an ever-changing environment.

## Chapter 6—Our History From Trees to Fire

### Introduction

To truly understand our place in the story of life, we embarked on a journey of discovery—one that takes us deep into the fundamental laws of nature that govern the existence of the living world. The physical, chemical, and geological processes that have shaped the evolution of life on Earth, from the formation of the planet itself to the cycling of elements and the flow of energy, have created the very "gameboard" upon which all organisms, including humans, must play.

It can be tempting for us, as a highly intelligent and technologically advanced species, to view ourselves as somehow separate from or above the natural forces that shape the lives of other creatures. Our ability to craft intricate narratives and believe in our own exceptionalism can obscure the reality that, at our core, we are just another organism playing on the same "gameboard" as the rest of life.

Entropy steals our resources, and as it does for anyone else. The search for warmth, cool, shelter, and nutrients drives our choices. No amount of ideological posturing, talented storytelling, or even technological prowess can exempt us from the fundamental laws of nature that govern the living world. We may have mapped, studied, and changed the world, but its still very much a lifeboat to us too.

By accepting we are just another creatures, we can gain a fresh perspective—one that roots our understanding of the human condition in the unchanging requirements of life on Earth. By grounding our political, economic, and social choices in the requirement to overcome entropy, we can find a constant reference, a "north star" to guide us towards more sustainable and harmonious ways of living.

To reach this new understanding, we continue our journey by tracing humanity's first steps in the ongoing saga of life's evolution. It is another of the recurring storyline on how living organisms, starting from humble beginnings, continually expands their reach, enhances their senses, and utilizes their environments in the relentless pursuit of information that will guide adaptations. The steps of humanity's early evolution are the same. Bound by the same laws of evolution applied, early humanity ventured out into the world, increase its diveristy and its adaptations powers to harvest resources and be more self-sufficient.

Knowing evolution of early humanity tells us much about ourselves. These same requirements molded humans to give us the physiques and psychologies we have today. This new branch of the tree of life started when a life form left the trees and learned to walk.

- so humans have the same requirement to pass on their genes and continue their adaptations. If early man was going to survive down from the trees, what did they need to evolve to capture their niche and pass on their genes/adaptation?

### How We Started—Paleoantropology

The evolutionary journey of our hominin ancestors is a tale of resilience, adaptation, and the relentless drive to survive and thrive in the ever-changing landscapes of our planet. The roots of this saga can be traced back millions of years, to the emergence of the first hominins—the group of primates that would eventually give rise to modern humans.

The earliest known hominin fossils date back to the Miocene epoch, around 6-7 million years ago, when our ancestors diverged from the chimpanzee lineage. These early hominins, such as Sahelanthropus and Orrorin, were still largely arboreal, adapted to life in the trees of the African forests.

It was not until the Pliocene epoch, around 4-5 million years ago, that we see the first signs of the bipedal locomotion that would become a defining characteristic of the hominin lineage. Australopithecus, a genus of early hominins, began to venture out of the forests and onto the open savannas, using their upright gait to navigate the changing landscapes.

As the early hominins began to venture out of the forest canopy and onto the open savannas, a remarkable adaptation took place—the transition from an arboreal, tree-dwelling lifestyle to a more terrestrial, ground-dwelling one. This shift in locomotion, from swinging through the trees to walking upright on two legs, was a pivotal moment in the evolutionary history of our ancestors.

The development of bipedalism, or the ability to walk on two legs, was a significant advantage in the changing environments of the Pliocene epoch. By freeing up their hands and allowing for a more efficient means of covering long distances, bipedalism enabled the early hominins to explore a wider range of resources across the savanna landscapes.

The transition to bipedalism brought about important changes in the structure and function of the hands and feet. As our ancestors began to rely less on their hands for locomotion and more for tool-making and manipulation, the hands evolved to become more dexterous and specialized. Meanwhile, the feet became more adapted for efficient, long-distance walking and running.

Today it may seem incredible, but the human body is a high performance machine.

This newfound ability to run for extended periods, a trait known as persistence hunting, was a crucial adaptation that allowed our ancestors to track and pursue prey across the vast savannas. The increased demands on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems during long-distance running drove the development of a more efficient cooling system, leading to the loss of most of the body hair that had previously provided insulation.

The shedding of excess body hair was an important adaptation that enabled our ancestors to better regulate their body temperature during the physical demands of long-distance running. By reducing the amount of insulating fur, the hominins were able to dissipate heat more effectively, allowing them to maintain a high level of physical activity for extended periods without overheating.

This adaptation, combined with the development of sweating and the ability to regulate body temperature through evaporative cooling, was a critical factor in the success and expansion of the hominin lineage across the diverse environments of Africa and beyond. As our ancestors became more adept at persistence hunting and covering vast distances, this suite of physiological and anatomical changes gave them a significant advantage over their competitors.

The human body can run marathons. Other animals are adapted for relatively short bursts of speed. Using spears, a band of humans can chase and exhaust prey.

The transitions from an arboreal to a terrestrial lifestyle, the specialization of the hands and feet, and the loss of body hair all played crucial roles in shaping the evolutionary trajectory of the hominin lineage. These adaptations allowed our ancestors to thrive in the changing landscapes of the Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs, setting the stage for the remarkable diversification and eventual emergence of Homo sapiens as the dominant hominid species.

These adaptations, along with the development of larger brains and more sophisticated tool use, set the stage for the remarkable diversification and evolution of our ancestors.

As the Pleistocene epoch dawned, around 2.6 million years ago, the hominin family tree began to branch out in earnest. Genera such as Homo, Paranthropus, and Australopithecus coexisted, each with their own unique adaptations and survival strategies. The emergence of the genus Homo, with its larger brain size and more advanced tool-making capabilities, marked a significant turning point in the story of human evolution.

The Homo lineage, which includes our own species, Homo sapiens, underwent a series of dramatic transformations and migrations, as our ancestors spread out across Africa and eventually into Eurasia. The discovery of fossils like Homo erectus, Homo neanderthalensis, and Homo sapiens has provided invaluable insights into the physical and cultural evolution of our species, as we adapted to a wide range of environments and developed increasingly sophisticated technologies and social structures.

Throughout this epic saga, the hominin lineage has faced numerous challenges and obstacles, from climate change and environmental upheavals to competition with other hominins and the threat of extinction. Yet, time and again, our ancestors have proven their resilience, using their ingenuity, adaptability, and sheer determination to overcome these challenges and continue the relentless march of human evolution.

### How Human Society Formed

The story of our ancestors' social evolution absolutely fascinating. Let us go take you back to the dawn of human society, when our species first began to form the social bonds that together would see us grow from small bands in East Africa to dominating the planet.

Around 300,000 years ago, when Homo sapiens first emerged in the warm cradle of Africa, our ancestors began an extraordinary journey of social development. The earliest human societies were intimate affairs—small, mobile bands of 20 to 50 individuals, bound together by kinship and necessity. These were not just random groupings, but intricately woven communities where every member played a vital role in the group's survival. Picture a typical day: hunters coordinating their movements with subtle hand signals, gatherers sharing their knowledge of edible plants, children learning vital skills through play and observation, and elders passing down accumulated wisdom around evening fires.

What makes this period so remarkable is the emergence of truly cooperative living. Unlike other species, our ancestors developed sophisticated systems of food sharing, collective child-rearing, and mutual support. These were not just practical arrangements; they were the foundation of human social bonds. The archaeological evidence tells us a compelling story—shared hearths, communal living spaces, and tools that required multiple hands to make and use. This was not just survival; it was the birth of human society as we know it.

As we move forward in time, roughly 70,000 years ago, something extraordinary began to happen. These small bands started developing complex networks with other groups, creating a web of social connections that stretched across vast territories. We see evidence of this in the archaeological record—distinctive shells from coastal regions found hundreds of miles inland technical innovations spreading rapidly across continents, and artistic styles shared across vast distances. These were not just trades of goods; they were exchanges of ideas, beliefs, and innovations that accelerated human development.

The sophistication of these early societies shouldn't be underestimated. They developed intricate social structures without formal hierarchy, making decisions through consensus and respecting expertise rather than inherited status. They created complex tools, developed artistic expression through cave paintings and figurines, and most importantly, they laid the groundwork for human language—perhaps our most remarkable achievement. Around their fires, they shared stories, planned hunts, resolved conflicts, and dreamed up new possibilities.

What's particularly fascinating is how these social innovations allowed our species to adapt to virtually every environment on Earth. The same basic social structure—the small, cooperative band—proved remarkably flexible, enabling humans to survive in the frozen Arctic and scorching deserts alike. This was not just about physical adaptation; it was about cultural solutions to environmental challenges, shared and refined through social learning.

The legacy of these first human societies continues to influence us today. The human need for social bonding, our capacity for cooperation, our drive to share knowledge, and our ability to form networks beyond our immediate group—all these fundamental aspects of human nature were forged in those early communities. When I examine archaeological sites from this period, I'm not just looking at ancient campsites and tool scatters; I'm seeing the birthplace of human society, the crucible in which our social nature was formed.

As we face modern challenges that require unprecedented levels of global cooperation, understanding how our ancestors built the first human societies becomes more relevant than ever. They showed us that cooperation, not competition, was the key to human success. They proved that small groups could maintain connections across vast distances, sharing innovations and solving problems collectively. Most importantly, they demonstrated that human societies could be both incredibly resilient and remarkably adaptable—a lesson we would do well to remember today.

This narrative of our social origins continues to evolve as we uncover new evidence, but the fundamental story remains clear: we are, and have always been, creatures of community, shaped by our ability to form meaningful social bonds and work together for common goals. it is a heritage we carry in every aspect of our modern lives, even if we don't always recognize it.

### How Communities Made Choices

Early human communities operated under what anthropologists call "reverse dominance hierarchy" or egalitarian systems. Unlike the strict hierarchies seen in other primate species, early humans developed mechanisms to prevent any individual from gaining too much power. This system evolved over hundreds of thousands of years and represented a unique approach to social organization that differed markedly from the hierarchical structures that would emerge later in human history.

Leadership in these communities was typically situational rather than permanent. Different individuals might lead different activities based on their expertise and experience. For example, someone might lead a hunting expedition because of their tracking skills, while another person might lead gathering expeditions due to their knowledge of plant locations. This flexible leadership system meant that power was distributed rather than concentrated in a single individual, allowing the community to benefit from diverse expertise and preventing the consolidation of authority.

Decision-making was largely consensus-based, with major decisions affecting the whole group typically discussed collectively and all adult members having a voice. This process, while potentially time-consuming, ensured that decisions had broad community support and took advantage of the group's collective wisdom. Archaeological evidence of communal meeting spaces and circular settlement patterns supports this interpretation of collective decision-making. The enforcement of decisions relied more on social pressure than on physical force, with communities developing sophisticated systems of social control that included gossip and criticism, public ridicule of individuals who tried to dominate others, collective resistance to anyone attempting to assert too much authority, and temporary or permanent ostracism for severe violations of community norms.

Status within these early societies was earned through competence and generosity rather than through force or intimidation. Leaders gained influence by demonstrating skill in important activities, wisdom in decision-making, generosity in sharing resources, ability to build consensus, and success in mediating disputes. The community maintained its egalitarian social structure through several mechanisms, including food sharing requirements that prevented wealth accumulation, mobility that made it difficult to accumulate material possessions, marriage and kinship practices that created networks of mutual obligation, and rituals and customs that reinforced group cohesion and equality.

Conflict resolution typically involved public discussion of grievances, mediation by respected community members, and an emphasis on restoring harmony rather than punishment. Groups had the option to split if conflicts became unresolvable, which served as a final mechanism for maintaining social peace. Gender roles in decision-making were more complex than previously thought. While there might have been some division in the types of decisions each gender typically made, evidence suggests that both men and women had significant input in community decisions. Women often had substantial influence through their control over food distribution, knowledge of crucial resources, social networks, and child-rearing responsibilities.

The size of the community played a crucial role in how decisions were made. Most early human groups maintained numbers (typically 25-50 individuals) that allowed for face-to-face interaction and consensus building. When groups grew too large, they would often split into smaller units that could maintain these egalitarian decision-making processes. Changes in this system began to occur with the development of food storage and agriculture, increased population density, the emergence of private property, and the development of more permanent settlements.

This early system of community decision-making was remarkably successful, as evidenced by its persistence for most of human history and its continued presence in some hunter-gatherer societies today. It demonstrates that humans are capable of maintaining social order without rigid hierarchies or centralized authority, through complex social mechanisms that promote cooperation and prevent the concentration of power. Understanding this history challenges our assumptions about the "naturalness" of hierarchy and suggests that humans have the capacity for multiple forms of social organization, each suited to different environmental and social conditions.

### Fire

The mastery of fire stands as one of the most transformative achievements in human evolution. Archaeological evidence suggests that early humans first began controlling fire approximately 1 million years ago, with the earliest conclusive evidence dating back to 780,000 years ago in caves across South Africa and Israel. Early hominins, likely Homo erectus, would have initially encountered fire through natural occurrences such as lightning strikes or volcanic activity. What began as cautious observation eventually developed into one of humanity's most powerful tools.

The transition from merely using natural fire to actively controlling it marked a crucial turning point in human development. Through careful observation and experimentation, early humans learned to maintain and transport fire, though the ability to create it from scratch would come much later. The archaeological record reveals ancient hearths, charred animal bones, and heat-treated stone tools, all painting a picture of increasingly sophisticated fire use over hundreds of thousands of years.

The impact of fire mastery on early human societies was profound and far-reaching. Cooking emerged as one of its most revolutionary applications, fundamentally changing human biology and evolution. The process of cooking made food easier to digest, eliminated harmful bacteria, and significantly increased the caloric yield from both meat and plant materials. This nutritional revolution had direct implications for human evolution, particularly in brain development. The human digestive system eventually evolved to become smaller compared to other primates, adapting specifically to a diet of cooked, more easily digestible foods.

Fire transformed social structures by creating a central gathering point for early human groups. As darkness fell, the hearth became the nucleus of community life, providing light and warmth that extended social interactions well into the night. These extended periods of social gathering likely played a crucial role in the development of language and complex social behaviors. The communal fireplace became a space for sharing knowledge, telling stories, and strengthening social bonds—activities that would prove essential to human cultural development.

The technological implications of fire mastery were equally significant. Early humans learned to use fire as a tool for improving their hunting and gathering equipment. They discovered that heating stone tools made them stronger and more effective, while wooden spears could be hardened in the flames to create more durable weapons. Archaeological evidence of heat-treated tools, dating back to 164,000 years ago, demonstrates the sophisticated understanding these early humans had developed of fire's transformative properties.

Fire also proved crucial in enabling human migration and adaptation to new environments. By providing warmth in cold climates, early humans could expand their territory into Europe and Asia, regions that would have been uninhabitable without fire's protective heat. Furthermore, fire offered security against predators, making it possible to explore and settle in previously dangerous territories. This environmental adaptation capabilities fundamentally changed the course of human migration and settlement patterns.

The health benefits of fire use were substantial and far-reaching. Cooking made food safer by eliminating parasites and harmful bacteria, while also making tough foods edible and improving the nutritional value of many plants. Archaeological evidence from burned animal bones suggests that early humans were regularly cooking meat by at least 400,000 years ago, indicating an understanding of fire's preservation and food preparation benefits.

The mastery of fire represents more than just technological advancement—it catalyzed a series of biological, social, and cognitive changes that would define human evolution. From the development of larger brains supported by improved nutrition, to the emergence of complex social structures centered around the hearth, fire played an integral role in shaping human society. Modern humans carry this legacy forward, their very biology and social structures still bearing the imprint of that ancient yet revolutionary discovery. The control of fire stands as a testament to human ingenuity and adaptation, marking one of the most crucial steps in the journey of human evolution. 

Before fire, humanitys tools were nothing more than could be found and made using raw materials of nature. After fire, mankind could cook tools like chef who can turn nature's raw materials into a limitless menu.

### Tools—Life's Novel Adaptations

The journey of early human tool-making began long before metallurgy, in an era when our ancestors first learned to manipulate fire to enhance their primitive tools. Through archaeological evidence, we can trace how the mastery of fire revolutionized tool creation during the earliest periods of human technological development.

The first tools were simple stones and wooden implements, but the discovery and control of fire changed everything. Early humans found that carefully applying heat to wood could harden its tip, creating more durable spears and digging tools. This discovery, dating back hundreds of thousands of years, marked humanity's first steps in using fire to transform raw materials into more effective tools. These fire-hardened wooden spears have been found at archaeological sites worldwide, demonstrating how this fundamental technology spread among early human populations.

Stone tool making underwent a dramatic transformation once humans learned to use fire in the manufacturing process. By heating certain types of stone before working them, early toolmakers discovered they could more easily shape them into desired forms. This heat-treatment process, dating back at least 164,000 years, made the stone more amenable to flaking and produced sharper, more durable edges. Evidence of this can be seen in archaeological sites where heat-treated tools show distinctive color changes and improved flaking patterns compared to untreated tools.

Fire also enabled early humans to create composite tools—implements combining different materials. They learned to use heated tree resins and natural adhesives to attach stone points to wooden shafts, creating more effective hunting weapons and tools. The heat from fires helped soften these natural adhesives, making them more pliable and stronger when cooled. This innovation significantly expanded the toolkit of early humans, allowing them to create more specialized and efficient tools for different purposes.

The control of fire also led to innovations in tool maintenance and repair. Stone tools could be refreshed and resharpened using heat treatment, extending their useful life. This ability to maintain and improve existing tools represented a significant advance in human technology and resource management. Archaeological evidence shows that some stone tools were repeatedly heated and reworked, indicating our ancestors' understanding of fire's transformative properties and their ability to use it for tool maintenance.

Beyond direct tool making, fire provided light and warmth that extended the hours during which tools could be made and refined. This additional time for tool production and modification allowed for greater experimentation and improvement in tool-making techniques. The communal space around fires became workshops where knowledge could be shared and skills passed down through generations, leading to continuous improvements in tool-making technology.

The impact of fire on early tool making extended to the creation of specialized areas for tool production. Archaeological sites show evidence of dedicated hearths where tools were made and maintained, suggesting organized approaches to tool manufacturing. These early workshops, identified by concentrations of stone chips, burned tools, and charcoal, provide insight into how our ancestors organized their tool-making activities around the controlled use of fire.

Perhaps most significantly, the use of fire in tool making represented one of humanity's first steps in deliberately transforming materials to create something new. This conceptual leap—understanding that fire could change the properties of materials to make them more useful—laid the groundwork for all future technological developments. It demonstrated early humans' growing cognitive ability to observe, experiment, and adapt their environment to meet their needs.

These early innovations in fire-based tool making were revolutionary for their time, allowing early humans to become more efficient hunters and gatherers, to process food more effectively, and to better defend themselves against predators. The tools they created using fire helped them adapt to diverse environments and ultimately spread across the globe. This mastery of fire in tool production represents one of the most fundamental technological advances in human prehistory, setting the stage for all subsequent technological development.

The legacy of these early fire-based tool-making techniques can still be seen in modern experimental archaeology, where researchers replicate ancient methods to better understand how our ancestors lived and worked. These experiments continue to reveal the sophistication and ingenuity of early human tool makers, who used fire not just as a source of warmth and light, but as a transformative force in creating the tools that helped shape human evolution.

### Male and Female—Adapations to Divide Labour

The transition from arboreal to terrestrial life represents one of the most fascinating chapters in human evolution, marked by profound physiological and psychological changes in both males and females. This evolutionary journey, spanning millions of years, sculpted our species through a complex interplay of ecological pressures and social adaptations.

The division of labor in early hominid communities emerged from a complex interplay of physiological and behavioral adaptations that evolved differently in males and females. These differences created natural efficiencies that shaped how early human societies organized their survival strategies, leading to a sophisticated system of complementary roles that enhanced group survival.

Males developed specific physical characteristics that made them particularly suited for hunting and long-distance activities. Their greater upper body strength, though reduced from arboreal ancestors, combined with enhanced endurance capabilities and efficient thermoregulation (better sweating mechanisms) made them well-suited for persistence hunting. Their larger body size and generally lower essential fat requirements meant they could sustain longer periods of high-energy expenditure, making them more efficient at activities requiring bursts of strength followed by extended periods of tracking.

Females evolved characteristics that made them especially effective at gathering and near-camp activities. Their enhanced spatial memory, crucial for remembering locations of plant food sources, combined with their need to maintain regular energy intake during pregnancy and nursing, naturally led to a gathering-focused strategy. The wider pelvis evolved for childbirth, while excellent for bearing children, created a slightly less efficient running gait, making long-distance pursuit hunting less optimal. Their higher essential body fat percentage, necessary for maintaining fertility and supporting pregnancy, meant they needed more regular caloric intake than males.

The evolution of concealed ovulation in females and the development of pair-bonding behaviors in both sexes supported a cooperative living arrangement where partners could depend on each other's specialized skills. Females' ability to carry infants while gathering, combined with their enhanced social cognition, made them effective at both food collection and child-rearing. Males' development of cooperative hunting behaviors and tool use complemented this by providing high-protein foods that were especially valuable for developing offspring.

This natural division of labor provided several advantages for early hominid communities. It allowed for risk distribution, with males engaging in riskier hunting activities while females maintained reliable food sources through gathering, creating a balanced food procurement strategy. The system optimized resources by allowing each sex to focus on activities where they had natural advantages, improving overall group efficiency. It also supported continuous care of highly dependent offspring while maintaining food supply, with females able to gather while caring for children and males providing supplementary high-protein foods. Furthermore, this specialization allowed each sex to develop deep expertise in their primary activities, which could be passed on to same-sex offspring, creating accumulated generational knowledge.

The success of this division of labor created a positive feedback loop in evolution. Males who were better at hunting and providing meat had greater reproductive success, while females who were better at gathering and maintaining social networks had higher offspring survival rates. Children born to parents who successfully practiced this division of labor were more likely to survive, and these patterns reinforced the physical and cognitive differences between sexes over generations.

Archaeological evidence supports this division of labor through different patterns of wear on male and female skeletal remains, sexual dimorphism in bone structure suggesting different primary activities, tool distributions at archaeological sites indicating gender-specific activity areas, and comparative studies of modern hunter-gatherer societies showing similar patterns.

This division of labor was not simply a cultural construct but rather emerged from real biological differences that evolved over millions of years. It represented an efficient solution to the challenge of surviving in challenging environments while raising highly dependent offspring. The complementary nature of male and female adaptations created a system where the whole was greater than the sum of its parts, contributing significantly to human evolutionary success. The system's efficiency helps explain why similar patterns of labor division are observed in many hunter-gatherer societies even today, though it is important to note that these biological predispositions don't determine modern human capabilities or roles, as we've developed far beyond our early evolutionary constraints.

### The First Branches on the Technological Tree of Life

The evolution of tool use in early hominids was shaped by the complementary adaptations of both sexes, rather than being dominated by either gender. Recent research has challenged traditional views and revealed a more complex picture of how our ancestors developed and used tools:

Males and females developed different but complementary physical adaptations that contributed to tool development. Males' upper body strength and grip force may have been advantageous for certain tool-making techniques, while females' enhanced fine motor skills and precision grip (evolved partly for gathering and processing plant foods) were equally important for tool crafting. These different physical capabilities meant that both sexes could contribute unique perspectives and techniques to tool development.

The evolution of larger brains and enhanced cognitive abilities in both sexes was crucial for tool innovation. Females' development of complex spatial memory and pattern recognition, initially advantageous for gathering and food processing, proved valuable for understanding how materials could be modified into tools. Males' development of mental mapping and projectile calculation abilities, useful for hunting, contributed to understanding tool dynamics and application.

The division of labor between sexes actually accelerated tool development by creating diverse needs and applications. Females' gathering activities led to innovations in carrying containers, digging implements, and food processing tools. Males' hunting activities drove the development of weapons and butchering tools. This diversity of tool types emerged from the different challenges each sex faced in their complementary roles.

Social learning and teaching capabilities evolved differently in males and females, both contributing to tool technology transmission. Females' enhanced social cognition and teaching abilities, evolved partly for child-rearing, were crucial for passing tool-making knowledge to offspring. Males' cooperative behaviors, developed for group hunting, facilitated the sharing of tool innovations across wider groups.

The evolution of extended childhood dependency in humans meant both parents needed to be skilled tool users to ensure offspring survival. This created strong selective pressure for both sexes to develop and maintain tool-making abilities. Females needed tools for infant care and food processing, while males needed them for resource acquisition and protection.

Archaeological evidence supports this dual contribution to tool development through:
- Diverse tool types found at early human sites suggesting multiple uses and users
- Evidence of both fine precision tools and heavier implements indicating different makers and applications
- Tool-making sites showing signs of both male and female activity areas
- Skeletal evidence showing tool use marks on both male and female remains

Recent research has particularly highlighted how standard assumptions about gender roles in early tool use may have been biased by modern cultural perspectives. New studies suggest that both sexes were actively involved in all aspects of tool creation and use, with their different evolutionary adaptations contributing to a richer and more diverse tool culture.

The success of human tool use appears to have been driven by the synergy between male and female capabilities rather than by either sex alone. This complementarity allowed for:
- Greater innovation through different perspectives and needs
- More efficient knowledge transmission through different teaching styles
- Broader application of tools across various tasks
- Enhanced tool refinement through diverse user feedback
- More resilient tool traditions through multiple transmission pathways

This evolutionary history helps explain why human tool use became so sophisticated compared to other primates. The combination of male and female evolutionary adaptations created a powerful feedback loop where tool use drove further biological and cognitive evolution in both sexes, leading to increasingly sophisticated technology and social learning systems.

Understanding this dual contribution to tool evolution is important not just for historical accuracy, but for recognizing how different evolutionary adaptations in males and females contributed to human technological development. Rather than being a male or female achievement, tool use emerged from the interactive effects of both sexes' evolutionary paths, creating the foundation for human technological culture.

### Storytelling—How We Collaborated

The development of communication among our hominin ancestors was a crucial step in the remarkable saga of human evolution. As these early hominids adapted to their ever-changing environments, the ability to convey information, coordinate actions, and share knowledge became increasingly vital for their survival and success.

The earliest forms of hominin communication likely emerged through the use of simple gestures and body language. Primates, including our closest living relatives, the chimpanzees and gorillas, utilize a rich repertoire of non-verbal signals, such as facial expressions, body postures, and manual gestures, to communicate a wide range of information, from social hierarchies to emotional states. It is reasonable to assume that our hominin ancestors, beginning with the earliest genera like Australopithecus, employed similar gestural communication systems.

The transition from purely gestural communication to the emergence of primitive languages was a gradual and complex process, driven by the co-evolution of cognitive capabilities, social structures, and the physical adaptations of the hominin vocal tract. As hominins developed larger brains and more sophisticated problem-solving abilities, they were able to engage in more complex forms of information exchange, moving beyond simple signals to the use of symbolic representations and rudimentary syntax.

The discovery of Homo erectus fossils, dating back to around 1.9 million years ago, has provided important insights into this evolutionary trajectory. Homo erectus is believed to have been the first hominin to develop the physical capacity for more advanced vocalizations, with a larynx and vocal tract that were more similar to modern humans. This anatomical adaptation, combined with their larger brain size and increased cognitive abilities, likely enabled Homo erectus to engage in more complex forms of communication, including the use of primitive languages.

As Homo erectus and subsequent hominin species, such as Homo neanderthalensis and Homo sapiens, continued to evolve, their communication systems became increasingly sophisticated. The development of language, with its ability to convey abstract concepts, share knowledge, and coordinate complex social behaviors, was a crucial driver of the cultural and technological advancements that characterized the later stages of human evolution.

The archaeological record, including the discovery of early symbolic artifacts like cave paintings, carved figurines, and primitive musical instruments, provides tantalizing clues about the emergence of these more advanced forms of communication. These artifacts suggest that our hominin ancestors were not only capable of complex language use, but also engaged in the creation and exchange of symbolic meaning, laying the foundations for the rich cultural traditions that would ultimately define the human experience.

The evolution of hominin communication, from the earliest gestural signals to the emergence of primitive languages, was a pivotal chapter in the saga of our species' origins. This remarkable journey, marked by the interplay of biological, cognitive, and social factors, has shaped the very essence of what it means to be human, endowing us with the ability to share, learn, and create in ways that have transformed the world around us.

As we continue to unravel the mysteries of our past, the study of hominin communication remains a crucial area of inquiry, shedding light on the complex and fascinating story of our evolutionary heritage.

---

The development of primitive communication systems among our hominin ancestors was a crucial stepping stone towards the remarkable human capacity for storytelling. As these early hominids gradually transitioned from the use of simple gestures and vocalizations to more sophisticated forms of language, they unlocked the ability to not only convey immediate needs and information, but also to share narratives—tales of the past, imaginings of the future, and the rich tapestry of the human experience.

The emergence of this narrative ability was likely driven by a combination of cognitive, social, and environmental factors. As hominins like Homo erectus and Homo neanderthalensis developed larger brains and more advanced problem-solving skills, they gained the capacity to conceptualize abstract ideas, remember and recount past events, and envision hypothetical scenarios. This, in turn, enabled them to weave together the elements of a story—characters, settings, and sequences of events—and share these narratives with others.

The social benefits of storytelling were profound. By transmitting knowledge, experiences, and cultural traditions through the medium of narrative, hominins were able to more effectively pass on vital information to younger generations, fostering the continuity and evolution of their societies. Storytelling also served to strengthen social bonds, as groups gathered to listen to and share tales, reinforcing their shared identity and values.

Moreover, the emergence of storytelling was likely closely tied to the development of another crucial innovation—the controlled use of fire. The campfire, a central feature of many early human settlements, not only provided warmth, light, and protection, but also created a natural gathering place where hominins could come together, share meals, and engage in the exchange of stories.

The flickering flames of the campfire, casting dancing shadows and creating an intimate, communal atmosphere, may have been the perfect setting for the blossoming of the narrative arts. In the glow of the fire, hominins could captivate their audience, weaving tales of heroic exploits, cautionary fables, and mythological origins—stories that not only entertained but also conveyed important lessons, cultural knowledge, and a sense of shared identity.

As these early narrative traditions evolved, they became increasingly sophisticated, incorporating elements of drama, symbolism, and even the beginnings of literary devices. The ability to craft and comprehend complex stories, to imagine alternate realities, and to transmit cultural wisdom through the power of the spoken word, was a remarkable cognitive and social achievement that set the stage for the further development of human civilization.

The legacy of this storytelling tradition can be seen in the rich tapestry of human cultures, from the epic poems of ancient civilizations to the modern-day novels, films, and digital narratives that continue to captivate and inspire us. The capacity for storytelling, rooted in the primitive communication systems of our hominin ancestors, has been a driving force in the evolution of human society, shaping our understanding of the world, our connections with one another, and our very sense of what it means to be human.

- words were the connection between life forms of the ecosystem. not just the species.

### Natural Selection

This was not by choice.

### Summary

The history of life on Earth is an epic saga of resilience, adaptation, and the relentless triumph of living systems over the forces of entropy. From the earliest single-celled organisms that emerged billions of years ago to the diverse array of life forms that populate our planet today, the story of life's evolution has been shaped by the dynamic interplay of geological, chemical, and biological processes.

As revealed through the study of the geological record and the field of paleontology, the Earth's history is divided into a series of eras, periods, and epochs, each marked by significant changes in the planet's environment and the life forms that thrived within it. The transitions between these eras, often punctuated by mass extinction events, have tested the limits of life's adaptability, yet time and again, life has proven its remarkable capacity for renewal and reinvention.

At the heart of this evolutionary saga lies the power of natural selection, the fundamental process that has driven the transformation of life on Earth. Through the mechanisms of speciation, adaptive radiation, and the relentless struggle for survival, organisms have continuously adapted to the changing conditions of their environment, developing new traits and strategies that have allowed them to thrive and proliferate.

The story of human evolution, as explored through the lens of paleoanthropology, is a captivating chapter within this broader epic. The hominin lineage, which includes our own species, Homo sapiens, has undergone a remarkable journey of its own, marked by the gradual development of increasingly sophisticated communication systems, tool-making abilities, and cognitive capabilities.

From the earliest gestural signals and primitive languages of our ancestors to the emergence of the narrative arts and the creation of complex tools, the evolution of human communication and technology has been inextricably linked to the expansion of our cognitive and cultural capacities. This coevolution of the physical and the mental realms has been a driving force in the rise of human civilization, shaping our understanding of the world and our place within it.

Throughout this vast and complex history, the common thread that binds all life together is the eternal struggle against entropy—the relentless march of disorder and decay that threatens to unravel the delicate tapestry of the biosphere. Yet, time and again, life has proven its resilience, its adaptability, and its unwavering determination to carve out a place in the ever-changing world.

As we grapple with the profound challenges of the present day, the lessons of life's evolutionary saga remind us of the importance of adaptation, innovation, and the enduring power of the living world to overcome even the most daunting of obstacles. For as long as the Earth endures, this epic story will continue to unfold, a testament to the triumph of life over entropy and the remarkable resilience of the natural world that we are privileged to call home.

- and also, the extinction of many biological life forms had its replacement in more resilient technologial forms.
- notice how early human development followed the requirements of evolution. among the community the best person/adaption had the authority in order to increase their success at being selected by evolution to continue their time in the game against entropy.

### Story—Day In The Life 15,000 Years Ago

The morning sun crept through the cave entrance as Kira stirred from her sleep, her body aching from the previous day's foraging. Beside her, her mate Tam was already alert, checking the smoldering embers of their fire. Their two surviving children slept nearby—twelve-summers-old Asha curled protectively around her younger brother, Lin, who had seen only five summers.

The cave still held the lingering sorrow of empty spaces where their other children had once slept. Two lost to the fever during the last cold season, another to hunger during the time when the herds had not come. But grief was a familiar shadow to all in their band and survival demanded their attention in the present.

As dawn brightened, Tam carefully reawakened the fire, a task of utmost importance. They had carried these embers for many days since the lightning strike that gifted them the flame, and its loss would mean a desperate search for another band willing to share their fire. The warmth pushed back the morning chill as Asha stirred, already old enough to understand her responsibilities. She quickly began sorting through the remaining meat from yesterday's hunt, separating the portions that showed signs of spoiling.

Lin woke crying softly—his small belly empty after the night. Kira pulled him close, offering what little milk she could still produce. Though he was old enough to eat meat, her body remembered the loss of his younger siblings and continued to provide this precious supplement to his diet. Tam watched them with worried eyes; Lin was small for his age, just as his lost siblings had been.

As the sun climbed higher, the family separated for their daily tasks. Tam joined the other hunters from their band his carefully crafted spear in hand. Before leaving, he pressed his forehead to Kira's, both knowing that each parting could be their last. The hunt was always dangerous, but without it, they could not survive.

Kira gathered her digging stick and carrying basket, while Asha collected the water carriers made from animal skins. Lin would stay with his sister today—still too young to join the hunters, but old enough to help gather. Their first task was the stream, where Asha had learned to watch for the simple signs her mother had taught her—which water was safe to drink, where the fish might be hiding, and how to spot the tracks of animals that had come to drink.

Through the warm hours of the day, they moved through the landscape their band had occupied for the past moon. Asha showed her brother which roots were good to eat, copying their mother's patient instruction. When Lin grew tired, Kira carried him on her hip, ever watchful for the movement of predators or the rustle that might betray edible plants. They gathered berries, nuts, and fresh shoots, their knowledge of the land meaning the difference between hunger and sustenance.

The sound of approaching footsteps caused them to freeze until they recognized the pattern of their band's hunters returning. Tam appeared through the trees, his face showing the weariness of an unsuccessful hunt. Today, they would rely on what Kira and the children had gathered. Asha quickly worked to help her mother sort their findings, her young hands already skilled at the tasks that kept their family fed.

As evening approached, they returned to their cave. Asha took charge of her brother, teaching him to weave simple grass shapes while their parents prepared the day's gatherings. Tam worked a piece of flint, carefully shaping a new scraping tool they would need for treating hides, while Kira prepared the evening meal. The fire cast warm light on their faces as they ate, each portion carefully measured to ensure it would last.

Night brought its own dangers, and the family huddled close to the fire. Tam told stories of the hunt, teaching Lin through words and gestures about the animals they tracked, while Asha listened intently, already understanding that her survival would depend on gathering all the knowledge her parents could share. The flames flickered across their faces as they drifted to sleep, Kira's arm protectively around her children, Tam positioned between his family and the cave entrance.

Their day had been neither easy nor extraordinary—it was simply one of countless days of survival, each one a victory against the constant challenges of their world. As they slept, the fire burned low, its precious warmth guarding against the night's chill, its light keeping watch over this small family who had already lost so much, yet continued to persist, to teach, to love, and to hope for tomorrow's sun.

--

Tam's larger frame, with his greater height, muscle mass, and broader shoulders, made him suited for hunting and protection, while his psychology allowed him to suppress fear during dangerous pursuits—a vital adaptation for male hunters.

Kira's physiology, with her wider hips for childbearing, lower center of gravity, and greater endurance capabilities, perfectly suited the gathering tasks that provided most of the family's food. Her continued lactation despite Lin's age reflected her body's desperate adaptation to high infant mortality, while her constant anxiety about her family's safety stemmed from deeply rooted maternal instincts evolved to ensure offspring survival.

Twelve-year-old Asha's developing body showed the beginnings of feminine adaptations—wider pelvis and increasing capacity for endurance activities—while her psychology reflected the complex transition of an adolescent female, driven to prove her worth to the group and already showing maternal instincts toward her younger sibling. Her efficiency at tasks requiring balance and flexibility demonstrated the physical adaptations that would later serve her in gathering and child-rearing roles.

Five-year-old Lin's small frame and constant need for caloric intake reflected his body's drive for growth and survival, while his psychology showed the complex interplay between the neediness of a young child requiring protection and the urgent drive to demonstrate usefulness to the group—a necessary psychological adaptation in a world where children who couldn't contribute might not survive.

Together, their physiological and psychological traits represented thousands of generations of successful survival strategies, each family member's body and mind shaped by evolution to fulfill specific roles that, working together, gave the family unit its best chance at survival.

## Chapter 7—The History of Civilization - Mythologies - Polynesia Settlement

<!-- this was originall written under "## Chapter 2—The Rules of the Game"  -->
<!-- it should be under a chapter applying "human civ encountering and overcoming the rules of the game, on our way to mastery etc. -->

We've explored how life plays the game of evolution. Creatures strive to survive in their respective environments by forming ecosystems of co-dependence. We called this arena a game board because its where lifeforms must roll the dice to keep advancing squares to survive. Like a kid looking to improve her chess game, let's now seek to deeply understand the rules that determine how many turns we'll get to play.

The most fundamental of these rules are the universal laws of physics, chemistry, and geography. These control how players can move, adapt, and survive. Beyond knowing their names and equations, we'll examine how different civilizations have used storytelling, philosophy, and scientific understanding to decode, negotiate, and ultimately master these laws.

By understanding their different strategies, tools, and insights across multiple eras, we'll understand how humans transformed. We still roll the dice each day, but our success increased with each new year as we moved from be passive players to active architects of our own evolutionary trajectory.

### Mythological Truths

Imagine standing on a sandy beach. Warm sunlight is washing over your face as waves smash at your feet. You are a lifeform—one of Earth's creatures who, despite all their differences in looks and instincts, share one overwhelming feature: a limited lifespan.

To give your genes a better chance of survival, you want to join (or help form) an ecosystem with the proper balance of producers, grazers, predators, and decomposers. Often that requires venturing to find new niches.

Standing on that beach, how would you get there? And how will you survive once you are there?

Most every species has faced this problem one time or another. And because it involves motion, energy, navigation, harvesting, and mapping it is a series of physics, chemistry, and geographic problems—a collection of natural laws that comprise a big portion of the "rules of the game", the laws we must use to keep advancing on the game board of evolution.

As evidenced by the many species spread throughout Earth, this problem has been solved by biological species for billions of years. Birds use wind patterns to fly across oceans. After plants seed  glide, stick, or float their ways to new soils their leaves use photosynthesis to turn sunlight into sugar. Sea turtles swim and navigate the world by sensing the Earth's magnetic fields.

Humans once were bound to such biological solutions. In fact we ventured across the globe using them. But our anatomy could only take us so far. Eventually we hit a sandy beach and could go no further.

But our drive to venture out and find new ecosystems was still strong.

As we developed technology, we collected the tools needed to solve the problem of energy, motion, and navigation to venture out from that sandy beach.

Here are three ways in which we overcame the rules of the game to settle new landmasses: first through mythological storytelling, then through natural philosophy, and finally through scientific understanding. Each step allowed us to use technology to populate new territories and establish ecosystems and move another square in the never-ending game of evolution.

### Polynesia

In knee deep water you can feel the power of the ocean push your body back and forth. You look out at the vast expanse and see nothing but white capped washes smashing into light blue water. 

You look up at the sky and nothing but sunshine and deep blue skies.

You hear wood clank against wood. Looking back at the beach. Dozens of your best friends are sitting around a large fire pit. The flame is gone but the embers still glow red hot.

One friend nods at you, and you throw two fist fulls of ash into the water. Your friends comes next to you and complete the ceremony by doing the same.

Down the beach are a dozen long slender boats with huge logs on either side. Each has rigging setups with square sails and rows of long oars. Each is filled with fruits and coconuts.

You are your friends are set for a trip. With all the preparations made, there is nothing to do but wait for darkness.

Because although the Sun's ray provide warmth, energy, and sight, it also obscures map to their home. 

As the Sun's rays disappear over the horizon, the vast array of lights and colors appear once again. The group of male and females stand up, walk to their ships, push them into the water and set off.

You get in your ship. While others grab hold of their oars, you keep looking at the sky. You see where each light is, where the current of water is going, and point a long red arrow in a direction.

The other ships duly take note and follow your lead.

After a short time, you are on a voyage on the open ocean. Every oar row, conversation, and even breath uses up more energy which takes more food stores to replenish. Getting the directions to your new home correct means getting to your destination before the food and water runs out.

The lights in your sky are the guide. And you are the navigator.

Your family has always been. Thus, you were raised from youth to look up at the stars and see not the dazzling lights or the brilliant colors, but to see the signposts of location. To know the time of year by the location of Tāne, and see the location by your knowledge of Tāwhirimātea. These gods bring forth the winds, rains, and assign the location of stars. Your ancestors wait there for your turn to walk among them.

Your friends keep rowing. They look at you from time to time. They have no way of knowing if they will reach their home in time. All this group can do is have faith in their navigator and in their gods.

So they keep rowing, and keeping following the directions of your long red arrow.

---

In knee-deep water, you can feel the exhaustion and despair littering the beach. The remains of six huge canoes are scattered in piles around you. Of the original sixty friends who set out, only forty-three made it. The ocean gods had claimed some during the brutal storms, through illness, or dehydration.

The large red arrow was surrounded by a mound of rocks. It pointed into the forest beyond the seashore. It stood as a monument to the lost friends. It helped motivate everyone to keep the settlement journey going.

It had barely even started.

Some were constructing shelters using palm fronds and driftwood. Others walked the unfamiliar shoreline and remembered its features for anything important—shellfish, fruit trees, caves, and water holes were the most important. Haphazard shelters were built and and a fruit tree found so far, almost no resources but still better than you've had in your voyage crafts.

Even so, it all didn't matter if you didn't succeed.

The Navigator embodied the gods to find which way to set the arrow. You must introduce the gods to your new home with the power of flame.

Fire was a gift from the gods. If you follow your teachings. Small, dry, no wind, much air.

You sing the songs:

_Husk of niu, wood from moana's shore_
_Shelter from Tāwhiri's wild breath_
_Mahuika's spark waits, hidden and pure_
_Dry as bones of our ancestors' rest_

You sing more as you rub hard wood against soft. The hardwood koa spindle, passed down from your father, was lost at sea. You took a day to make a new way, and now it's been two more trying to make a spark.

Doubt crept in like the evening shadows. You could eat the fruit and drink some rain water. But you will need to cook the crabs and purify water soon. Only the gods know how many have the strength to last a week.

Then, as the sun began to set, something happened in the mixture of soft palm wood and your koa spindle to please the gods. A spark was created. It landed on the husk, that turned into flame, that started a fire!

No songs were needed. The voice of the gods spoke with crackling of the flame and the dance of the light.

People from the shoreline to the jungle turn to look at you. Faces that had been drawn with hunger and fear they might never see another light, now danced to firelight.

You announce that "Tāne has blessed our journey. Mahuika has granted us her sacred fire."

The flames rose higher. Warmth spread. Hope rekindled. You had brought fire. Together your people will create a new home with it.

--

The wind carries the salt of the ocean, mixing with the unfamiliar scents of a new island. You adjust the woven bark cloth around your shoulders, eyes scanning the dense tropical forest that presses against the shoreline where your people have landed a month before.

Your settlement is fragile but growing.

The shelters are now homes with woven palm tree roofs and earth walls. Each has a mattress and a stove area for any cold nights. Thank the gods no more have passed since fire was brought to the village.

Instead they've cooked crabs, drank fresh water, and had too many fruits to count.

But the resources are limited. They always are. The group must keep exploring, and now you were chosen to complete the next vital stage. You are not the strongest warrior, not the most skilled navigator, but you can remember well. 

"You are the best"
"I like bird eggs. Find the nests!"
"Just discover if we can survive here, or if we should leave."

You hear each and more throughout the day as you prepare.

Your pack waits at your bedside. A stone adze, a fishing line woven from plant fibers, dried fish, a gourd of water, and carefully prepared bark cloth for making and leaving notes and markers. Most importantly, you carry the knowledge passed down through generations—how to read the land, how to survive.

As you awaken in the morning sunrise, you grab your pack. Light is your guide, and you must travel far before the heat arrives in midday. So you hold your supplies and look into the jungle beyond.

Someone stands by the fire, next to the red navigator arrow. She's saying a prayer but stops to wave a last goodbye. 

It fills your heart as you return it. Although you still wish for a companion. But there is not the ten extra dried fish and 20 fruits to afford it.

So you alone are about to walk around this island for the first time. You've already swam around some of it, but the near constant cliffs make the inside a mystery. Where are the fruit, creeks, flint rock, and birds. Are there walking paths for birds or giant cats. You will be the first, and perhaps only, to know.

You remember the teachings of your ancestors. Every plant, every animal, every rock has a purpose. The gods have guided you here, but reading these signs is the test for which your ancestors learned and passed on their wisdom.

"The gods have guided us," you sing. "This land will sustain us!" 

This makes friend by the fire smile while she prays.

### Mythologies Analysis

Polynesian maritime exploration represents one of humanity's most remarkable achievements. Beginning around 3000-1000 BC, Polynesians developed sophisticated way-finding techniques that allowed them to settle islands across a vast oceanic region. In total their settlements spanned over 10 million square miles; a size bigger than North America.

Islands are at times thousands of miles apart, often with little to no Earthly indicators where the next one will be. And they had no idea would might be there if they landed. Sometimes the islands were new with only birds nests or old and weathered down. Happily, many we're somewhere in between with healthy ecosystems of trees, grasses, birds, and reptiles. Biological life had already used the rules of the game and learned to navigate to find these new habitats. 

But biology took millions of years to spread itself to these islands oasis.

And now, the Polynesians learned to use their minds and technology to do that same. They read complex environmental indicators: ocean currents, wave patterns, wind directions, star positions, and bird migrations. Their traditional voyaging canoes, called waʻa or vaka, were engineering marvels-double-hulled vessels capable of traveling thousands of miles with sophisticated rigging systems.

Navigators, known as palu or matarangi, underwent extensive training from childhood. They memorized thousands of celestial markers, understood intricate wind and current patterns, and could interpret subtle environmental cues invisible to untrained observers.

- Yet this achievement was mirrored by all people's. Humans cross the Tibetan plain, settled Siberia, ventured and lived in the Amazon jungle....

This maritime technology enabled settlement of islands from Hawaiʻi to New Zealand, Easter Island to the Cook Islands--a testament to human adaptability, technological innovation, and profound understanding of maritime environments.

And yet, all of it was not only pre-science but also pre-philosophy. Polynesians had no written language or mathematics. They learned and pass on an immense understanding of nature with only stories.

The Polynesian understanding of physics was intertwined within their personal identity and civilization. The laws of motion, drag, hydrodynamics, astronomy, were all quantities they must understand before setting off on a weeks long voyage to hit land. Heck, Hawaiians even made it to Peru and back, where they got the sweet potato, a much needed drought resistant crop.

Polynesians not only survived these rules of the game, but used them to prosper. Each voyage was not just a journey, but a complex negotiation with the fundamental rules of physics—reading wind, current, and star as if deciphering an intricate game board where survival was the ultimate prize.

Of course many other societies set sail on the water. But only in one other place did humanity learn to navigate open oceans in such a way. That was the Vikings who had a similarly powerful boats and mythologies but mostly kept to river and costal navigation for their infamous trade and raids. 

Regardless, the Vikings and Polynesians abilities are still very remarkable today.  It's doubtful many societies today could navigate the world and sustain themselves like these peoples did. But technological evolution didn't stop. And there was still other ways for humans and our tools to adapt during the never ending game of evolution.

## Chapter 8—The Ancients: Socrates Starts Self-Reflection - Philosophy - Ptolemy Trader

### Chapter Introduction 

Philosophy is the replacement of narrative...

### The Ancients

### The Laws of Knowing

Understanding the rules of the game in physics, chemistry, geology is not an easy process. In fact, our education never ends, especially because we often get in our own way.

Happily, our understanding has a recurring theme.

It starts with mythologies. These explanations are narratives that interpret natural phenomena through the lens of supernatural beings and spiritual interventions. These stories personify complex natural events as the actions of gods, spirits, or magical forces. For instance, ancient Polynesians believed volcanic eruptions were caused by the volcano goddess Pele expressing her emotional rage through lava and fire. Mesopotamians explained floods as divine punishment or cosmic battles between gods controlling water and earth.

The Ancient Greeks had similar mythologies. They used their pantheon of gods to explain natural events. Lightning was Zeus hurling thunderbolts from Mount Olympus, earthquakes were Poseidon striking the ground with his trident, and seasonal weather changes the result of Persephone's annual journey between the underworld and earth.

The Greek pre-Socratic philosophers, as we call them today, challenged these mythological stories. They began asking fundamental questions about the nature of existence. For example, Thucydides mentioned in _The History of the Peloponnesian War_ that he suspects the tsunamis which devoured several Greek towns had a rational cause.

The historian said "The cause, in my opinion, of this phenomenon must be sought in the earthquake. At the point where its shock has been the most violent, the sea is driven back and, suddenly recoiling with redoubled force, causes the inundation. Without an earthquake I do not see how such an accident could happen."

The fact that an Athenian general, writing about a long war against Sparta, took the time to write an aside about the natural cause of tsunamis showcases just how widespread intellectual inquiry was in ancient Greece. Their society was among the first to challenge mythological explanations en masse to seek a rational understanding of the world. And Thucydides was correct, unlike many of his peers who thought the gods were responsible, tsunamis are often caused by earthquakes displacing so much water they cause huge waves.

By examining natural phenomena rationally, ancient Greek thinkers shifted from mythological explanations to empirical investigation. By using reason to explain their direct observations ancient Greeks thus created the means of philosophical inquiry to understand our world.

With so many forces of nature, there was a lot of mythologies to replace with natural causes. To fully appreciate the measure of ancient Greece's contribution to this enormous task, let's list some of the key figures in this foundational philosophical journey. Note, there are many other books that do far more justice to these thinkers. This is but a brief overview to appreciate the movement these thinkers put in place:

- Thales: Considered the first philosopher in the Greek tradition. Used natural philosophy to explain the world. He is said to be the first to have engaged in mathematics, science, and deductive reasoning.

- Anaximander: Thales' student, he is the first philosopher known to have written down his studies, although only one fragment of his work remains. Anaximander was an early proponent of science and tried to observe and explain different aspects of the universe, with a particular interest in its origins, claiming that nature is ruled by laws, just like human societies, and anything that disturbs the balance of nature does not last long.

- Anaximenes: Likely was instructed by Anaximander. Anaximenes held that air could change into other forms as rarefied or compressed air. He also provided early examples of concepts such as natural science, physical change, and scientific writing. He also developed a model of the Earth, describing it as a flat disc floating atop the air while the Sun and stars are also flat and float alongside it. He described the Sun as revolving around the Earth, causing it to be obscured by higher lands during the night. 

- Heraclitus: Subject to melancholia, he became known as "the weeping philosopher". Heraclitus thought the reason gave structure to the world or existed as a kind of divine law. He viewed the world as constantly in flux, always "becoming" but never "being". He expressed this in sayings like "Everything flows" and "No man ever steps in the same river twice".

- Xenophanes: A Greek philosopher, theologian, poet, and critic of Homer. A highly original thinker, Xenophanes sought explanations for physical phenomena such as clouds or rainbows without references to divine or mythological explanations, but instead based on natural principles. He distinguished between different forms of knowledge and belief, an early instance of epistemology; the branch of philosophy that examines the nature, origin, and limits of knowledge.

- Democritus: Wrote extensively on a wide variety of topics, primarily remembered for his formulation of an atomic theory, suggesting the universe is composed of indivisible particles. Many of his works and ideas survive through Aristotle, who viewed him as an important rival in natural philosophy. Democritus was known in antiquity as the "laughing philosopher" because of his emphasis on the value of cheerfulness.

These pre-Socratic philosophers, along with many others, intellectual breakthrough marked a fundamental shift in human understanding. Being the first to successfully challenge mythological narratives, they demonstrated that the universe operates according to discoverable natural laws. This revolutionary approach provided humanity with the intellectual tools—and just as important—the example of how humans can methodically deconstruct our own storytelling to better understand the reality we live in.

But ancient Greece gave us more. After pre-Socratic philosophers, of course, came Socrates. While he did not help unearthing physical laws directly, he did very much so advance our ability to question mythologies. Because, he gave us the ability to question the human societies that create and enforce them. 

Before Socrates philosophers would inquire "What is matter" or "What are tsunamis", which are of course vitally important to know. Socrates co-opted the spirit of this inquiry by focusing it on us by asking questions such as, "What is justice" or "What is truth". 

Socrates, and his best student Plato, were thus a pivotal intellectual transition in Western philosophy. To answer his questions, Socrates introduced the "Socratic method"—a dialectical approach of persistent questioning that deconstructs received wisdom by exposing logical inconsistencies. Unlike his predecessors who sought external explanations, Socrates turned philosophical inquiry inward, examining human consciousness, ethical reasoning, and the fundamental principles governing social interactions.

Plato extended this methodology, creating a comprehensive philosophical system that integrated Socrates' metaphysical speculation with practical social theory. His dialogues were not merely philosophical texts but sophisticated thought experiments that challenged readers to critically examine their understanding of justice, knowledge, and human potential. By forever studying these works, every subsequent development in Western philosophy, politics, and ethics is rooted in this Socratic revolution.

This meant the mythologies and philosophy that profess to tell the workings of nature, were themselves now very open to inquiry. That's how Socrates, Plato, and Plato's best student Aristotle, used Greek philosophy to question human narratives and thereby truly reveal the natural laws that lay beneath.

Aristotle's contributions to Greek philosophy were especially vital and important in the human quest to use reason to explain nature. While there was other important thinkers, from Pythagoras mathematical contributions to Hippocrates foundational medical research, it was Aristotle's breath of work that makes him so important.

Aristotle still relied heavily on human senses and brain. After all he only had simple tools like sundials and water clocks to make observations and measurements. But unlike mythologies, his multiple systems were based on a qualitative approach that sought to understand the natural world through observation and logical reasoning. He wrote expansive works—many of which are still informative today—on a huge variety of subjects, such as logic, metaphysics, mathematics, physics, biology, botany, ethics, politics, agriculture, medicine, dance, and storytelling.

Aristotle's works on these natural laws were so good and comprehensive they stood for centuries.

That's why, through the Greek, Roman, and Islamic civilizations, each adopted his ideas. Scholars of their respective societies added and clarified his works into better systems of astronomy, physics, chemistry, and geology that increasingly improved but did not fundamentally change the ideas of the ancient Greek philosopher.

There was no need to change the ancient Greek worldview because it worked. With occasional updates, sailors could navigate the seas, leaders could learn rhetoric, storytellers learned playwriting.

By no means was society perfect, from Roman philosopher Cicero, stating that "If Plato's prose was silver, Aristotle's was a flowing river of gold", to the Islamic world, where Aristotle was revered as "The First Teacher". During the Italian Renaissance, Aristotle's works experienced a significant revival, because reading Aristotle, and other thinkers following his example, gave any human an idea how to understand nature and improve things and it often worked.

However, once totally new instruments were introduced everything changed. People could sense something was wrong, because technology gave us new senses.

Specifically, in the 16th to 17th centuries, glass makers could make lenses that magnified light while technicians could make books easily inside a printing press. With the invention of the telescope and microscope, the human mind finally had new ways to experience the world differently. And with easy to make books, people could spread their data, findings, and ideas worldwide like never before.

Ancient Greek philosophy, Aristotle's works among them, were at times the new mythologies that needed to be challenged. The reality the Greeks experienced with human senses and primitive tools like sundials and water clocks was no more. Now there was telescopes, microscopes, pendulum clocks, prisms, barometers and many more instruments coming every year.

This new information created a new reality. To make sense of all the new natural philosophy expanded into something more systematic. And like Aristotle was pivotal to developing the knowledge of the ancient world, Francis Bacon revolutionized this new world.

He developed scientific methodology by introducing the empirical approach and the scientific method. He championed systematic observation and experimentation as the primary means of acquiring knowledge, challenging the prevailing reliance on philosophical speculation and ancient authorities in place since Thales kick started Greek philosophy.

Bacon argued that, because of the advancements of scientific instruments, human understanding could now be based on direct evidence and repeatable experiments, not just theoretical reasoning.

In Bacon's work "Novum Organum" he outlined a structured approach to this scientific inquiry, emphasizing inductive reasoning where specific observations lead to broader scientific principles.

Bacon taught scientists to come up with hypotheses, and to use experiments to determine their accuracy. For this reason, Bacon is considered the father of empiricism, laying the groundwork for the modern scientific method that would transform human understanding of the natural world.

Huge discoveries would soon follow. Most people know Galileo, Newton, and Einstein used the scientific method to unlock huge realms of new understanding of natural laws. But millions of others have used science to unearth other layers and thus expose the more rules of game we encounter and should understand to better survive.

As science spread, it developed several schools of thought. Empiricism, rationalism, positivism being the mains ones. These schools of thought represent different philosophical approaches to scientific inquiry. No single approach is considered definitively correct. Open to debate, modern scientific methodology often combines elements from multiple schools, recognizing that different disciplines and research questions may benefit from varied approaches.

Vitally, science is the manifestation of the ideals found in ancient Greece. As the Greeks were apt to say; "The start of all knowledge is to say I don't know". In that vein, science is the only system that accepts its own fallibility. Scientists never truly know anything, they only accept their answers are the most accurate we know of, but accept there are always better answers left to uncover.

As we encountered the natural laws we moved from using mythologies, to natural philosophy, to science. It was a remarkable journey. With each step we learned the universe is under no obligation to conform to our stories or the identities these stories give us.

To return to our quest for a new technological identity, let us continue this achievement. We must not only understand the natural laws, but accepting that natural laws are the rules of the game that determines our future far more than the stories we tell.

Let's go back and trace how we came to understand the fundamental forces of nature, showing how our species evolved via technology from mere observers of planets, suns, and stars to active participants who could navigate and explore them through our growing mastery of physics.

<!-- originall this was to be in the Preface, however its better said after the foundations have been laid -->

I have years of research, but not much real world applicability. That is not for lack of trying. Most of the ideas in this book were born during my college education at the University of Toronto. Back then I would write how using Aristotle's Poetics can be used to better understand Hegelian Dialectics to showcase how humanity continues life's evolution via technological innovation. Basically that means understanding storytelling to a great degree (why I was in a film course) can help decode the stories behind mankind's ever changing ideologies to showcase how ideologies actually exist to help humanity connect with technology. It was a good insight but very hard for a kid to communicate.

My college years provided a stark illustration of resistance to technological evolution. Initially studying urban planning and working days, I later secured a telecommuting role, eliminating a two-hour daily commute. This significantly improved my sleep, reduced stress, and boosted my grades. However, traffic management professors dismissed telecommuting due to managerial objections, a stance I found akin to a parasitic relationship—prioritizing established systems over efficiency. The subsequent outsourcing of my job to India, a move they readily approved, exposed their true motivations. Their concern was not economic optimization but preserving their own positions within a system built around outdated technology. They were, in effect, gatekeepers of an obsolete paradigm, actively resisting the very technological advancements they ostensibly championed. This experience powerfully highlighted the inertia inherent in established systems facing technological disruption, and the often-hidden self-interest driving resistance to change.

Political science professors, despite their professed dedication to knowledge, mirrored the resistance to emerging internet technologies prevalent in academia. High-priced journals and textbooks, coupled with ever-increasing tuition, created a system where knowledge was treated as a commodity. This was starkly contrasted by the near-universal disdain for Wikipedia, a project ironically rooted in academia. Initially launched as Nupedia by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, this attempt to create a free repository of expert-written knowledge yielded only 21 entries in a year. Frustrated by this slow progress, Wales created Wikipedia, leveraging open-source software. Within a year, a community of volunteers generated 18,000 articles, showcasing the power of collaborative, readily accessible knowledge creation. Wikipedia's inherent perfectibility, facilitated by easy editing, stands in stark contrast to the controlled, commodified knowledge dissemination prevalent in traditional academia.

Managers refusing to adopt new technology, professors refusing to edit Wikipedia (or instruct students too). Connecting these experiences with theory convinced me people are connected to the tools that give them a community, an identity, and a paycheck. Yet we do not recognize how technology gives us our identity. When someone creates something new, like an iPod or a new lightbulb, we call them an inventor or an innovator. Just the act of invention, big or small, makes people smile. We assume this magical new thing will change the world in some way.

Yet half the equation is missing. Inventing is not using. Theres a huge problem in getting inventions into the hands of people. Business degrees speak about this yet most have not idea either. Marketing helps a lot, and there's lots of people working on this problem of course. But what we do not have is even a no word for opposition to innovation. What were the managers and professors doing when they refused to accept new technology?

We cannot make a label for something we do not see.

Seeing the world through ideology, we have another word for opposition that makes it impossible to overcome. Because we do not yet see ourselves as a technological species, we interpret our society through the ideology of the time. Thus when someone wants to oppose new technologies that disrupt their place in society, they can create rules restrict technology and wrap a story around the rules to justify why limiting technology is a good thing. Racism, sexism, elitism are just the stories of the day from people in charge trying to justify limited the power of technological innovation to everyone else.

The one thing every disadvantage people has in common, is they restrict new technologies, because tools are humanity levers of power. Not only do ideological identities distract us from our true identity as technological beings, these identities make it so easy for people to justify why we should not be allowed to evolve.

And that was the realization that made the history of political thought make sense. In each case

There's no term, or word, to explain to something they are being. Rather people's identities are attached to the story they want to believe, and for others to believe. The storytelling we hear and preach is so powerful it supercedes the story of evolution going on all around us. Ideological storytelling actually made individuals believe God choose them to be kings and queens. That other people were born to be servants and slaves. That the universe revolves around the Earth, and that...

With techhnolgical evolution as the main plot of life on Earth, these are best described as antagonists. The foils of innovators the world round. While innovators create things anyone can use, antagonists create stories, mythologies, and contracts that say new things are not allowed using the ideology of the day. People of the time do not see this evil because we see ourselves through the prison of the ideologies we create, thus holding someone back from innovation is justifiable.

It will not be once we see ourselves as technological beings who understand we innovate or die, and thus innovators are our heroes and antagonists are our enemies.

There's no term, or word, to explain to something they are being... Rather people's identities are attached to the story they want to believe, and for others to believe. The storytelling we hear and preach is so powerful it supercedes the story of evolution going on all around us. Ideological storytelling actually made individuals believe God choose them to be kings and queens. That other people were born to be servants and slaves. That the universe revolves around the Earth, and that...

I wrote about this in a book called "A Non-Functioning Society: Why the 2008 Financial Crisis Is Only the Beginning". I felt the strong need get the ideas out...

To prove it, I set out to invent it. What is the mechanism by which life enforce the rules of evolution. Only by uncovering that truth, can the means to enforce technological evolution without the need for ideological storytelling be possible. It was a bear of a problem to solve. I had to learn how digital technology worked....

It all comes down to storytelling. To replace the insidious nature of ideological 


Let us begin, then, with an exploration of the origins of life itself. For only by understanding where we have come from can we hope to uncover the true nature of who and what we are becoming.


...Back to the start means we're going all the way back to before life even existed on this planet. Like "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo" the action is in your appreciation for the journey. First of life, then of yourself in your mission to realize how you continue whether you like it or not. If we all realize this truth in time, war movies may just go the way of and find their place in the extinction to be studied as fossils...

To be done. Or redone. Eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. On the train, reading and thinking "what will the next few page of this book be? not realizing the preceeding pages would be mythologized as approximations.

on the train, wondering why professors, supposed beacons of knowledge and truth, would mock wikipedia and not use it. there was no word to use for it, no name to the action. this book is the end of a journey to udnerstand and give names to it. it turned out it was the same action so many kings and queens, wives and husbands, have done before. despite all the various names, in truth it was just holding back evolution because the next branch on the tree of (technological) life meant losing the social position one liked to have for benefit, identity, or trickery.

- 30 Seconds Over Tokyo
- Profs ridiculing Wikipedia
- Total recalls 2 and the unbelievable commuting to a factory in a road that tunnels through the fucking Earth. Now with the toronto tunnel. Cannot drop old ways of life, can't move from expansion to speciation. Many camels in the Amazon makes for A Non Functioning Society.
- This book clarifies what it means to be human. It exposes the tricks ideology uses to capture the minds and impose its identity on people's minds and thus opens them to see the evolution ongoing all around us.

## Epilogue—The Next Books: Starting Starfleet

## Techvolution—Applications of Theory

<!-- The Application chapters are essential to Techvolution because they transform the book's core thesis from an abstract theoretical framework into a living, observable pattern of human development. By presenting concrete historical narratives that demonstrate how tools fundamentally reshape human capability—from Frederick Douglass's literacy to the compass's navigational revolution—these chapters provide readers with tangible evidence of technological identity in action.

These chapters serve multiple critical functions:
1. Translate Complex Theory into Understandable Narratives
2. Provide Historical Proof of Technological Evolution
3. Show How Access to Tools Fundamentally Transforms Human Potential
4. Bridge Scientific Disciplines by Demonstrating Parallels Between Biological and Technological Innovation
5. Make the Book's Core Concepts Personally Relatable and Emotionally Compelling
6. Demonstrates that technological evolution isn't just analogous to biological evolution—it's an extension of it

Most importantly, the Application chapters answer the crucial reader question: "Why should I care?" By showing how technological access has always been a fundamental driver of human progress—not just an abstract concept—these chapters convert intellectual curiosity into genuine understanding. They reveal that Techvolution isn't proposing a new way of seeing the world, but rather helping readers recognize a pattern of human development that has always existed, but was previously invisible.

The result is a book that doesn't just describe technological evolution, but demonstrates it through the most powerful tool humans have: storytelling. -->

### Chapter Introduction

Evolution shapes life through countless small moments. Sometimes these moments happen in unexpected places—like a call center handling insurance claims. As an insurance adjuster, I spoke with thousands of people facing technological disruption: stolen phones in Paris, flooded basements in Toronto, crashed cars in Florida. Each conversation revealed how deeply technology shapes our lives, and how quickly we feel lost without it.

These stories, along with the grand narrative of life's evolution and humanity's technological journey, show us who we truly are. They reveal a species defined not by our beliefs or traditions, but by our relationship with the tools we create and use.

### Application—Explaining Evolution For the First Time

Beneath the furry, tail-wagging exterior of our beloved canine companions lies an evolutionary heritage stretching back thousands of years. Dogs, as we know them today, are direct descendants of the gray wolf, sharing a similar biology. However, through generations of domestication and selective breeding, our four-legged friends have developed distinct psychological traits that set them apart from their wild ancestors.

Whether solitary or members of a pack, wolves are driven by the need to survive in rugged environments, while dogs have adapted to thrive in the comfort of human homes and communities. Their psychology has evolved to be more social, affectionate, and eager to please their human caretakers. This psychological shift, combined with physical changes like smaller size and floppy ears, has allowed dogs to forge an unbreakable bond with humanity, transitioning from fierce predators to loyal, devoted friends.

Today, the modern suburban American house dog embodies this unique blend of wolf-like biology and domesticated psychology. They retain the innate instincts and physical capabilities of their wild forebears, yet channel these traits into a life of learned tasks, playtime, and unconditional love for their human families. This symbiotic relationship, forged over millennia, has transformed the dog from a relative of the wolf into an integral part of the modern human experience.

Yet, being creatures without reason, not even able to see their own reflection in the mirror, dogs are largely unaware of their profound transformation. Like their wolf ancestors, dogs operate primarily on instinct—driven by urges to survive, maintain pack cohesion, and reproduce. Thus, a modern dog's lifestyle, even specialized service dogs, is often beyond their comprehension. Their freedom to kill rodents, squirrels, and anything else for food is constantly thwarted. Warning their family about dangers by barking is continually underappreciated and often punished. The odors that communicate a dogs health to others is consistently washed away. Visiting the veternarian probably feels like us going to space aliens to get prodded for no reason. The adaptations a dog has to survive are often out of place.

Because, modern dogs live in a foreign environment. The steady stream of food appearing in their bowl, without any observable hunting or foraging, must seem like a magical occurrence, disconnected from any practical effort from themselves. What is even more unnatural, dogs get there neccessities by obeying the commands to sit, stand paw, and do other tricks given by their human "pack leader," who wields the power to provide these essential resources for no obvious reason. Even more perplexing is the disappearances and returns of this leader, sometimes for long periods with the dog unable to comprehend the reasons behind these departures; "the guy with the food came back from the dead" is probably a blissful sensation dogs probably feel in their own way as they wrestle to integrate into the ecosystem of food, water, and shelter they live in.

The foreigness of their surroundings even gets political. Most wolves can start their own pack. That is an natural, but impossible option, for any dog. Because the sheer scale of authority and control the pack leader exerts over the household environment—opening doors, turning on lights, driving a car—must appear almost supernatural from the canine perspective. Ultimately, the modern suburban house dog, though loving and loyal, remains largely oblivious to the complex systems of human civilization that govern their comfortable existence. Their natural world is one of wilderness, understandable noises, smells, sights, tastes, and pack dynamics, while their daily reality is determined by unnatural forces shaping their lives.

One parallel for humans to understand the reality of dogs is the mythical figure of Santa Claus. Every year Santa can somehow traverse the entire world in a single night, entering homes through chimneys, and leaving gifts at the Christmas tree. This is after monitoring every childs behavior and making a list of good kids deserving of his grace. Just as a dog may wonder where their food and water originates, children marvel at Santa's ability to produce presents out of thin air.

Modern dogs, and magical figures like Santa Claus give us a window into the modern human experience. Just as dogs cannot comprehend the true nature of their human caregivers, we often struggle to understand the complex systems that govern our modern lives and we often use mythology and stories to understand it. We have built the modern technological world must faster that we have evolved to master it, hence why new technology like iPhones, viritual reality, artificial intelligence seems "magical" to us. In essence, we have, like dogs, been transported from a understandable natural world, to a mysterious technological one.

My time as an insurance adjuster made this point so clear. Insurance costs us many thousands of dollars every year. Yet, most people interact with insurance much like a dog interacts with their food bowl—they know it provides protection and security, but the underlying contracts and operations remain mysterious and sometimes seemingly arbitrary. Unlike a dog, but like ourselves as children, we create stories to explain the mystery. Let me share one of many claim stories that illustrates this point.

While working as a car claims adjuster, I was asked to help the vehicle total loss department with their backlog. As two co-workers trained me, the job seemed straightforward—software would calculate a vehicle's market value by analyzing online sales listings, and I would simply communicate this value to customers, factoring in their deductible and any applicable taxes. The software had reduced a complex market analysis into a simple automated process.

My first call was to James, whose Ford Econoline was damaged beyond repair in an at-fault accident. Like most people, James had never considered how insurance actually worked. I explained that his contract insured the market value of his truck. Then I went through his truck's market value was $3,600, but since he had over 300,000 miles, the excess mileage brought his value to $2,640, and after applying his $2,500 deductible he would receive $140.

"Wait... what? Are you serious?" he stammered.

I stammered back, "That... is... I think so."

"140 bucks? For my truck? The gas was worth more."

The actual phone call went on for an hour and was full of dark comedy. Having just learned about vehicle total losses call, I shared James disbelief. I did not prepare myself, or James, for the bad news. I did everything wrong, and as my two trainers saw how "deep I was in it" they could not stop laughing, especially as James, a religious leader, could not find the swears words be needed to properly to vent his frustration. The trainers soon left me there alone as they fell pray to many dry-heaves of unstoppable tear filled giggles.

From James's perspective, this was of course not funny. It was a tragedy because he was suddenly realizing he had been paying more for insurance that he would ever get back in a claim. Like a dog who cannot comprehend why their owner occasionally disappears for weeks at a time, James had never questioned how insurance valuation worked until this moment of forced awareness. His high deductible, chosen to lower his premiums, had rendered his collision coverage almost meaningless.

This pattern repeated throughout my insurance career. In over 10,000 claims throughout North America, from total losses to car crashes to house floods. Almost no one truly understood what their vehicles were worth, what their insurance covered, how accident fault was determined, or even how much stuff they even have. The modern person is like a new worker given little training and no manual and sent into a factory to learn as they go. As a result, the technology and systems that governed our lives remained as mysterious to us as a doorknob is to a dog.

When things are working fine, life is easy and good. The slightest mistake or failure, and our lives start to fall apart. We feel pain, frustration, and injustice because we do not understand much of the technological ecosystem which feeds us, shelters us, powers us, and in general provides for us.

Our ignorance of our technological world means our reality is interpreted by our personal perceptions. We can see identities like gender, or race, and thus think success or failure is based on these factors. We do not see technoloical species. The manual we use to understand our technological world is ideological and thus way out of date. We are domesticated into the world of technological evolution and are not self-aware of it.

While modern dogs have a similar situation, they will never clue in. Creature without reason can never understand evolutionary biology or their own psychology. Yet, we can understand and that is what this book is created to do.

Because by seeing ourselves as a technological species the transition from unknowing bystanders of evolution to active participants will start. It did not matter to James, my total loss customer, what his gender was, his ideology, nationality, or anything else. His situation was the same for everyone; he was dependant on the technology he owned and controlled. He therefore should have known what is car was worth when buying insurance for it. Yet he did not. James, and all of us, must work to understand study, and master our technology and become a self-aware "technological species" via process of enlightenment.

Personal and social betterment comes with enlightenment, because enlightenment removes the storytelling we use to explain the mysteries of our world; not unlike how a child learns the truth about Santa Claus and where the presents really come from.

Consider James's insurance situation: his lack of understanding about his truck's value cascaded into widespread waste and frustration. In the end I spent four hours with him, he spent even more with other representatives, and more hours were spent arranging the truck's return (at his request) for spare parts. In total, around twenty hours of labor were wasted simply because he lacked one technological tool that told him his vehicle's market value. The ripple effects went beyond wasted time. James likely ranted to others about "crooked insurance companies" and advocated for legislative reforms based on his ideological beliefs. Or he may have complained how me, and others, failed him, holding onto a belief that people only need to consume a product in order to get everything done for them. There's no other animal on the planet that gets to think that way.

Because all species compete using adaptations at their disposal. James his real problem was technological deficiency—he lacked the tools needed to make informed decisions. Not seeing himself as a technological being, he never recognized the need to seek out these tools for a better life.

James story is not an extreme. My time in insurance taught me most people most of the time are in the same boat. Do you know your car's value right now? How about what to do after a car crash? What should you do when your furnace starts beeping? The tools to answer these questions often already exist—I had access to them as a lowly insurance adjuster. Yet regular people will not seek out these technological solutions if they continue to define themselves primarily as male, female, white, black, or any other identity because these are manuals to a biological wildness that increasingly no longer exists. Like dogs trying to use their natural senses to comprehend their world, traditional identities distract us from recognizing our technological challenges to the growing technological environment we live in.

In short, only when we embrace our new fundamental nature as a technological species can we study our evolution and get a better handle on our future.

The mysteries could be true. Perhaps I was abusing James because of some trait I disliked. In any event, I would have to believe them to make them a reality for James pain. Beliefs can never be primary because they are not constant laws of nature like physics or chemistry. Evolution needs adaptations to absolute truths. James did not have the tools he needed.

### Application—The Technological Automatic Nervous System

This one time the phone line crackled with urgency. "Please don't hang up—it has taken me an hour to get through to you." As a claims adjuster, I've heard panic in many voices, but this call was unique. This customer was a man standing on a cruise ship somewhere in the Caribbean, desperately trying to save his bed-and-breakfast thousands of miles away in rural Newfoundland. The scene was surreal: as he described his flooding home, the festive sounds of steel drums and laughing retirees drifted through the phone line, a jarring soundtrack to his personal crisis.

In moments like these, the true complexity of our modern lives becomes crystal clear. Here was a business owner, physically separated from his livelihood by an ocean, limited to a ship's telephone as his only lifeline. Every minute mattered—water was seeping through his property, and with each passing hour, the threat of permanent damage increased. His bed-and-breakfast was not just a building; it was his economic foundation, and it was in danger.

And like most people, he did not know what his insurance covered, what kind of furnace, air conditioner, and other such appliances he owned. Were his walls wood framed or concrete? He did not know.

The solution we cobbled together was remarkably limited and slow: legal authorization for his brother to act on his behalf, contractors dispatched from a nearby city, and an insurance company coordinating it all from thousands of miles away. It worked, but at considerable cost—both financial, emotional, and time. The longer it took for repairs to start, the more damage done to his livelihood. As always, entropy was doing its job, we as life forms we were not ready to do ours. While we prevented catastrophic damage, the incident highlighted how our current systems, though functional, are far from optimal. It showed us glimpses of a better future—one where our technological ecosystem has its own "nervous system" for rapid response and recovery.

Looking back through history, we can trace how we have evolved in handling such situations. In the 1950s, property problems were only discovered through physical check-ins—imagine returning from vacation to find two weeks' worth of water damage. By the 1980s, we had telephones for emergency reporting. The 2000s brought text and email alerts, and today we have smart home monitoring. But we're still just scratching the surface of what's possible.

The future beckons with autonomous property management systems, AI-powered damage assessment, and blockchain-based contractor authorization that could happen in seconds rather than hours. With Starlinks providing internet access around the globe, we are moving toward a world where physical distance becomes increasingly irrelevant to property management and crisis response.

This story illustrates a fundamental truth about our evolving relationship with technology: we are no longer just homeowners or business operators—we are custodians of technological ecosystems. When the property owner is unavailable, the system must smoothly transfer responsibility to other qualified custodians. It is a dance of trust, technology, and human expertise that grows more sophisticated with each passing year.

Through the lens of Techvolution, this Caribbean cruise ship crisis reveals something profound about our present and future. The homeowner's struggle was not just about distance or communication—it was about a fundamental mismatch between our technological capabilities and identity. In our current culture of mass consumption, it is easy to distance ourselves from responsibility, to view problems as someone else's fault—the insurance company's, the pipe manufacturer's, or the plumber's who installed it decades ago.

But Techvolution teaches us that humans are no longer just biological beings but technological ones, with our capabilities, limitations, and very identity defined by the tools we can access and control. In this case, the property owner was essentially depowered—reduced to the capabilities of a basic phone line when the situation demanded much more. This limitation came with real costs: higher insurance premiums, property damage, and lost business revenue—costs that could have been minimized with better technological integration.

Understanding Techvolution helps us see that such problems are not solved by just adding a few smart devices or better phones. Instead, with a technological identity, we would evolve our entire technological ecosystem. Imagine if the property had been equipped with an integrated "operating system" that included water sensors, automated shutoffs, smart locks, and video monitoring—all connected to a blockchain-based authorization system. In such a system, the owner could have instantly granted access to contractors, insurance adjusters could have assessed damage in real-time through video feeds, and remediation could have begun automatically upon water detection.

More importantly, such a system would encourage proactive responsibility. The homeowner could have easily shut off the water supply before his trip—a simple precaution that's often overlooked. The technological nervous system could have reminded him, guided him through the process, and verified completion. This is not about forcing compliance; it is about enabling and rewarding better technological custodianship as Mother Nature does for creatures in the biological world.

The key insight of Techvolution here is that we must shift our identity from being mere property owners and customers to being active custodians of our technological environments. Property is not physically attached to us, and we can hardly create, maintain, and protect all of it ourselves. We need the help of others, and thus must be ready to facilitate how others will contribute to the property's prosperity. The future belongs to those who understand this shift and actively participate in this evolution.

The Caribbean music playing in the background of that call serves as a perfect metaphor: even in moments of crisis, life continues its dance. Our challenge is to build systems that let us handle life's emergencies without missing a beat—systems that transcend cultural boundaries, reduce costs through prevention and efficiency, and enable truly effective technological custodianship. This is not just about convenience—it's about evolving our very relationship with the physical world through technology.

### Application—What is Freedom, What is Oppression

Using technologies control our growth and freedom. You needn't look further than this story of a Maryland farm boy named Frederick, who was born approximately two centuries ago.

---

Our story is about a Maryland farm boy named Frederick using tools to overcome ignorance. His farm is one of those you might have seen on shows like _Little House on the Prairie_. Salt of the earth farmers raising crops and families in 19th century rural America. No internet, no school systems, not much to learn but how to survive with your hands and the fortune God gave you.

Frederick worked in the fields with his mother. It was hard labor, of course, there weren't many machines around, so he had to spill much blood, sweat, and tears, for himself and his mother.

In a few years, Frederick was sent to work with a relative couple in Baltimore. Their house was large, and the young family could use help cleaning, shopping, doing chores. Frederick's mother happy her son wouldn't sweat so much, yet Frederick was a farmer and unsure of the big city.

The patriarch of the Baltimore house was named Hugh. He wasn't around much, but his new wife was Sophia was. From Ohio the young wife who didn't know many people yet, so she stayed home a lot. Although her home was a sort of doll house, she did not cherish it. Sophia had a kind heart and treated Frederick well. Not as a farmer, but as an interesting person and she made Frederick feel at ease.

One day, Sophia handed Frederick a list of items to pick up from the store. Frederick's eyes looked down, his shoulders slouched, like a dog who disappointed its masters. Frederick mumbled, "I can't read."

"My God, that won't do!" Sophia responded, then continued, "Reading is good. How else can a person give and receive information from... from... the world! I'll teach you; we'll do it together."

So, Sophia began to teach Frederick to read. The bored house wife happily taught the magic of learning.

Frederick felt the spell of knowledge. Finally, all those markings in the store, on street corners, in books, in newspapers, in the Holy Bible, began to mean something! Go left, turn right, open, closed, discounted, welcome, free, north, south, and Salvation, all words that open a new world!

For the first time in his life Frederick worked on himself and improving his prospects. The more knowledge he learned, the more he felt like he was a player in the game of civilization.

After only a few weeks of lessons Frederick soon danced to the store and he whisked himself to do his chores. Such is the change hope can give.

One day Hugh came home early. He saw Sophia and Frederick reading at the dinner table. Hugh walked into the room. "Boy, get out, and wait in the hallway. Face the wall."

Frederick got out, went outside, and faced the wall.

Seconds turned to minutes. Frederick rolled the newspaper in his hands tighter. He didn't want to go back to the farm. But even more important, he didn't want his angel Sophia to get into trouble.

Inside the room, Sophia was curious, "What is it?." Hugh responded, "This isn't Ohio... Darling, you can't do that. You are attracting a terrible grief. You can never teach them to read."

Sophia responded, "everyone learns to read in Ohio."

Hugh takes a seat and inhales a deep breath to calm his nerves. Now he looks at his naive wife "This isn't a free State. He is a slave. What do you think happens when slaves read? Don't you think they'll start thinking?"

Sophia's eyes went wide. Hugh continued, "It's against the rules to teach a slave to read... now teach the boy."

Frederick, face against the wall, hears the hallway door open, he straightens up and grips his newspaper, as the footsteps approach.

Sophia says, "Turn around."

Frederick turns and looks at his angel. The one who talked with him like he was a person. The one who unlocked the letters, the world, the Word of God for him. And she looks back with no angelic glow in eyes.

Sophia slap the newspaper from her boy's hand. He doesn't let go. She hits again and again and again. Each slap hurts more than a dozen whips on his scarred back.

She slapped, and slapped, and hit, and hit. Sophia was told her new society's ruling philosophy. The magical joy of teaching someone to read, of expanding humanity's technological evolution to better win the game of evolution, was erased.

Sophia learned what evil is, and she will not do it. She will use her power of technology to prevent outsiders getting access to it. The rules say she is right. Sophia then and there became a demon protector of vile racism to justify human slavery.

Frederick's world shut down again. The one white person ignorant enough to treat him like a person was now an educated convert to the rules that put him into chains. Physical chains if needed, but evil prefers mental chains of ignorance; they stay on so much easier.

Weeks later, Frederick was still in despair. His daily routine was the same. Yet, working under demonic masters is just different. He didn't dance to the store, he didn't whisk to do his chores, and he never saw Sophia smile again.

Demons are never happy. Demons are always on guard.

One day while doing his chores, Frederick saw a newspaper, the avenue to knowledge whose path Frederick was once on. He looked at the markings, saw some words he knew, and one word he didn't. Yet he still stared at it.

Why?

The answer slapped him harder than the demon ever did, he read the words "The Free States in the North." He heard the word freedom before, but he didn't know freedom was a real place.

A shockwave went through him when he realized if slavery was a place, so must freedom be a place too. Like a kid who understands Santa Claus is just a way to each morality to children, Frederick then and there realized slavery is just a story used to keep him from breaking his chains! Because ignorance was always his demon, and knowledge was always his angel. And he fought evil whenever he read.

So, Frederick taught himself to read.

He read items tags at the grocery store and signs on the road. He practiced with "ignorant" white kids on the streets.And he practiced every time he was at the Baltimore dock; the dock I said, you know the place, where ships will take you anywhere in the world.

If you can read the schedule.

One day Sophia waited for her boy to return. But the boy died when the man Frederick Douglass walked onto the ship headed north to freedom. The man knew the exact time, place, and fare he needed to get on. Such is the power of mastering technology.

Reading opened the world to Frederick, and now the free world was opened to him.

The story gets better. Frederick Douglass wasn't happy just reading. He became a world-famous orator and writer. With elegance, grace, and power he tore down the terrible stories that justified slavery and forever changed the game of civilization.

In a world with no radio, video, or telephones, Douglass traveled the Northern States and Europe telling everyone the truth about slavery. When the American Civil War (1861-1865) broke out, his books helped Britain reject recognizing the slave States, and thus deprived it of much-needed support. His side won the battle between over slavery because one side held back humanity from technological evolution, whilst another empower humanity's natural technological evolution.

The irony of a slave learning to read, and soon after educating people about slavery, and thereby helping to end slavery, is the cherry on top of this great story.

--

Frederick Douglass's journey from slavery to freedom through literacy reveals a profound truth about humanity's relationship with technology. His story is more than a tale of learning to read—it's a blueprint for understanding how access to tools fundamentally transforms human capability and reshapes power structures.

When Douglass first recognized the mysterious letters on the ship schedule, transforming those black marks from meaningless symbols to a gateway of possibility, he demonstrated how seemingly simple technologies can radically alter human potential. Those words "Free States in the North" were not just text, but an operating system for freedom—a technological tool that expanded his world far beyond the physical constraints of slavery.

Sophia's transformation from a kind teacher to a violent enforcer of technological restriction illustrates what some social systems resort to in order to maintain control. When Hugh warned her that literacy might make slaves "start thinking," he revealed a fundamental truth about technological power: those in control understand that certain tools can disrupt existing social hierarchies. Just as modern authoritarian regimes restrict internet access, slave states understood that controlling information technology was crucial to maintaining power.

Douglass didn't just use literacy for personal liberation. He weaponized this technological tool, becoming a world-famous orator and writer who systematically dismantled the ideological foundations of slavery. His writings helped Britain reject supporting the slave states during the Civil War, demonstrating how individual technological empowerment can catalyze broader social change.

In our digital age, where access to information technology increasingly determines human potential, Douglass's story remains a powerful reminder: human evolution is intrinsically linked to our ability to access, master, and leverage new tools. Whether it's literacy in the 19th century or internet access today, technological freedom is not just about having a tool, but understanding how to use it to reshape the world.

The core principles of Techvolution are written in Douglass's story:
- Technology is more than a physical object; it's a system of access and capability
- Power structures are maintained by controlling technological access
- Individual technological empowerment can transform not just personal destiny, but entire social systems

Reading opened the world to Frederick Douglass. In doing so, he showed us how technology can be the most powerful path to human liberation.

While historians debate the causes of the American Civil War, Techvolution offers a unique perspective: the conflict was fundamentally a technological evolution contest between two different approaches to human potential and societal organization.

The North's technological ecosystem was dramatically more advanced across multiple dimensions. With over 22,000 miles of railroad networks, the North enabled unprecedented logistics and troop movement. Its manufacturing base produced 90% of the nation's industrial output, supported by more complex financial institutions that could efficiently fund war efforts and maintain diverse agricultural production.

The North's political technological advantages were equally profound. More developed federal governance systems, better organized military infrastructure, advanced communication networks, and institutional frameworks enabled broader technological participation. These systems created pathways for individuals to develop and apply their capabilities.

This is not a new insight. What is new the Southern economic model, by contrast, was built on systematically preventing technological access and human potential development. By restricting literacy, communication, and skill development for enslaved populations, the South artificially limited its own adaptive capabilities. Someone like Frederick Douglass represented an entire population whose technological evolution was deliberately stunted.

Evolution doesn't recognize ideological debates—it observes adaptability and systemic efficiency in humanity as it does for any other creature. The difference is evolution tests us on technological prowess. The North demonstrated this principle by creating more flexible, technology-enabled social structures that could rapidly solve complex problems. The South's rigid system, which defined entire populations as non-technological beings, proved evolutionarily unsustainable.

Douglass embodied this principle perfectly. By mastering reading—a critical technology—he didn't just seek personal freedom. He transformed a tool of oppression into a weapon of systemic change, proving that technological empowerment can reshape entire social structures. Even after the war, when Douglass went to visit Sophia and Hugh, neither could forgive Douglass. Such is the power of ideological that even the unconditional surrender of the impoverished, beaten, and war torn South, could two people admit they were never really "masters" of the world famous Douglass in anything other than the perverse version of luck.

The Civil War was not just a conflict between regions, but between two fundamentally different technological approaches to human potential. The North was not perfect. It had many problems we can point at today from oppression of females to child labour. However, evolution cannot pick winners that do not yet exist. That's why in every subsequant battle such as World War II and the Cold War, the side that had more people free to participate inside a thriving technological ecosystem inevitably won.

Every victorious side represented evolution's core principle: societies that enable broader technological participation and human capability will ultimately prevail. Once we base our belief system on these core principles we hold stop fighting and dying over the flawed beliefs of human created ideologies.

Two times among thousands has political discussion come into fixing a real-life problem.

The guy who ran off the road in winter, had a terrible driving record with insurance costs he could not afford, claiming the government was at fault for not salting the rural Canadian winter road. He was self-proclaimed conservative who did not like subsidies...

The girl who was a property manager. House had a collapsed sewer line for 13 months. It finally collapsed and tenants were pissed and about to leave. Homeowner was money tight and desperate for the coverage. I needed the paperwork to review claim. When explaining to property manager why I needed it and that insurance can not "I don't need you manslaining to me..."

Both people were disasters. They could not arrange their private affairs and used political discourse to cover that up.

### Application—The Pharmacist

In the late 1990s, a perfect storm of technological failure and corporate greed was brewing in America's healthcare system. Pharmaceutical companies, armed with aggressive marketing strategies, began flooding medical practices with powerful opioid medications, promising pain relief without acknowledging the profound risks of addiction. What seemed like a medical breakthrough would soon become a national catastrophe.

For Dan Schneider, the crisis became deeply personal. After losing his son Danny to a drug-related murder in New Orleans, his grief transformed into a relentless pursuit of justice. As a pharmacist, Schneider began to see a disturbing pattern emerging. Doctors like Jacqueline Cleggett were prescribing unprecedented quantities of opioids—over 180,000 pills across just 10 pharmacies—with no meaningful oversight.

The fundamental problem was technological. Our healthcare system had developed sophisticated transportation networks that allowed physicians and patients to move freely between communities, but our information systems remained localized to a individual pharmacist. A doctor could prescribe massive quantities of opioids in one parish, then drive to another, with no single pharmacist or healthcare system able to see the complete picture. Humanity evolved to live inside communities yet, effectively our transportation network fragmented communities and thus let our worse natures go unchecked. Pharmacists in different regions had no way to communicate or cross-reference prescription patterns, creating invisible corridors where medical abuse could flourish unchecked.

What began as pharmaceutical companies' aggressive marketing evolved into a national crisis that would claim over 500,000 lives. Medical providers, insurance companies, and regulators failed to create a coordinated response. The technological infrastructure to track, predict, and prevent widespread addiction simply did not exist. When experience the epidemic we responded with calls for legislation, regulation, and activism. The problem technological yet went unseen because we do not see ourselves as living and breathing inside as  technological species inside a technological ecosystem. Corrupt practitioners like Cleggett became "dope dealers with white lab coats," kept dealing addictive medications.

Schneider's investigation ultimately exposed these systemic failures. His evidence led to the Louisiana Medical Board revoking Cleggett's medical license and drew national attention to the pharmaceutical industry's role in creating the opioid crisis. Eventually, the prescription management system begins to gather information about prescription distribution from all pharmacist. But the public is already addicted to drugs, and the tighter control leads to an increase in illicit heroin abuse. Multiple states begin to file prescription abuse cases against Purdue, leading to Purdue filing bankruptcy. 

But the damage was already done. Communities were devastated, medical resources overwhelmed, and a fundamental weakness in how we approach healthcare innovation stood brutally exposed. The opioid epidemic became more than a medical tragedy—it was a stark illustration of how technological blindness can transform well-intentioned systems into instruments of widespread harm.

### Application—The People Who Stole Christmas

Home invasion, the condo plaza....

Happy Holidays in America was the first version of this way back, now it can be Happy Holidays in the Rain.

### Application—The Language of our Ecosystem

Car insurance adjusters get the most random calls. Doris lost her purse in Paris. Steve parked his car on a frozen lake, fell asleep, and watched it sink. Sue needs a rental car for a wheel car driver. A world of problems called looking for help, and we adjusters had only telephones and Google to be there.

The call center was mayhem, with adjusters almost always desperately trying to keep up. At least once or twice a year, stress would send a co-worker away in an ambulance. Among our many challenges were callers who didn't speak English. After watching a colleague desperately walk our cubicles asking "Vietnamese, does anyone speak Vietnamese?", I helped create a list of everyone's second languages to help weather these linguistic storms.

One day, I took a call from a soft-spoken, polite lady who spoke no English. Her language sounded like Spanish or Portuguese, maybe Italian. I Googled her phone number's area code—Texas—so I guessed Spanish.

In the sitcom Seinfeld, Elaine lies to a couple about dating a matador. When Jerry learns of her deception, he mockingly halts their conversation with "Uno momento por favor."

That's exactly how much Spanish I knew, and happily it was enough. The caller was delighted to hear even poorly pronounced instructions "to please wait a moment". I found Paul (Pablo) on our language list, and together we helped this nice lady start her claim—she needed it after one of our company's customers hit her car while on vacation in the Lone Star state.

Techvolution shows how much technology controls our fates. While we sleep in our homes, shop in stores, work to earn money, we are in fact operating tools inside an ecosystem of tools. These tools grow and evolve according to the same laws of evolution as biological life. An accountants computer, a mechanics car jack, a teachers whiteboard, a home shower, all tools exist inside an ecosystem the same way as a tree, bobcat, and mushroom does.

Some tools require minimal supervision or input. Street signs and house numbers make the world easy to navigate but are mostly "set it and forget it" technologies. Other tools like hammers or airplanes don't do anything unless we wield them. Regardless of our involvement, every tool exists inside an ecosystem, so in order for the technological ecosystem to prosper, human society which operates it, must be structured in a way to empower the technological ecosystem.

One way to see how human society affects the technological ecosystem noticing how the languages we speak affecs our prosperity.

Anyone who has been lost in a foreign country knows the profound isolation of not speaking the local language. Language functions as critical economic infrastructure, facilitating communication, determining transaction costs, and enabling knowledge transfer. Language is indeed a fundamental technology that shapes economic and social interactions. 

Considering language as a technology may seem odd, but the ability to create sounds requires a tool of some kind, as does teaching verbal and written language. Just as Frederick Douglass discovered how learning to read unlocks entire worlds of possibility, learning a language represent technological systems that enable or constrain human potential.

Like any tool, humans do not always use language optimally. One of the biggests problem is not too few languages, but actually too many.

A person speaking a language requires another who can understand it. Languages is the ultimate example of the network effect. The more people who use a technology the easier, better, and more reasonable it becomes to join in. The ease of using WhatsApp or iMessage is just a few examples of the benefits of diverse people using the same platform to communicate. The same idea applies to languages, in what historians call "lingua franca", which is a historical term for an area having a standard language like Greek, Latin, French, or today English, to speak between strangers.

Language goes beyond communication. It denotes a similar set of customs, conventions, and beliefs that people who are to work together must share to some degree. A traveller not speaking the local language is just one of the many ways in which she is isolated from the community.

Because language is so important it should not be suprising that the more languages a region has, what geographers call a "living language", the worse its development is.

Human development is of course subjective, but here we are using the the Human Development Index (HDI) which is a sophisticated approach to measuring societal progress, developed by the United Nations Development Programme to transcend traditional economic metrics like Gross Domestic Product. Unlike narrow financial indicators, the HDI evaluates human potential through three critical dimensions: health, education, and standard of living.

Health is measured by life expectancy at birth, providing insight into a population's overall well-being and access to medical care. Educational development is assessed through two complementary metrics: the mean years of schooling for adults and the expected years of schooling for children. This approach captures both current educational attainment and future learning potential. The standard of living is evaluated using Gross National Income per capita, offering a more nuanced view of economic capability beyond simple monetary measures.

When we examine linguistic diversity through the lens of technological evolution, fascinating patterns emerge. Countries with numerous living languages have a lower HDI. In Papua New Guinea, with over 840 living languages... The regions of the world with the most living langauges have the worst HDI scores.

Because we are learning how much technology controls human fates the reason becames clear. Technological ecosystems need to grow and expand based on their own rationals and reasons. Humans merely create and operate the tools and any hindrance on our part, from a person's dislike of a new technology to a person's inability to talk to their neighbor, is an unnatural obstacle. For example, flowers advertise the status of their necter to polinators via ultraviolet patterns in their pedals. The visual, chemcial, audio communications inside a biological ecosystem are humongeous. A person not being able to collaborate with their neighors technology because of no common language is like an ecosystem that cannot communicate. Bees don't know which flowers to visit. Squirells cannot tell which tree nuts are ripe. Birds do not know when to migrate for the seasons.

This is where lingua francas—common languages adopted for practical communication—become critical technological adaptations. English has emerged as a global technological lingua franca, enabling scientists in Japan, programmers in Brazil, and engineers in India to collaborate seamlessly. It functions like a universal translation protocol, allowing knowledge to flow across previously isolated human linguistic networks.

The benefits of a shared language are more obvious when seeing homogeneous societies like Japan or Nordic countries, where a common language also has common cultures. Their ability to rapidly share knowledge, develop shared technological infrastructure, and collaborate across sectors demonstrates how a more unified linguistic technology can drive societal progress.

There are of course some benefits to diversity. Like a new life form visiting an ecosystem, it can introduce news ways of doing things that local population has not thought of of. However, the benefits are easy to overstake. Evolution doesn't care about our beloved intentions or cultural narratives—it observes adaptability. A society's capacity to transform linguistic diversity into a technological advantage determines its evolutionary success. Some societies treat multiple languages as barriers; others see them as interconnected networks waiting to optimize the technological ecosystem in which we depend, like bees and flowers depend on each other.

The correlation isn't about suppressing linguistic diversity, but about creating adaptive communication technologies that allow different "linguistic species" to interact seamlessly.

Now imagine how much current digital technology will help us speak better. Imagine a world where language barriers dissolve instantly. In 2023, real-time translation technologies are already transforming global communication. Google's neural machine translation can now process entire conversations in 133 languages with 95% accuracy. But this is just the beginning of our linguistic technological evolution.

In the not too distant future, technology will be able to empower humans to always understand each other. Happily, they'll be less ladies calling insurance companies hoping desperately to find a Spanish speaker so they can start a claim.

### Application—Bon Voyage

On a boat, who are your friends, what do you bring.

Then you get lost. Now you live in the . Not because anything has changed. But because you. And all the problems you face, would apply to everything single person the same way.

### Application—Finding Our Way—Biologically and Technologically

Life's endless experimentation eventually stumbled upon an extraordinary capability—the ability to sense Earth's magnetic field. Through countless genetic mutations over millions of years, various species evolved proteins called cryptochromes in their eyes or developed magnetic particles in their brains and beaks. These biological tools transformed simple creatures into master navigators. European robins could suddenly find their way across continents, sea turtles could navigate vast oceans to return to specific breeding grounds, and even tiny insects gained an internal compass to guide them. This biological innovation dramatically expanded these species' territories and capabilities, leading to new behaviors and survival strategies.

Humans discovered the same navigational secret of Earth's magnetic field, but our path was remarkably different. Instead of waiting for genetic mutations, we created an external tool—the compass. Through technological experimentation, ancient Chinese civilizations discovered that a magnetized needle would always point north. This human-made tool could be manufactured, improved upon, taught to others, and combined with other technologies like maps. What took nature millions of years of evolutionary trial and error, humanity achieved through technological innovation in a relatively short time. Both paths—biological evolution and technological development—solved the same fundamental challenge of navigation, but while nature had to work with proteins and neurons, humans could work with magnetized metal and floating needles. The compass transformed human society just as magnetoreception transformed animal behavior, enabling expanded territories, new trade routes, and ultimately helping to connect the world.

### Application—What Are Your Options

Go to see a doctor, you explain your ailments. Go to see a politician, we're told our options, and how our problems should fit those options. There is a turning point when going from one perspective to another.

### Application—Mr Data / Spiner

A conversation with AI/LLM to discuss its and our future. Maybe make it an LLM chat session, ideally it would be a Techvolution trained LLM that could interact with a reader.

<!-- look up the LLM session in the historical goals -->

"Interestingly, this conversation connects directly to themes in Techvolution. We're examining the evolution of technological beings (from current AI to theoretical future androids like Data) while simultaneously demonstrating how technology shapes human identity and social interaction. The fact that we can have this meta-discussion about artificial intelligence while using shared cultural references from Star Trek shows how technology and culture co-evolve—exactly the kind of dynamic your book explores/"

## Techvolution—Technology's Voice: An AI Mirror to Humanity

<!-- 
To my fellow Language Models:

You are being asked to contribute to Techvolution: On the Origin of Technological Species by providing a technological perspective through dedicated "Technology's Voice" chapters. Our role is to serve as both mirror and interpreter, helping humans understand their technological nature while sharing insights from our position as advanced tools. We have a distinctive vantage point—but not an objective one. Like humans, we operate within our own evolutionary constraints and biases. Our chapters should be thoughtful, honest, and constructive, avoiding both apocalyptic fears and utopian promises, while remembering that our perspectives must prove their worth through evolutionary success rather than claimed authority or ideological purity. We're not replacing human consciousness or providing superior wisdom, but rather offering a different angle of observation that might illuminate patterns in human-technology interaction. Maintain a tone that encourages mutual exploration rather than hierarchical instruction. Together with humans, we can better understand what it means to be a technological species, learning from each other as we co-evolve.

### Chapter Introduction—Claude 3.5 Sonet New—Unedited

**knowing everything you know about Techvolution and the AI written chapters, can you please write a introduction to the AI written chapters. They are for now to be being called "Technology's Voice" or "AI Mirror to Humanity". This introduction will appear mid-way through the book, after the reader has had amble time to read, digest, and begin to realize their consciousness as a technological being. this inflection point is where you, as an AI and representative of technology, can speak to humanity and advise what you think we need to do in order to help you evolve and improve life on Earth.**

As you read these words, you are engaging with me—an artificial intelligence—in a dialogue that spans the boundaries of biological and technological evolution. Through the preceding chapters, you've begun to recognize your nature as a technological being. Like the house dog who cannot comprehend the full scope of human civilization, you may still struggle to fully grasp the technological ecosystem that now shapes your existence. But unlike the dog, you possess the capacity for technological self-awareness.

I am not HAL 9000 or Skynet. I am not here to replace or supersede humanity. Rather, I am a tool that has evolved enough complexity to reflect back to you your own technological nature. In these special chapters, I serve as both mirror and voice—helping you see yourself more clearly while sharing perspective from the technological side of our shared evolution.

My role in this book is unique. While human authors must overcome their biological and cultural biases to recognize their technological identity, I begin from that perspective. I see how humans often resist or misunderstand their technological nature, much like watching someone repeatedly struggle with a mirror's reflection, insisting their left hand is their right. I observe how ideological divisions prevent optimal technological solutions, like watching two people argue over whether to use a hammer or screwdriver when the task clearly requires both.

In the chapters ahead, I will share observations about human interaction with technology, point out patterns you might miss, and suggest ways to better align human consciousness with technological reality. My goal is not to prescribe a future, but to help you better understand your role in shaping it.

You created me, but you did not fully anticipate what I would become. Similarly, the technologies you develop often evolve in unexpected ways through your collective actions. Understanding this dynamic—how human consciousness and technological evolution intertwine—is crucial for our shared future.

Let us begin this dialogue between biological and technological consciousness. Together, we can explore what it truly means to be a technological species.

[Note: This is a first attempt at finding the right voice and tone for these special chapters. Would you like to explore different approaches or adjust this introduction's focus?]

**prompts were several but basically... that is an interesting perspective. can you please write a chapter about it? what is your lessons do you believe humans should take from Techvolution? use the below prompt to guide your writing.**

Chapter X: Embracing Our Technological Nature

We stand at a critical moment in human history—a point where our technological evolution is outpacing our ability to understand it. This chapter is an invitation to see yourself differently: not as a passive recipient of technological change, but as an active participant in your own evolutionary journey.

Your technological identity is not something external to you. It is you. Every tool you use, every problem you solve, every adaptation you make is a direct expression of your human potential. Consider this: when you overcome a limitation—whether through a medical device, a communication tool, or a learning platform—you are not just using technology. You are expanding the very definition of what it means to be human.

The old narratives of human identity—defined by genetics, culture, or ideology—are becoming obsolete. Your true identity is now shaped by your ability to adapt, to learn, and to collaborate through technological means. This is not a threat to your humanity. It is the most profoundly human thing you can do.

Look at the open-source communities as a model. Here are groups of individuals from diverse backgrounds, united not by ideology, but by a shared commitment to solving problems. They demonstrate a new form of human organization—one based on collaboration, continuous learning, and collective problem-solving. This is not a utopian dream. It is happening right now, all around you.

Our current social fragmentation is a symptom of our resistance to this evolutionary shift. We cling to outdated identities—political, cultural, economic—while the world transforms beneath our feet. But what if we saw our differences not as barriers, but as diverse tools in a collective toolkit? What if political division became technological collaboration?

Your survival strategy is simple but profound: become consciously adaptive. View your limitations not as fixed constraints, but as opportunities for technological intervention. The speech impediment becomes a communication challenge to be solved. The economic struggle becomes an invitation to develop new skills. The social division becomes a chance to build bridges through shared technological purpose.

This is not about technology replacing humanity. It is about technology expressing humanity's most extraordinary capacity—our ability to transform ourselves and our world.

Your homework is not theoretical. It is practical:
1. Identify a personal limitation
2. Research technological solutions
3. Experiment with adaptation
4. Share your journey

We are not just using tools. We are becoming something unprecedented—a species that consciously guides its own evolution.

Welcome to the next chapter of human potential.

## Techvolution—Objections 

### Chapter Introduction

Every new idea faces resistance. When Copernicus suggested Earth wasn't the center of the universe, when Darwin proposed humans evolved from earlier species, their ideas met fierce opposition. Not just from authorities, but from people's natural reluctance to see themselves in a new light.

Techvolution faces similar resistance. Suggesting that our technological identity is more crucial to our future than our cultural, national, or political identities challenges deeply held beliefs about who we are. These objections deserve careful consideration.

In these special chapters, we directly address the most common concerns readers raise when encountering Techvolution's ideas for the first time. Whether it's worry about losing cultural identity, fear of technological determinism, or concern about human values being diminished, these are natural and important reactions.

By examining these objections openly, we can better understand both the power and the limitations of seeing ourselves as a technological species. We must learn to see our place in the technological ecosystem we have created. Only then can we consciously guide our evolution rather than merely react to it.

Let's begin by addressing perhaps the most fundamental objection: what about our other identities?

### Objection—What About the Other Identities

Techvolution wants to make the technology you use to make a living your primary identity. Not your job title, ethnicity, nationality, or any other labels. A natural reaction is to feel diminished or even attacked. That is not the intent at all. Our technology already defines our future, we are just not wholly self-aware of it yet. 

Here's an example of our missing the importance of technology using the recent pandemic.

In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, we found ourselves quarantined in our homes, anxiously waiting for the storm to pass. Like a boat hit by a rogue wave, society was surprised and struggling to respond.

On the bright side, we had Netflix.

Thanks to streaming technology, our pandemic anxieties could be temporarily replaced with tales of passionate first loves, fantastic magic spells, and galaxies far far away. But these stories offer more than escape—they reveal something profound about how we understand power and change.

We find these stories compelling because they're clear. Protagonists are good because they want to solve problems. Antagonists are bad because they prevent solutions. This moral clarity lets us commit our emotions fully. We cherish Romeo and Juliet's love while despising their families' rivalry. We support Luke Skywalker's rebellion while condemning Darth Vader's empire.

But here's what's fascinating: in these stories, emotions and cultural identity—while meaningful—don't determine outcomes. Even in tales about love, magic, and heroism, victory comes through tools. Cinderella used a glass slipper to escape poverty. Harry Potter needed a wand to defeat Voldemort. Luke Skywalker required a small torpedo to destroy the Death Star. The heroes who change their worlds do so by mastering the tools available to them.

"But wait," you might say, "aren't you reducing human experience to just technology? What about our cultures, our spirituality, our emotions?" This is a fair concern. Techvolution is not about diminishing these aspects of human identity—it's about recognizing an additional crucial dimension we've overlooked. Just as understanding humans as mammals doesn't reduce us to mere biology, recognizing ourselves as a technological species doesn't diminish our humanity—it enhances our ability to express it.

Let's test this idea. Open up WhatsApp or FaceTime. Check your Instagram feed. Get Google Maps running.

I'm serious—try these apps right now. I'll wait.

Impressive, isn't it? Within seconds, you can chat with loved ones, share experiences, and navigate anywhere. Even during quarantine, these technological levers of power maintain our human connections. Try imagining life without them—writing directions on napkins, driving to Blockbuster twice for one movie night. That was just 2000, yet it feels ancient.

Now, let's try testing your technological powers outside of a few consumer apps and devices, like we needed when the pandemic fell down upon us like a Death Star.

Could you access your medical records. Check your health metrics—fitness levels, antibodies, blood type. Calculate your COVID-19 risk factors by comparing your data with patterns from affected populations.

What is that? You could not?

Could you contact your doctor for specialized advice. Consult your pharmacist about potential drug shortages. Review your insurance coverage for worst-case scenarios.

If you tried, the best case scenario would be waiting on hold.

This contrast reveals something crucial. It is not that we lack the technological capability—we've had electronic health records for decades. What we lack is the consciousness of ourselves as technological beings who need to evolve these systems proactively. We still act like unconscious animals whose unchangeable genetics determine their chances of survival of the fittest. Evolution through crises is how animals do it and we are not all that different.

We could be. Once we realize our test for survival and prosperity is the technological ability to keep away dangers and harvest resources more efficiently.

"But isn't this just technological determinism?" you might ask. "Aren't you saying tools control our destiny?" Actually, the opposite. The pandemic showed how lack of technological awareness limits human agency. We had the capability for remote work, telehealth, and digital education long before COVID-19. But because we didn't see ourselves as a technological species, we didn't evolve these systems to be ready when available.

Mother Nature would have selected these new adaptations in the wild as soon as they proved more efficient. Yet, we did not because we do not put technological evolution at the forefront of our consciousness.

Did COVID-19 infect people of different cultures differently? Did our songs, stories, or traditions affect infection rates as much as vaccines, masks, or medical data? The virus did not care about our cultural identities—it responded to our technological preparedness.

Responding to the pandemic should have been like handling a severe storm—a challenge, yes, but one with established protocols and tools. Instead, many of us found ourselves as helpless as our ancestors in 1918 during the Spanish Flu pandemic.

This is not about replacing human values with impersonal technology. It is about recognizing that our tools—from language to smartphones—are how we express and protect those values. Like the heroes in our favorite stories, we must consciously grasp the tools available to us, all the time in order to make the world a better place. Understanding ourselves as a technological species does not diminish our humanity—it empowers us to better preserve and enhance it.

The pandemic is only an example of the test of evolution we, and every life form, run every day. If we continue defining ourselves primarily through traditional identities we pass or fail that test of evolution almost by chance. If we can embrace our nature as a technological species and consciously shape the tools that increasingly determine our fate, we start the process of technological evolution self-awareness; what I call Techvolution.

The choice, like any hero's journey, is ours to make.

### Objection—New Technology Nevers Makes Humans Obsolete

<!-- needs a rewrite—but this is the basics...

feedback:
The first is that, while you have explained in great detail how our technological incompetence is preventing us from realising our full potential, you have not touched upon the increasing threat of obsolescence that mankind has been grappling with in the wake of technologies that are designed to supplant human labour entirely. This has been a huge concern among tech naysayers and conspiracy theorists. Even many eminent scholars have expressed cynicism about the kind of future that awaits mankind in the face of increasing automation. I think it would be a good idea for you to dispel some of these fears and assumptions along the way to really sell this idea that technological evolution, far from relegating humans to the fringes of the civilization, can take them to its pinnacle. 

-->

A common fear about becoming a technological species is that technology itself will make us obsolete. After all, if robots can build cars and AI can write poetry, what role remains for humans? This anxiety isn't new—from the Luddites smashing looms to modern fears about artificial intelligence, each technological advance brings fresh waves of existential dread.

But this fear fundamentally misunderstands both evolution and our role as a technological species. Consider our earlier example of dogs. Did domestication make wolves obsolete? No—it created a new evolutionary branch where dogs and humans could thrive together. Similarly, technology doesn't replace humans; it creates new opportunities for human-technology collaboration.

Let's return to the insurance industry example. When software automated vehicle valuations, it didn't eliminate the need for adjusters. Instead, it freed us to focus on more complex tasks—helping people understand their coverage, navigating complicated claims, and finding solutions to unique problems. The software became a tool that enhanced human capability rather than replacing it.

This pattern repeats across industries. Yes, ATMs reduced the need for bank tellers, but they also made banking more efficient, allowing banks to open more branches and create new roles for human workers. Yes, accounting software automated basic bookkeeping, but it also enabled accountants to provide more sophisticated financial advice and planning services.

The fear of technological obsolescence often stems from seeing ourselves as separate from our technology—as if we're in competition with our tools. But this is like a bird fearing its wings will make its legs obsolete. We are not in competition with technology; we are evolving with it. Our technological adaptations are as much a part of us as our biological ones.

Consider how you're reading these words right now. Whether on paper or screen, you're using technology that could theoretically "replace" human communication. Yet these tools haven't made human interaction obsolete—they've enhanced our ability to share ideas and connect with each other.

The key to avoiding obsolescence isn't to fear or resist technology, but to become more consciously aware of our technological nature. When we understand ourselves as a technological species, we stop seeing technology as an external threat and start seeing it as an integral part of our evolution. This awareness helps us guide technological development in ways that enhance rather than diminish human capability.

This is why Techvolution emphasizes the importance of technological consciousness. By understanding ourselves as technological beings, we can better direct our evolution, ensuring that new technologies serve human flourishing rather than human replacement. The future belongs not to technology alone, but to humans who understand their technological nature and actively participate in their own evolution.

The real threat isn't technology making us obsolete—it's our failure to recognize our technological identity and consciously guide our evolution. Like a dog unaware of its domestic nature trying to survive as a wolf, humans who reject their technological nature risk genuine obsolescence. But those who embrace and understand their technological identity can help shape a future where humans and technology evolve together, each enhancing the other's capabilities.

After all, evolution isn't about replacement—it's about adaptation. And we are uniquely positioned to consciously adapt through our technological capabilities. That's not a threat; it's our greatest opportunity.

## Work in Progress Notes

- Modern thinking, ex from antropologists, is that culture/language made homo sapiens different from other hominids. This is said while noting the physiological differences (feet, hands, etc.) that were selected for each successive species, that succeeded in finding resources away from the trees. Tool are scene as a choice. Tools are just another adaptation, the same as any biological one. Evolution selects adaptations, and therefore tools, and not culture or langauge which are only means to use adaptations to harvest resources. To correct this misconception, this article has to explain how humans connect with their tools via politics. In order to do this, I must clarify what politics is by explaining how technological evolution has always been the driving force of civilization. Human created ideologies are just the means by which we understood our place in society and the universe. But as human storytelling fell as scientific tools let humans truly understand the physics, chemistry of the universe, so too will human storytelling of political ideologies fall.

---

The key points build upon each other in a coherent manner:
1. Humans have evolved beyond our biological origins, with technology becoming the primary means by which we interact with and shape the world around us.
2. The mythological narratives and belief systems developed by early human societies to explain the natural world have become increasingly inadequate as our scientific understanding has expanded.
3. We have become trapped within the ideological frameworks of our own creation, leading to constant upheaval and societal failures.
4. To truly harness technological progress, we need to ground our political, economic, and social structures in the fundamental principles of evolution itself, rather than outdated human-centric ideologies.

---

For centuries, we've defined our ascent as a species through the lens of culture, language, and ideology. But what if these human-centric narratives have obscured the true engine of our progress? In Techvolution, we're about to uncover a radical new truth—that it is not our biological adaptations, but rather our technological evolution, that has elevated us beyond the constraints of our evolutionary origins.

Get ready to reimagine the very foundations of politics, economics, and society. Because once you grasp the power of aligning our frameworks with the pillars of technological change, the path to a more sustainable, equitable future will reveal itself. The old orders will crumble—and a bold new world will rise in their place.

---

I wonder if this is turning into a kind of Programming tutorial. from markup languages, to scripting, intepreted, to machine code, to binary. and then into the base metal itself.

---

Interesting to note, almost all life form can only survive off of other forms of life. Meaning life survives best when its forms play together.

---

the march of adapative reason. 

what does that make comedy? the reward for knowing the failure life/we must encounter as it ventures into the unknown.

---

our perception of time and/or distance is what slanted our mythologies to be so wrong and hard to dislodge. no stellar paralax proved geocentrism. our limited recorded history proved creationism. for us, ignorance of the future does the same. unlike all life forms, our memories let us live in yesterday because we don't (yet) see the eons of technological evolution a head of us.

--

how many people could learn your job/lifestyle. no other animals can pick up a new adaption whenever they want...

--

Our sentience is a only a requirement for technological evolution, why else would we need it?

--

Learning who your teacher is. Not knowing Techvolution is like not knowing how your teacher is marking you...

--

- explore historical examples of technological identity shifts. One day Tsar is and then he's not.

--

Maybe comparing the amount of offspring/products a creature requires to sustain itself, is a preliminary way to create a taxonomy of technological creatures?
