### Declaration of the Rights of Man, and the Citizen
Article I – Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be founded only upon the general good.

Article II – The goal of any political association is the conservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man. These rights are liberty, property, safety and resistance against oppression.

Article III – The principle of any sovereignty resides essentially in the Nation. No body, no individual may exercise any authority which does not proceed directly from the nation.

Article IV – Liberty consists of doing anything which does not harm others: thus, the exercise of the natural rights of each man has only those borders which assure other members of the society the fruition of these same rights. These borders can be determined only by the law.

Article V – The law has the right to forbid only actions harmful to society. Anything which is not forbidden by the law cannot be impeded, and no one can be constrained to do what it does not order.

Article VI – The law is the expression of the general will. All the citizens have the right of contributing personally or through their representatives to its formation. It must be the same for all, either that it protects, or that it punishes. All the citizens, being equal in its eyes, are equally admissible to all public dignities, places, and employments, according to their capacity and without distinction other than that of their virtues and of their talents.

Article VII – No man can be accused, arrested nor detained but in the cases determined by the law, and according to the forms which it has prescribed. Those who solicit, dispatch, carry out or cause to be carried out arbitrary orders, must be punished; but any citizen called or seized under the terms of the law must obey at once; he renders himself culpable by resistance.

Article VIII – The law should establish only penalties that are strictly and evidently necessary, and no one can be punished but under a law established and promulgated before the offense and legally applied.

Article IX – Any man being presumed innocent until he is declared culpable if it is judged indispensable to arrest him, any rigor which would not be necessary for the securing of his person must be severely reprimanded by the law.

Article X – No one may be disquieted for his opinions, even religious ones, provided that their manifestation does not trouble the public order established by the law.

Article XI – The free communication of thoughts and of opinions is one of the most precious rights of man: any citizen thus may speak, write, print freely, except to respond to the abuse of this liberty, in the cases determined by the law.

Article XII – The guarantee of the rights of man and of the citizen necessitates a public force: this force is thus instituted for the advantage of all and not for the particular utility of those in whom it is trusted.

Article XIII – For the maintenance of the public force and for the expenditures of administration, a common contribution is indispensable; it must be equally distributed to all the citizens, according to their ability to pay.

Article XIV – Each citizen has the right to ascertain, by himself or through his representatives, the need for a public tax, to consent to it freely, to know the uses to which it is put, and of determining the proportion, basis, collection, and duration.

Article XV – The society has the right of requesting an account from any public agent of its administration.

Article XVI – Any society in which the guarantee of rights is not assured, nor the separation of powers determined, has no Constitution.

Article XVII – Property being an inviolable and sacred right, no one can be deprived of private usage, if it is not when the public necessity, legally noted, evidently requires it, and under the condition of a just and prior indemnity.

### Summary of Third Estate
The Third Estate had around 30,000 complaints and grievances to bring up during the Estates General in 1789. They wanted change but not for the whole French Society and did not expect this meeting of the estates to bring about a full-blown revolution1. The Third Estate refused to consent to the abolition of the sale of offices unless the nobles surrendered some of their privileges. They also spoke out mainly against the financial privileges held by the two other Estates. They were both exempt from most taxes such as the church tithe and the taille (the main direct tax). They also wanted to have a fair voting system in the Estates-General.

The Tennis Court Oath was a dramatic act of defiance by representatives of the nonprivileged classes of the French nation (the Third Estate) during the meeting of the Estates-General (traditional assembly) at the beginning of the French Revolution. The deputies of the Third Estate, realizing that in any attempt at reform they would be outvoted by the two privileged orders, the clergy and the nobility, had formed, on June 17, a National Assembly. Finding themselves locked out of their usual meeting hall at Versailles on June 20 and thinking that the king was forcing them to disband, they moved to a nearby indoor tennis court (salle du jeu de paume). There they took an oath never to separate until a written constitution had been established for France

## Our problems - Rates Up

What do you want from politics? If you want screaming, yelling, blame, and picking a group of people to fight. Go do that.

Politics doesn't exist to fight. It exists so a group of people, from several, to millions, can come together and problems. People only fight when they can't compromise. Before we talk about how to fix our politics, we must understand what our politics is trying to fix.

Here are a list of problem our society is facing today. These aren't Left or Right, but an extensive list of facts to give a picture on politics in America.

The United States has been running consistent trade deficits since 1976 due to high imports of oil and consumer products. In 1974 it was about -2 billion. By 1988 it was -10 billion. By 2000 it was -30 billion and by 2018 it was minus -60 billion. If America was a business, charity, or person, it would be bankrupt.

### Work

In the United States, the ratio of personal income saved has gone down. 1963-1975 it was 10-15% and then lowered under 5% 2009. It increased a little for the next decade, but by 2022 it was again under 5%.

The gap between productivity and a typical worker's compensation has increased dramatically since 1979 Productivity growth and hourly compensation growth, 1948-2022

Productivity-1948-1979 Productivity +117.5%. Compensation +107.3%.. Productivity +64.7% Hourly pay +14.8%. Productivity has grown 4.4x as much as pay. 

Fertility rate: children per woman. 1950 - 2.93.  1970 - 2.47. 2000 - 2.05. 2021 - 1.66. 

Marriages per 1,000 people. Number of marriages in each year per 1,000 people in the population. In 1970 it was 10.60 in USA. Since then the slide has been 6.50.

Stay-at-home parents in Canada.
The number of single-earner families with a stay-at-home parent dropped from 1,487,000 in 1976 to 493,000 in 2015. Families with a stay-at-home mother declined by 1,025,000, whereas those with a stay-at-home father increased by 32,000. The number of stay-at-home mothers declined in almost every year between 1976 and 2015. The majority of the decline occurred between 1976 and 1991 (851,000, compared with 174,000 between 1991 and 2015). 

**People aren't paid well despite being more productive. Not surprinsgly, people aren't having as many kids, aren't getting married as often, and both parents are increasing employed instead of someone concentrating on raising their kids.**

### Health

People have gotten unhealthier. For example, estimated prevalence of obesity which is a risk factor for chronic complications, including cardiovascular disease, and premature death. In 1975 11.70% were obese, by 2016 it was 37.30%

The amount of medical doctors has barely changed in that period. Staying between 2.2 to 2.7 per 1000 people between 1995 to 2020. Meanwhile nurses per 1000 people has gone from 10 in 2000 to 12 in 2020. Hospital Beds went down in the United States. There were 8.5 per 1000 people in 1968 to 4.5 in 1992 to 3 in 2016.

Roughly the same amount of doctors, more nurses, and less hopsital beds. 

USA - 1930 - 0.34% government healthcare expenditure as a share of GDP.
USA - 1960 - 1.09% government healthcare expenditure as a share of GDP.
USA - 1990 - 4.54% government healthcare expenditure as a share of GDP.
USA - 2020 - 15.95% government healthcare expenditure as a share of GDP.

So, if medical care wasn't getting this money, where was it all going?

Growth in the number of healthcare administrators has far outpaced growth in the number of physicians. Between 1975 and 2010, the number of U.S. physicians grew 150%, roughly proportional to population growth, whereas the number of healthcare administrators increased 3200%. Supporters of this exponential growth argue that increased administration is necessary to navigate changes in healthcare delivery, including advances in information technology, new regulatory requirements, and unprecedented levels of scrutiny. On the other hand, critics say administrator growth increases physician burnout. As administrators impose rules, management procedures, and regulations to streamline clinical processes and achieve the "triple aim" of healthcare, the burden often falls on physicians. 

### Prison

The year 2023 marks the 50th year since the U.S. prison population began its unprecedented surge. In 1972, the imprisonment rate was 93 per 100,000 people.11 The prison expansion that commenced in 1973 reached its peak in 2009, achieving a seven-fold increase over the intervening years. Between 1985 and 1995 alone, the total prison population grew an average of eight percent annually. And between 1990 and 1995, all states, with the exception of Maine, substantially increased their prison populations, from 13% in South Carolina to as high as 130% in Texas. The federal system grew 53% larger during this five-year period alone.

### Environment

Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Data. Global carbon emissions from fossil fuels have significantly increased since 1900. Since 1970, CO2 emissions have increased by about 90%, with emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes contributing about 78% of the total greenhouse gas emissions increase from 1970 to 2011. Agriculture, deforestation, and other land-use changes have been the second-largest contributors.

CO2 Emissions in World increased to 34344006.07 KT in 2019 from 34289350.66 KT in 2018. CO2 Emissions in World averaged 21959280.11 KT from 1960 until 2019, reaching an all time high of 34344006.07 KT in 2019 and a record low of 9423934.42 KT in 1961.

Carbon dioxide emissions account for the largest share of greenhouse gases which are associated with climate change and global warming. Data for carbon dioxide emissions include gases from the burning of fossil fuels and cement manufacture, but excludes emissions from land use such as deforestation. Oil releases about 50 percent more carbon dioxide than natural gas, and coal releases about twice as much. Carbon dioxide emissions are often calculated and reported as elemental carbon. The unit of measurement is kt (kiloton).

1968 - 14000000 KT
1980 - 20000000 KT
2004 - 27000000 KT
2016 - 33000000 KT

### Debt

People need money and so do governments. Debt is used by everyone to pay for things today...

National debt of the United States has been growing. In 2006 it was 8 trillion, 2016 18 trillion, and 2024 34 trillion.

Federal debt to revenue ratio The federal government has a 6.75 to 1 debt to revenue ratio as of Q2 2023.
1966 - 2.2
1976 - 2.0
1990 - 2.8
2004 - 3.5
2010 - 5.3
2020 - 6.1

The United States recorded a Government Debt to GDP of 129 percent of the country's Gross Domestic Product in 2022. Government Debt to GDP in the United States averaged 65.20 percent of GDP from 1940 until 2022, reaching an all time high of 129.00 percent of GDP in 2022 and a record low of 31.80 percent of GDP in 1981. source: Office of Management and Budget, The White House

1945 - 119%
1955 - 65%
1972 - 35%
1989 - 55%
2006 - 61%
2023 - 130%

Consumer and Government Debt as a % of GDP

1966 - 80%,
1980 - 75%,
1990 - 110%,
2000 - 105%,
2010 - 180%,
2019 - 175%,

All of these growing problems leads us to the expression of frustration. All governments, whether its an elected one or not, usually promises prosperity. Governments leaders act like parents, people with the authority but also the responsiblity to provide food, shelter, hopes and dreams to their followers.

Hence today's ragged political climate. When the National Election Study began asking about trust in American government in 1958, about three-quarters of Americans trusted the federal government to do the right thing. Trust in government began eroding during the 1960s, recovered in the mid-1980s, but falling again in the mid-1990s. Since 2007, the shares saying they can trust the government always or most of the time has not surpassed 30%.

People don't trust government as much because they feel government is negging on their deal to provide a happy life.

Today's politics will solve all these problems by blaming someone else. Far from being the solution, they point the finger. Hence it is widely reported that partisanship in the United States Congress is at an historic high. We quantify the level of cooperation between Democrat and Republican Party members in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1949-2012. We find that despite short-term fluctuations, partisanship in the U.S. Congress has been increasing exponentially since the 1970s with no sign of abating or reversing.

We want to solve these problems. Our political representatives, parties, ideologies are not solving problems. Before we talk the new ideas that is Techvolution, let's look at how Life solves problems. She's been doing it quite a bit longer.

## How Life Solves Problems

Whatever problems you have, Life has dealt with it before. Hunger, loneliness, thirst, cold, these are all constant problems for anything living on Earth. So while you think of your problems today, a penguin is diving for fish, an ant colony is raiding its neighbor, a polar bear is stalking a seal, and trillions more lifeforms are also battling for survival.

Living in the wild is tough, but many creatures struggle extra hard today. The environment is changing fast. Among other things, forests, greenfields, and ice caps are disappearing. That means lifeforms such as polar bears have increasingly unhelpful adaptations. They have Life's burning desire to survive and procreate, but their form of white coat and colossal bulk is losing its once mighty advantage to kill seals in the Arctic.

What options does the polar bear have?

Let's look at another creature that faced a similar problem. 

Earth is always changing. 2.3 million years ago it was changing especially fast in the space between North and South America. Central American was born after two tectonic plates smashed into each other. At the same time, the Pleistocene glaciation was spreading huge glaciers. Many animals near the polls needed to move. Happily, there was a new land bridge to give everyone a place to aim for a better life.

During this time the dull-colored bird flew out from South America into the Pacific ocean, likely blown out by storms and not showing an explorers spirit. Some birds eventually found salvation in a series of volcanic islands today called Galapagos. Like the polar bears today, these creatures were stuck in a totally new environment.

There are 18 major Galapagos islands. Each are different. Some are new volcanic islands similar to Hawaii. Lush and full of Life. Other islands are old and weathered down by the elements and look almost empty of Life.

But these islands are all the original birds had. So Life went to work.

Life can't assess her environment and available resources and create the traits she needs to survive. Instead, Life slightly changes the genes of new offspring during reproduction. Thus the single bird ventured out into the the many different islands. The birds with the right traits for a particular environment found enough resources to procreate and pass on their beneficial genes. The ones who struggled eventually died off, saving the finch population of its unhelpful traits.

The small birds famously evolved to have different beaks which are suited to different food types such as large seeds, small seeds, berries and insects. With no other birds around, these finches evolved to occupy all different niches in the ecosystem. With Life's evolution at is back, the small bird that landed on a new land, soon became different species, a staple of its many different ecosystems.

When Charles Darwin visted the Galapagos, observing these finches helped him unlock the story of evolution. When Darwin was born people thought God created all Life about 5,000 years ago.

The truth is, we weren't the first species to live on Earth, and we won't be the last. Life has survived billions of years without depending on any species. There's nothing special about any creature. We each survive and thrive according to the same laws of evolution.

Life needs evolution because the Universe is a hostile place. It's constantly changing as mountains fall apart, volcanoes erupt, stars emit radiation, waves wash away shorelines, and endless more things transform our planet. To respond to a changing environment, Life must evolve new species.

Creatures continue playing because their combination of attributes gives them an edge. But, as the planet inevitably changes, traits lose their advantage. Thus, while evolution is a constant race to harvest resources more efficiently, no species ever knows if its list of adaptions is good enough to overcome the problems of its environment. That's why pain hurts so much; it's Life's way of telling individuals to change their behavior and try something else before it's too late.

Evolution has these laws:

 - No species survives forever.
 - All lifeforms have a common ancestry.
 - Evolution of new species is gradual.
 - The number of species always multiplies to fill niches.
 - Natural selection determines which individuals lives on.

These laws describe the patterns and processes of evolution. The competition started after a few amino acids combined to form the first cells 3.6 billion years ago. Since then, evolution has continually created new species. Each is based on the prior one, but each removes or adds traits to find an edge. That edge could mean simple improvements like getting bigger or smaller, faster or slower. Or, the edge could be a specialization to find a niche no one else has, such as polar bears being the only seal hunters seals in a frozen ecosystem.

Regardless of what new adaptation an organism evolves, evolution's selection of the best adaptations requires daily and hourly scrutiny throughout the world of every adaptation, even the slightest. The best way to continually test species is with ecosystems. By putting creatures inside a shared environment, there are checks and balances to keep everyone able to harvest resources from the environment and each other. So when any plant, fungus, scavenger, predator, herbivore, or omnivore falls behind, Life can easily search the ecosystem and create a new species to take the laggard's place. Crucially, all lifeforms cooperate inside ecosystems to keep Life playing the game of survival.

_The Evolutionary Spiral in the [history of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_evolutionary_history_of_life). Evolution is seamless from Life's perspective._

The story of Life is billions of years old, involving trillions of lifeforms. Happily, the pages are very organized. Since Life adapts to its surroundings, we can track evolution using Earth's geological changes. Each period, epoch, and age of Earth's geography, from the Jurassic to the Paleozoic, have different characteristics like concentration of oxygen in the air, amount of water in the oceans, or ice in the poles. These geological changes are chapters in the story of Life.

While Life's evolution was relatively seamless between each chapter, species often had an agonizing time during the transition. Each time Earth's geology changed, it was like a climactic conclusion asking if an individual's list of adaptations would prosper in the new environment. The few creatures who passed the test climbed the ladder to the next age, while most species went around in circles, stubbornly fighting their inevitable extinction; their existence was only remembered as fossils to be maybe uncovered one day. 99% of all the species that have lived are dead.

_The Evolutionary Spiral in the [history of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_evolutionary_history_of_life). From a lifeform perspective, evolution is a series of death circles._

It took scientists centuries to demystify the story of Life's evolution, and this summary misses the many details. But the essence is here: Life must adapt new species to Earth's ever-changing environment. The faster, the better; the more species, the better. Individual evolution suffers no interference because individuals are Life's unit of selection. Wherever there's liquid water, an artist named evolution works night and day, creating custom lifeforms to harvest every possible ray of sunshine, food scrap, and heat source. Evolutions's constant stream of creations is the only reason Earth isn't just another rock revolving around a star with no one to notice how beautiful the Universe is.

Because animals sadly can't change their genes. Like the polar bear now, all must endure the pain of "survival of the fittest" to evolve. We humans also evolved via the same laws of evolution. But once we invented technology, our evolution started to look a little different.

If you don't like politics, or you feel pressured to care because politics is suddenly everywhere, this book is for you. Despite the uproar on American television, radio, and dinner tables, you don't need to pick a side in the Left versus Right war.

You know when a salesman pitches something like an extended warranty. With a lousy product, he resorts to catchy words and false urgency to push for a sale. 

Our ideologues present themselves as being altruistic debaters, but the Right and Left are more like sales departments. They push everything from SUVs, corporate healthcare, and for-profit prisons on the Right. To EVs, government healthcare, and university education on the Left. Each side oversells the good parts, plays down the bad, uses catchphrases like "liberty" and "justice" to appeal to their customers, and creates an urgency that it's "use my products, or else the other side will ruin society."

Our politics is falling apart because the products of both sides are too old, ineffective, or expensive to help Americans live better lives. This book teaches a new kind of politics. One that uses modern technology to fix problems today so our kids, country, and planet have a better tomorrow.

## Inner Flap

_Here is where political philosophy enters. People often don't always reason well, but they do always look for a reason—and political philosophy starts from that fact. In America today, Progressives argue that wealth is unjustly distributed, for example, but they overlook the need to generate wealth. Conservatives do the reverse; preoccupied with wealth generation, they pay little attention to how it should be distributed._

_A partisan difference like this one is not a clash of "values," with each side blind to the other and with no way to decide between them. A competent judge could ask both sides why they omit what they do, and he could supply reasons even if the parties could not. Such a judge is on the way toward a new political philosophy._

Harvey C. Mansfield, _A Student's Guide to Political Philosophy_

---

Whole Foods shoppers want fair-trade coffee. Corvette collectors are ready to buy another model. Home and Garden Television viewers would love to renovate their home again.

Right and Left ideologues want to sell their chosen products. But they don't go out and say that because they have thousands of items in their catalog. The only way to sell each is to use philosophy. Because, like with brands, once a person buys into a philosophy, they will sell themselves the products of its unique way of thinking.

Political philosophy is a long and complicated road, but it's fair to say today that the Right believes in Conservative philosophy started by [Edmund Burke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Burke) in 1806. While, the Left believes in the Progressive philosophy that [John Stuart Mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill) wrote in 1859.

Both philosophies were invented in the early Industrial Age to help our very poor ancestors overcome everyone's extreme poverty. Conservativism empowered industrious people to concentrate the wealth needed to build the first railroads, mills, and factories. They cherished equity, profit, and consistency because these helped their mission to make new products. Progressivism let creative people imagine new products and marketing campaigns to keep industrialization growing. They cared about equality, change, and rights because they knew disadvantaged persons needed to benefit from industrialization to join in. Although they'd bicker, both sides could cooperate because they built and sold the first trains, pants, toilets, pens, disinfectants, and other innovative products.

Happily, after many years of advancements, we no longer have primitive factories, mills, transportation or mass hunger, illiteracy, and disease (if you're thinking about all the poor people in the world today, you are correct; their lives should be improved, but still marvel at the fact in the 1800s, almost all persons lived in poverty and there was no one to blame or send help because poverty-fighting tools didn't exist yet).

Many products and policies today are supported by the Left or Right. For example, government regulation, green energy, and university education are typically Left. At the same time, corporate policies, fossil fuels, and business-world experience are often Right. There are no legal limits on either side's choices, but if a product distributes money, Leftists will likely include it. If a product grows personal wealth, Conservatives will usually like it. Even so, plenty of rich Progressives are selfishly defending their money and charitable Conservatives distributing theirs. Regardless of contradictions, ideologues must protect their friends. While both sides will benefit from a product or policy it argues against, like all sales departments, they only promote the ones in their catalog.

Conservatives and Progressives fight so much today because their Industrial Age products are out of date and losing sales. They mock each other's failings for entertainment because that's the only way to maintain their own believers' loyalty and attract new buyers. Their sales pitches have devolved into "The Right is concentrating too much wealth!" or "The Left is distributing too much wealth!" to which the other side screams to its followers, "That's what we're supposed to be doing! Keep going! Don't them _them_ stop us!"

And both sides are correct.

If we were in the Industrial Age and trying desperately to keep factories from going broke or ending yet another cholera epidemic (both were common). But we're in the Internet Age with advanced robotics, supercomputers, clean energy, 5G internet, 3D printers, smartphones, AI, blockchain, and many more products that easily generate and distribute wealth. Yet, because we're using Conservativism and Progressivism to wield Internet Age tools, our current problem is too much wealth concentration (i.e., thousands of billionaires) and too much wealth distribution (i.e., printing money).

This book introduces Techvolution, a new philosophy combining Progressivism and Conservatism into an updated and improved package. Techvolution generates wealth easily and distributes it fairly by putting the incredible wealth-generating power of Internet Age technology into each person's hands.

Equity and equality all at once.

Conservative and Progressive have difficulty including new technology because it has elements of their enemy inside it. Only a new philosophy rises above their blind hatred so we can remind everyone that feeling hate for past sins and placing blame for our current troubles doesn't change our fate. We are creatures in nature, and as it does for all species, Life demands that we evolve new and improved adaptations to solve our problems.

We either innovate an Internet Age society proactively under the direction of Techvolution's new way of thinking or, after many depressions, wars, and revolutions, gradually teach us the lessons reason wasn't able to.

## Note to the Reader

To teach humanity about our evolution, Techvolution uses Aristotle's _Poetics_ to better understand Hegelian dialectics to showcase how humanity continues Life's Darwinian evolution via technological innovation. That's a mouthful, so it's easier to say this new philosophy explains why the politics inside our families, workplace, governments, and societies are best understood as another story in Life's long and ongoing evolution.

I wrote a deep dive in a book called _Story Cut Tools_, which is a good read but also long. This summary has enough meat so you can skip the nerdy philosophical details and jump into a new philosophy. It will put the power of evolution in your hands so you can evolve a new society today.

## Evolution

As you read this, a penguin is diving for fish, an ant colony is raiding its neighbor, a polar bear is stalking a seal, and trillions more lifeforms are battling for survival.

Living in the wild is tough, but many creatures struggle extra hard today. The environment is changing fast. Among other things, forests, greenfields, and ice caps are disappearing. That means lifeforms such as polar bears have increasingly unhelpful adaptations. They have Life's burning desire to survive and procreate, but their form of white coat and colossal bulk is losing its once mighty advantage to kill seals in the Arctic.

What would you tell a polar bear if you could communicate with her?

Wouldn't it be nice to explain Life on Earth is a game of survival, where organisms must adapt to changing environments to survive. Traits are the expressions of genes, which are passed on from parents to offspring during reproduction. Natural selection is the process by which organisms with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their winning traits to their offspring. Over time, natural selection leads to the evolution of new species that are better adapted to their environment.

Life needs evolution to survive a changing environment.

If we could educate a struggling polar bear about evolution, she would know her endangered place in the story of Life. She could then assess what innovations she needs to prosper in the Artic's new environment. Perhaps male polar bears should help raise their cubs. Or polar bears should hunt in packs to kill reindeer. Maybe the apex predator should go south and diversify her diet with berries, grubs, and roots.

Whatever new traits hungry polar bears will eventually need to have, if they knew about evolution, they could roll their own dice to find the adaptations that'll regain their prosperity. At least by understanding how evolution works, polar bears wouldn't feel so frustrated as they walk in circles, struggling to find seals in a wetter environment.

We can predict a rough future of polar bears because paleontologists, biologists, genealogists, and other specialists have mapped millions of species' habits, linages, and physiologies. This extensive knowledge lets scientists inform humanity about the history, status, and future of many creatures.

Here's a question: Do we know our fate like we know the polar bears? Given how much anger, angst, and confusion we have in our politics, the answer is no.

This book will teach you about human evolution. Our story is the same as all lifeforms. The environment is constantly changing. Thus, Life demands we innovate new adaptations to harvest the resources we need to keep procreating and evolving.

Humans think we understand Life's requirement to evolve. Almost every leader, company, and ideology says they'll provide enough resources for their people to live a happy Life. But all the marches, protests, strikes, fears of job losses, and other outbursts of frustration from society today show we don't know how to drop old ways of living and adopt the new adaptations we need to prosper. Indeed, most of today's Conservative vs. Progressive politics is about resisting evolution to keep an aging way of Life alive and then telling stories to justify why "the other" should bear the burden of society's refusal to stop being Industrial Age polar bears and start anew.

Techvolution will teach you how to move on from the past. You'll roll your own dice in the game of evolution and adopt the technological innovations that'll put the power of wealth-generating modern technology into your, and everyone else's, hands.

Because animals sadly can't change their genes. They must endure the pain of "survival of the fittest" to evolve. We can change our fate by updating our characteristics with modern technology. But before we use modern technology to regain our prosperity, we must use evolution to create a new politics. The recipe is straightforward: take one part Left and one part Right and mix them together.

<!-- ![Preface](/assets/problem-solving-philosophy.png) -->
<!-- Left and Right ideologies loves to "debate". But never do they concede a loss because they don't embrace evolution. In contrast try and find an innovative animal that spends time arguing with complacent ones. -->

## New Politics

>I thought you guys would like to hear this story. I know my fellow wrestlers know exactly what I'm talking about. A martial art is either real or it's not. Very early on in the sport of mixed-martial arts, when the logical assumption from the marketing team is that you're going to get every taekwondo student, every karate student, every judo practitioner, and every aikido and they're just going to absolutely love mixed-martial arts.

>It ended up being the absolute opposite.

>All of those arts that I just named that, turned out to not be real, or at least real in terms of their effectiveness in actual combat, steered as far away from mixed-martial arts as they could. They begged their students not to watch. Found a number of different reasons why mixed-martial arts is too violent or too, whatever their excuse was.

>Because the practioners of old martial arts didn't like what they were finding out. They had bought into it. They had spent their Life. They had mastered some of these old martial arts movements. To only find out that it was a waste of time.

In its highest form, politics discusses what direction a society should take. Individuals give their opinions, offer their perspectives, and exchange ideas. Should society invest in a new dock or a new road? Should we go to war or make peace? Should we attract newcomers or invest in citizens? Good politics is like a healthy nervous system directing resources to solve the pains of its society.

But daily politics isn't always so rational.

Cells in the human body are constantly fighting for resources, and we, the people who make up the ["body politic"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_politic) of our respective countries, are no different. Even in good times, daily politics is full of ranting, half-truths, and memes because individuals want tax breaks, subsidies, government bailouts, and other resources.

Why would anyone want to be left out?

Political philosophy is supposed to rise above daily politics and create a shared vision for a society. This super-narrative allows people to compete for resources while still trending everyone towards innovation. Only when a body politic works together can its members build a healthy nervous system that heals enough pains to keep evolution going. A good philosophy makes people realize humans are not the final judge of right or wrong. As it is for all creatures, Mother Nature ultimately decides if our way of Life is harvesting resources well enough to keep our civilization playing the game of evolution.

So, while many ignorant polar bears are doomed to suffer for many more years, with a good philosophy, humans can be happy and healthy in a constantly evolving society. As happened when young Conservatism and Progressivism together lifted humanity from poverty.

To evolve, we humans develop new traits. We try to change our "genes," so to speak. We train techniques to enhance our bodies. We change government policies to direct our resources in better ways. We open businesses to utilize goods and services differently. We invent tools to solve our problems with lasting solutions. And we learn new ideas to expand our minds.

Whatever traits we develop, we do it to solve our pains. 

Martial arts is a great example.

Karate, kickboxing, taekwondo, sambo, wrestling, aikido, jiu-jitsu, judo, and boxing are our most popular martial arts. Each teaches unique self-defense techniques like wrist locks or body punches. Each martial art creates rules that say only their techniques are allowed; there's no kicking in a boxing match, for example.

The world's martial arts co-existed for many years. Inside the disciplines, teachers happily taught their techniques to the next generation, practitioners would train almost every day, and the best students would compete in tournaments, get scholarships, and strive to become world champions. A discipline's rules, history, and ethics created a unique fighting philosophy that was kept lively by everyone congregating around experts, debates, and the latest news.

But these martial artists would only compete against each other.

However, in the late 1980s, as cable television and videotapes spread information worldwide, once-isolated fighting cultures started to open up. People got curious. As fighters began to watch other disciplines, they asked themselves, "Which martial art is best?"

Would a boxer beat a kickboxer? What about a wrestler versus a karate guy? Many people wanted to know what if martial artists threw away their rule books and fought a real fight.

In the early 1990s, the questions stopped, and the fighting started. At first, called Vale Tudo, then Ultimate Fighting, martial artists from every discipline competed in fights that excluded no techniques. Finally, the world's fighting masters could prove their martial art was the best on Earth!

And the winner of the best martial art was...

All of them are.

And none of them.

This revelation surprised everyone. The martial arts community assumed one discipline would reign supreme. But no discipline did because each had a limited toolbox of techniques. Sometimes, those techniques were very effective in a real fight, like Brazilian jiu-jitsu's submissions or wrestling's dominant control. But many techniques like karate's katas, taekwondo's flashy high kicks, and boxing's obsession with standing toe-to-toe and swinging for a knockout were easily countered and [therefore ineffective](https://youtube.com/shorts/4IjqBuo3Bow?feature=share).

As Ultimate Fighting tournaments continued, it became clear that some martial arts disciplines were more effective than others, but each had drawbacks, and none was complete. When Ultimate Fighting grew in popularity during the 1990s and 2000s, it forced all martial arts communities to reflect on their fighting techniques, styles, and philosophy.

As the opening quote says, many practitioners, coaches, and pundits (especially from the least effective disciplines) retreated into their sub-cultures because they "didn't like what they were finding out." I.e., they had bills to pay, and suddenly everyone could see their product was a self-defense philosophy with many useless techniques bundled inside.

Stubborn martial artists masked their problems by forming echo chambers. They pretended nothing had changed as their members told prospects and members about their glorious history, impressive morality, and superior fighting philosophy. It was all salesmanship to protect themselves from simple discussions about their technique's effectiveness against other options.

However, many fighters embraced the effectual truth revealed by Ultimate Fighting. As a result, the world of martial arts started to get all mixed up.

Kickboxers trained submissions. Wrestlers learned some punching. Masters in one discipline started as eager newbies in another. Like a bumblebee going from flower to flower, pioneering fighters like Bas Rutten, Maurice Smith, and Ken Shamrock cross-pollinated techniques from everywhere. They evolved more complete skill sets than any martial arts or discipline teacher.

These new martial artists discarded loyalty to a single discipline by opening their minds. They adopted evolution's philosophy of "adapt or die." Old disciplines, school-like systems of grades, belts, trophies, medals, and scholarships became stepping stones to building a complete skillset and not end goals to be relished. A fighter's physical pain was the new barometer of whether a technique or teacher was good or bad.

Finally, human self-defense learned what every lifeform on Earth knows: loyalty to man-made philosophies will not save you in Nature.

No deer in the world depends on a judge to save it when fleeing a bear, as no bear depends on a pundit declaring it the winner to get its next meal. Just like in Nature, the best martial art technique is entirely dependent on one's opponent and surroundings while measuring the risks and rewards of the fight.

Fighters weren't stupid despite being misled by judges, pundits, and teachers of ineffective martial arts. Their fault was quite human; they fell prey to good storytelling. 

Quality storytelling is why so many devoted boxers, judokas, and other practitioners were sucked in by their respective fighting disciplines. Filled with history, culture, and traditions, isolated martial arts each had a philosophy so complete that it sold people into thinking it was the single source of truth.

During the growth of Ultimate Fighting, most fighters quickly realized the rules of boxing, kickboxing, wrestling, etc., let practitioners hone their chosen techniques. But the rules were artificial and must be forgotten when training for real fights.

After fighters embraced all disciplines, they entered a brave new world.

A world of remarkable progress, collaboration, and democratization. With an open mind, video cameras, and the internet, fighters created a wealth of training videos and distributed them worldwide. With accessible education, fighters unbundle martial arts disciplines into their individual techniques and create a blossoming ecosystem. Each fighter ventured out to improve themselves every day. Kickboxers learned some wrestlers, Jiu-jitsu black belts learned low-kicks. Each martial art became a sub-discipline that brought its techniques to an open marketplace of ideas.

The martial arts community was put on notice that echo chambers are for losers.

With evolution as their teacher, these new martial artists found the best mixture of techniques, trainers, and disciplines. The speed of victories and the less pain suffered in winning them was the best judge, teacher, and pundit of martial arts techniques. The top trainers helped fighters adapt better techniques faster.

When fighters finally embraced evolution, they created a new way for humans to think of self-defense called mixed-martial arts.

In mixed-martial arts, everyone, from fighters to trainers, pundits to fans, veterans to newbies, is accountable to evolution. Thus, fighters don't limit themselves within the confines of a single discipline. Every martial art has something to offer, so every person should be a bumblebee going from flower to flower, learning from each discipline. The best technique is the one that brings results. Evolution is so admired by mixed-martial artists that everybody is supposed to give their opinions, offer their perspectives, and exchange ideas because "iron sharpens iron."

Mixing the human body's adaptability with a free mind created a new, self-correcting, sustainable martial art. Today, a skilled mixed-martial artist is an overwhelming favorite against a champion of any fighting discipline. Just as important, since mixed-martial arts includes all techniques, any person, whether short or tall, heavy or thin, aggressive or meek, can "mix-and-match" techniques to find their niche and learn to win a fight. 

And finding a niche is what evolution is all about. By empowering anyone and everyone, mixed-martial arts is the ultimate fighting philosophy.

---

On our journey to improve our politics, here are the lessons we should take from the story of mixed-martial arts.

Today, in the early 21st century, the middle class suffers systemic problems. Taxes get more confusing. School prepares students less for the job market. Insurance gets more expensive. And there are many more pains in our society trending poorly.

Looking at our rising bills and shrinking savings accounts, we feel beat up. And, so, we look around for help.

Many people sell ideological politics on television, social media, and backyard barbeques. They get our attention because ideologues insist their techniques and tools improve the economy. As the economy gets more uncertain, the more sales these ideologues close. As a result, many people think being "political" requires supporting a single ideology of "red," "blue," "green," and so on. These new ideological converts buy books, follow pundits, go to rallies, and have a "good" or "bad" label for every tool and technique like solar panels, electric vehicles, government welfare programs, and...

Regular people keep getting our asses kicked in our real lives.

Because we think politics means supporting _one_ ideology and wrongfully think our government, paychecks, and happiness are governed by its rulebook.

Today's ideological teachers, pundits, and commentators are not philosophers pondering how best to relieve the pains of our entire body politic. They are salesman pushing their bundled techniques and tools before knowing what fight we're each in.

<!-- ![Ant Death Spiral](/assets/problem-solving-philosophy.png) -->
_Ant Death Spiral. Image Needed._

Thus, our ideologues are in a sort of death spiral. Whether "red," "blue," "orange," or "green," they are going in circles trying to make their Industrial Age techniques improve the economy single-handedly. They keep failing for the same reason no single martial art discipline can be the single source of truth. Problems don't adapt to solutions. As the polar bears are finding out, lifeforms must evolve to overcome problems.

As of now, we listen to ideological salesman contort our worldview with simple observations that justify their sales pitch. If people quit their jobs en masse, they _all_ must be lazy, assumes Conservative commentators on cable news. Or if lots of people rob stores, they _all_ must be hungry, say Progressive bloggers on social media. As bad managers lose workers, criminals run amok, and other symptoms get worse, ideological commentators, pundits, and supporters retreat into their echo chambers because "they don't like what they're finding out."

That's why I wrote _Techvolution_. It helps break any steadfast loyalty to one ideology and encourages everyone to realize we're a lifeforms in Nature. We should only be loyal to the rules, techniques, and tools that solve real-life problems. Because Nature is a street fight for polar bears, martial artists, and you.

If we could teach evolution to polar bears, they'd start adapting to their new environment. When fighters did embrace evolution, they improved their powers very quickly. When we welcome evolution in our politics, our body politic will have the freedom of mind to mix-and-match tools and techniques to overcome any economic problem. Be it dreadfully unproductive jobs, worsening climate change, or debilitating government bureaucracy. And when someone is confronting failure they will be empowered to evolve instead of making excuses.

You could describe Techvolution as mixed-ideological politics.

Like all the amazing martial arts techniques that only came together because of mixed-martial arts, it'll take mixed-ideological politics to shift through all the options of AI, apps, green energy, and so on down the Internet Age list of creations to solve the problems inflaming our politics with blame instead of problem-solving.

First though we must escaping the death spiral of today's ideological echo chambers. If we don't we'll easily get swept into the Left and Right war. It won't be easy. The constant storytelling of Twitter feeds, cable news, and dinner table arguments is engrossing. To see through ideological salesmanship requires a solid understanding of storytelling. Once you get that, you'll avoid being sucked into the false security of ideological echo chambers.

Once you're protected from political storytelling, you'll have the freedom of mind to use any Internet Age tool and technique. After you've found your niche, you'll be as powerful in your politics as a mixed-martial artist is in a street fight.

<!-- ![Bills Bills Bills]() -->
_As a member of the body politic, your pain determines what techniques and tools are good or bad. Holding back another's evolution is never good because "iron sharpens iron."_

## We Need Chambers, Just Not Echo Chambers

Before we learn to protect ourselves from today's Industrial Age ideological echo chambers, it's important to remember that we're not erasing ideologies. We're only becoming like mixed-martial artists, so we can mix-and-match policies, techniques, and tools to solve our everyday pains.

That means we must not judge tools by their ideological cover. Gas SUVs are sometimes needed, but sometimes EVs are too. Occasionally, we do need to raise taxes. But sometimes we need to cut them. GMO food can be harmful, but there are pluses, too. What tool or technique we choose depends on the pain, risks, and rewards of using a particular solution.

Some may doubt that our society can follow martial arts and embrace mixed-ideological politics. We can. Here's another field with a similarly enlightened mix-and-match philosophy.

Modern medicine has many disciplines and specialists. Some are based on cutting-edge research, others on old-school remedies. In the past, when isolated by geography and culture, patients were bound to do what the local healer or doctor prescribed. But today, you would never go to one medical professional, expecting them to be a master of every health problem.

There are too many illnesses and injuries for any medical discipline to master them all.

That's why all medical professionals today, from homeopathic healers to neural surgeons, are recognized as sub-disciplines. Each has its own tools and techniques, rulebooks, and culture. Still, medical professionals from each field can say their strengths and weaknesses and admit they are a niche rather than the single source of truth. The patient is like a bumblebee searching for better solutions, and the philosophy of modern healthcare is mixing disciplines to solve their pain as quickly as possible. While modern medicine certainly isn't perfect (especially its administration), it's nearly magical compared to when surgeons didn't sanitize their scalpels and doctors used one-size-fits-all solutions like leeches.

Most importantly, we understand medical professionals can be corrupt. If a doctor over-prescribes medication or sells "snake oil," we know the doctor isn't following evidence-based medicine and, therefore, has illegitimate authority to diagnose and solve problems.

Modern medicine and mixed-martial arts thus embrace evolution. Both medical and mixed-martial arts recognize that it is best to select from an ecosystem of options and that solving a fighter's or patient's pain is the only sign of success. Other human endeavors are also enlightened enough to embrace real-world results as superior to a teacher or boss's authority. [Baseball, for example, did it with Moneyball fame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MjxoaynCmk).

So, if a person can train techniques from multiple martial arts disciplines. And doctors can refer their patients to specialists from other disciplines. Why can't our politics also be self-aware and mix-and-match different policies, tools, and techniques according to their strengths and weaknesses in solving your unique economic problems?

<!-- ![Picture of a cell]() -->
<!-- _The autonomic nervous system heals our bodies. We only know something is wrong when we feel pain._ -->

To enlighten our politics in such a way, we only have to accept no ideology is complete. Like in medicine or Ultimate Fighting, any technique or tool must _not_ be evaluated on its ideological purity but based on evidence of its real-world results in reducing hunger, thirst, cold, depression, anxiety, and the other pains Life gives us so we change our ways before its too late.

Ideologues from everywhere on the political spectrum will (eventually) learn they don't need to take themselves so seriously, burden themselves so much, or sell their services so aggressively. Like a boxing coach or speech pathologist, each can improve their chosen techniques and tools and let people come to them as needed.

But for now, the biggest obstacle to mixed-ideological politics is the same as it was for mixed-martial arts. Ideological pundits, teachers, and commentators don't realize the value of a mix-and-match philosophy, so they tell great stories about why their beliefs, techniques, and rulebooks are the single source of truth inside echo chambers. To use mixed-ideological politics to find the niche of Internet Age tools you need to live a better Life, we must escape the spell of ideological echo chambers by understanding why we buy into great stories so easily.

_We monitor Industrial Age industrialization statistics like housing starts, car purchases, and college enrollment. We don't yet monitor daily pains such as mortgages not yet paid off, parents going to food banks, avoidable car crashes, and similar symptoms of a sick body politic.

## Cinderella

The classic fairytale _Cinderella_ knows how to hook an audience.

The movie tells the story of a pretty, diligent, and kind-hearted country girl named Cinderella. An unloved orphan, she lives with her wicked stepmother and two spoiled stepsisters. Jealous of her beauty, Cinderella's step-family antagonizes her ambitions, belittles her abilities, and forces her to do all the house chores. With only the local animals for companionship, the lonely teenager dreams of a better life and a chance to find happiness.

One day, Cinderella discovers the King is hosting an extravagant ball to find a bride for his charming son. Filled with excitement, Cinderella's friends help her sew a dress for what's sure to be the most wonderful night of her life.

But, just before departing for the party, her evil family forbids her, mocks her uppitiness, tears her dress to shreds, and leaves the young orphan home alone in tears.

Thankfully, just as despair is about to set in, Cinderella's Fairy Godmother appears. With a flick of her wand, the godmother transforms Cinderella's ragged clothes into a dazzling gown and sparkling glass slippers. The godmother also creates a carriage and a team of horses so her mistreated goddaughter will go to the ball in royal style.

At the party, Cinderella captivates everyone, especially the prince, with her beauty and grace. The two glide across the floor and whisper sweet nothings in each other's ears. Sadly, the spell that gave Cinderella her dress and entourage ends. The shy orphan flees the ballroom, leaving the prince only a glass slipper to remember her by.

The heartbroken young man is determined to find his true love and orders his men to search the kingdom for the girl who fits the glass slipper.

They eventually get to Cinderella's house. The wicked stepmother has gotten wise that her stepdaughter is the prince's heartthrob and locks her stepdaughter in the attic. Cinderella's friends come to the rescue, steal the key, and open the attic door. Cinderella can now ask the prince's men if she can try on the glass slipper. Just as she's about to, the evil stepmother smashes the precious memento.

To which Cinderella responds by revealing she has the other slipper.

And the rest is history.

The movie _Cinderella_ was very popular when it was released. It's popular today. And it'll be popular hundreds of years from now when humanity is (hopefully) traveling the stars. People will always like the story because everyone can cheer for a warm-hearted person overcoming bullies to improve her life.

People love stories. We can't get enough of them. A good story lets us experience the trials of another person. From horrible tragedies to whimsical romances, stories teach us the lessons of many lives.

Stories pass on so much information because they create a new reality. The creation process starts with the props that fill the storyworld with cups, clothes, homes, and the other items we expect to see in the environment. Next, there is music that relays the characters' emotions during critical events. Next comes the dialogue, which communicates what each character wants in an easy-to-understand way. Next, there is the villain who likes the world the way it is and defends it against change. After that comes the philosophy of the storyworld that dictates the rules everyone in the story is supposed to live by; for example, Cinderella is supposed to obey her stepmother. Cinderella is the story's hero because she disregards the ruling philosophy by fighting for a better Life. At the top of this story pyramid are tools, a catchall term for the objects, from glass slippers to Death Stars, that are above regular props because they are the levers of power that control what happens in the story.

Storytellers work hard to mix these ingredients together. When done correctly, the resulting "cake" will transfix audiences and raise strong emotions and lasting commitments because we've experienced the Life of another person inside an easy-to-digest package.

---

And that brings us back to avoiding echo chambers and practicing mixed-ideological politics.

Dismantling echo chambers starts by realizing _Cinderella_ isn't about a girl abused by her evil step-family. The fairytale is not about a girl overcoming her evil step-family to marry her prince charming.

The story of _Cinderella_ is about a girl overcoming her antagonistic step-family using levers of power, i.e., tools.

If Cinderella doesn't get the horses, carriage, and evening dress from her Fairy Godmother, she'll never get into the ball. The prince would only find her if he found her lost slipper. If the imprisoned girl's allies didn't steal the key to the attic, she'd never get out in time. And if Cinderella didn't have the second glass slipper, her name would be famous as a tragedy instead of a fairytale.

Cinderella had a problem. It wasn't that her step-family were tyrants or that the rules of society were unjust. Cinderella's problem was that her terrible step-family controlled the tools Cinderella needed to improve her Life.

From _Star Wars_, to _The Matrix_, to _Cinderella_ all stories start with a group of people controlling the tools while creating a ruling philosophy to explain their control. The hero encounters a problem and reaches for a tool to solve it. Antagonists reveal themselves by preventing access to defend their power base. The drama is about heroes and villains battling to control the tools required to change the world. The winner changes or reaffirms the world in their image.

Notice the ruling philosophy is two-sided: actual and public. When the stepmother rips Cinderella's gown, locks her in the attic, and destroys the slipper, she's using tools to alter the world to her benefit and letting us see her actual philosophy of oppression in her heart.

Yet, the stepmother would not admit her abuse. She'd tell the public, and likely herself, that Cinderella is loved and cared for. If asked why her stepdaughter is working so hard or absent from the ball, the stepmother would tell a story to justify her actions.

The truth is the stepmother favored her daughters and thus didn't want Cinderella to compete with them. Like old martial arts teachers, she couldn't admit that, so she said one thing while doing another. Cinderella wore a mask of oppression when she listened, complained, and argued about her stepmother's commands. Only when Cinderella decided to control the tools that controlled her fate did she better herself.

![Masked and antagonsit](/assets/problem-solving-philosophy.png)
_Masks of oppression often become the face we wear._

If a doctor insists on an ineffective treatment or a martial arts coach advises a bad technique, they are corrupt. The stepmother was crooked for the same reason. Authority is only valid when it empowers its follower's traits. Why would Life give authority that harmed its own evolution?

That's why, like all heroes, Cinderella's dreams only come true when she grabs the tools that solve her pains.

Another lesson from stories is that the hero and villain are no longer the main characters once the story ends. We don't need to hear from Cinderella after she marries the prince because "they lived happily ever after." As for the stepmother, she has no more tools to attack Cinderella and is thus no longer a threat worthy of attention.

Tools being levers of power, how we use our tools being our actual philosophy, and main characters having a limited shelf-life, are the facts those who sell themselves, their ideology, and their tools as being the eternal single source of truth that will solve all your problems, don't like.

## Conclusions Bring Mixed-Ideological Politics

Despite the emotions over gender pronouns, what name to call Christmas, and other culture war content, today's fiery politics is about resources. Because, at the end of the day, people are not ideologies. They are biological beings that need food, water, and shelter and, therefore, have bills to pay, and thus need someone to buy the techniques and tools they know how to use.

As the Industrial Age tools and techniques get older and less useful, each ideologue is forced to protect themselves from competition inside echo chambers. So, there are increasingly bullshit public philosophies in our politics. For example, Conservatives' inclusion of oil-based tools means they must deny climate change could possibly be man-made. Progressives' incorporation of massive government welfare programs means they must deny when these programs waste boatloads of money. Despite each side's sales pitches filled with phrases like social justice and personal liberty, each side only wants to close a sale on their tools.

The giveaway is the lack of conclusions.

Echo chambers don't like conclusions because they force reflection on whether a tool changed the world or not. For example, if a fighter gets choked unconscious in a mixed-martial arts fight, he must reflect on his tactics like Cinderella did after her dress was torn to shreds.

When curious fighters said, "What discipline is best?" and engaged in real fights and listened to their pains, they finally realized no discipline can be the single source of truth.

Belief in a mix-and-match philosophy turns people into heroes. Because tools shouldn't be clumped together into good or evil. They are inanimate. Like the glass slippers, they only hold value if they can help solve a problem. And that's what makes a hero, someone setting out to solve _their_ unique pains.

To escape echo chambers, embrace Techvolution and its mixed-ideological politics. Only then will you find your niche. All you need to do is understand when a mixed-martial artist enters a boxing gym, he's not being disloyal to his wrestling coach. When a family doctor refers you to a physiotherapist, she's not being unfaithful to medical doctors. When a biologist says, "I don't know, ask a neuroscientist," she's not being a bad biologist. This is because these fields understand they are sub-disciplines that exist to help a person solve a problem.

Fighters overcome opponents. Patients battle diseases. Cinderella had an evil stepfamily.

What's your problem?

- Is your job not paying enough? You will not be a disloyal Conservative because you joined a union.
- Are welfare programs administrators wasting bundles of money? You will not be a disloyal Progressive for exposing them.
- Is a lousy supply chain increasing your costs? You will not be a disloyal Progressive or Conservative for wanting a robust local supply chain.

You will not be disloyal because you are not Conservative or Progressive. You're a lifeform looking for resources; it's not your job to judge good and bad techniques and tools based on ideology. It's your job to solve your daily pains. And if any stepmother insults, bullies, threatens, or attacks your choice, let them innovate a better one.

You should use mixed-ideological politics to choose any tool. Not only because evolution has proven so successful in modern medicine and mixed-martial arts but also because selecting the best adaptation is the only way to win the never-ending game of evolution.

## There is No Lion King

We weren't the first species to live on Earth, and we won't be the last. Life has survived billions of years without depending on any species. There's nothing special about any creature. We each survive and thrive according to the same laws of evolution.

Life needs evolution because the Universe is a hostile place. It's constantly changing as mountains fall apart, volcanoes erupt, stars emit radiation, waves wash away shorelines, and endless more things transform our planet. To respond to a changing environment, Life must evolve new species.

Creatures continue playing because their combination of attributes gives them an edge. But, as the planet inevitably changes, traits lose their advantage. Thus, while evolution is a constant race to harvest resources more efficiently, no species ever knows if its list of adaptions is good enough to overcome the problems of its environment. That's why pain hurts so much; it's Life's way of telling individuals to change their behavior and try something else before it's too late.

Evolution has these laws:

 - No species survives forever.
 - All lifeforms have a common ancestry.
 - Evolution of new species is gradual.
 - The number of species always multiplies to fill niches.
 - Natural selection determines which individuals lives on.

These laws describe the patterns and processes of evolution. The competition started after a few amino acids combined to form the first cells 3.6 billion years ago. Since then, evolution has continually created new species. Each is based on the prior one, but each removes or adds traits to find an edge. That edge could mean simple improvements like getting bigger or smaller, faster or slower. Or, the edge could be a specialization to find a niche no one else has, such as polar bears being the only seal hunters seals in a frozen ecosystem.

Regardless of what new adaptation an organism evolves, evolution's selection of the best adaptations requires daily and hourly scrutiny throughout the world of every adaptation, even the slightest. The best way to continually test species is with ecosystems. By putting creatures inside a shared environment, there are checks and balances to keep everyone able to harvest resources from the environment and each other. So when any plant, fungus, scavenger, predator, herbivore, or omnivore falls behind, Life can easily search the ecosystem and create a new species to take the laggard's place. Crucially, all lifeforms cooperate inside ecosystems to keep Life playing the game of survival.

![Elephant Speciation](/assets/speciation-elephants.png)
_Here's one example of how a species evolves._

The story of Life is billions of years old, involving trillions of lifeforms. Happily, the pages are very organized. Since Life adapts to its surroundings, we can track evolution using Earth's geological changes. Each period, epoch, and age of Earth's geography, from the Jurassic to the Paleozoic, have different characteristics like concentration of oxygen in the air, amount of water in the oceans, or ice in the poles. These geological changes are chapters in the story of Life.

While Life's evolution was relatively seamless between each chapter, species often had an agonizing time during the transition. Each time Earth's geology changed, it was like a climactic conclusion asking if an individual's list of adaptations would prosper in the new environment. The few creatures who passed the test climbed the ladder to the next age, while most species went around in circles, stubbornly fighting their inevitable extinction; their existence was only remembered as fossils to be maybe uncovered one day. 99% of all the species that have lived are dead.

![Evolutionary Spiral](/assets/speciation-elephants.png)
_The Evolutionary Spiral in the [history of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_evolutionary_history_of_life). Evolution is seamless from Life's perspective. But there are often tragic endings for lifeforms who walk around in death circles._

It took scientists centuries to demystify the story of Life's evolution, and this summary misses the many details. But the essence is here: Life must adapt new species to Earth's ever-changing environment. The faster, the better; the more species, the better. Individual evolution suffers no interference because individuals are Life's unit of selection. Wherever there's liquid water, an artist named evolution works night and day, creating custom lifeforms to harvest every possible ray of sunshine, food scrap, and heat source. Evolutions's constant stream of creations is the only reason Earth isn't just another rock revolving around a star with no one to notice how beautiful the Universe is.

And now, we understand why echo chambers are doomed. They presume an adaptation can be ever-lasting. They commit themselves to a few techniques and tools on the Tree of Life and antagonize the creation of new ones by telling stories of their adaptation's supposed perfection. They try to remove the individual as the unit of selection by telling stores why Cinderella should stay in the attic.

Life, of course, doesn't care what stories we tell ourselves. Leaving those inside echo chambers to reconcile the ideology they passionately believe in against the pain they feel walking in circles, finding someone to blame because their aging adaptations can't harvest enough resources to make their users happy and healthy.

As it's always been, evolution is our way out. Unfettered innovation explains why modern medicine, mixed-martial arts, and fairytale characters like Cinderella are so successful. They drop unhelpful tools and pick up useful ones as needed. Their freedom of mind lets them reflect on their progress and make changes before it's too late.

For us to master evolution and use its incredible power, there is one crucial difference to always remember. Humans do not evolve. Technology does.

<!--  -->
_Today's politics is so angry because we don't have the philosophy to tell us to drop the old and pick up the new. We are all polar bears._

## Human Biology is Out, Technology is In

The Boston Symphony had a problem. No one knew why their orchestra had so many men. Plenty of talented female musicians challenged males for orchestra seats, yet women weren't making the cut. The auditions were already blind, so the symphony tried another technique to fix their problem. They asked musicians to take off their shoes before auditioning.

Voilà! The orchestra had even girls and guys once the shoes stopped giving away the musician's identity. Evolution gave a standing ovation because anything that gets in the way of the best solution, like gender, is all noise.

Finding the perfect biological adaptation takes a long time. Since organic lifeforms are physically attached to their adaptations, genetic mutations take millions of years to create new species. But while biological evolution is slow, at least it's inevitable. Genetic mutations happen involuntarily during procreation, so biological innovation is automatic with no interference possible.

There are no stepmothers in the biological evolution of Life.

We humans can't evolve biologically. If we did, then there might be a difference between male and female musicians. But our genes don't change when learning an adaptation like a violin or piano. Instead, we adapt our psychology to incorporate a new tool into our list of traits.

Most anyone with enough patience can learn any tool and evolve their skillset.

We are still biological lifeforms, but because we invent new tools, we facilitate Life's evolution with technology instead of biology. There is effectively no difference. Life wants adaptations that consistently collect energy, adapt, and procreate. Life doesn't care about the material composition any more than a composer or audience cares about what gender the orchestra is.

Our technological evolution follows the same laws as regular evolution.

 - No technology survives forever.
 - All technology has a common ancestry.
 - Evolution of new tools is gradual.
 - The number of tools continually diversifies to fill niches.
 - Natural selection determines which individual tools/users live on.
 
Thus, we humans are biological vessels for technological evolution. As Cinderella demonstrated, our fate is determined by the tools in our hands, not the genes in our cells.

Our evolution requires innovators to undertake the burden of inventing tools that effectively become a new species once someone uses them. Teaching a new tool requires lots of information, which is best communicated with a story. Therefore, innovation requires storytelling inside marketing and ideology to connect person and tool.

This happened during the creation of judo, boxing, wrestling, and other martial arts. While these disciplines have little technology, they still use bags, pads, ropes, gloves, weights, books, and videos to train, learn, and pass on knowledge.

These martial arts used the human body as a foundation to attach various techniques and tools. These distinct traits created species like boxers, judokas, kickboxers, etc.

![Technological Tree of Life](/assets/speciation-elephants.png)
_We live on the technological tree of Life. We live on the same evolutionary tree as biology but only operate technology._

Once home televisions and the internet allowed lots of information to flow, it became possible to do what evolution does: review the species, evaluate their strengths and weaknesses, and pick the best ones to solve a problem.

But, while the natural selection of biological Life is automatic, it is not for technological Life. For fighters to mix-and-match the best martial arts techniques required seeing through the stories that connected them to a single self-defense discipline. And seeing through stories isn't our best feature.

Why?

Because seeing through a story that connects us to a tool, we're doing what Cinderella did and confronting a power structure that typically responds with a self-serving, anti-evolution story.

_"Cinderella, the ball isn't for you."_
_"Cinderella, clean up; that is your job because you're the stepdaughter."_
_"Cinderella, you can't try on the glass slipper because I'm the mother, and I say only my daughters can be a princess."_
_"Cinderella, your pain is invalid; do what you're told to do."_

We can't understand a word of an oak tree, dolphin, or any other creature's communication. Yet, we understand all creatures' evolution by observing their actions. Because we can understand human language, the natural selection of tools is a mess. Innovators tell stories about how their magical new tools will solve real-life pains. While stepmothers pollute minds with fake stories like racism, sexism, elitism, and other bullshit to hide the fact evolution has toppled the technological power structure that gave them their edge.

Today, our society's huge Industrial Age ideological echo chambers exist to combat evolution.

And they won't stop fighting because, like it did with biological lifeforms so many times before, evolution has entered a new chapter in the story of Life. This one is called the Internet Age.

## Old Age, Ladder Climb, Final Frontier

In 55 BC, the Roman general Julius Caesar had a problem. His prosperous territory kept getting raided by Germans living across the Rhine River. Caesar defeated the raiders in battle, but that's why the Germans avoided fighting him. Instead, the barbarians used small boats to raid Roman villages at night.

So, to protect his society, Caesar had to defeat an enemy that wouldn't fight him.

He came up with an idea. The Germans were a tribal people with no written language, limited metalworking, and primitive engineering. Meanwhile, the Romans built excellent roads, long aqueducts, giant amphitheaters, and seemingly whatever else they wanted.

To showcase their technological power, Caesar decided to build a bridge.

The construction was carried out in an area where the river's depth would be up to nine meters. The bridge was built on double wooden piles driven into the riverbed by winching up a large stone and releasing it, thereby driving the posts into the riverbed. The construction system ensured that the greater the water flow, the harder the bridge was held together. Caesar's soldiers built the bridge in just 10 days.

Watching the Roman legions crossing the mighty Rhine River mystified the Germans.

The barbarians couldn't understand what the heck this "thing" was that let people walk on water. It would be like us today, watching people fly to the Moon on a couch. We'd be confused (to say the least) because human psychology needs to learn a technology [before we can comfortably use it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZcOKhYI57Y)

Caesar defeated the Germans by educating them about technological evolution. He showcased Roman mastery of the Classic Age and Germans being hundreds of years behind in the Iron Age. So impressed by Rome's levers of almost magical powers, the Germans made peace for generations.

Biological evolution is tracked in eras like the famous Jurassic period. For humans, the chapters of evolution are the ages of new technology. The tools we create, use, and understand determine where we are in the story of Life. Here is a list of all the technological ages and the civilizations that led humanity to each.

  - Bronze Age:     2000 - 1250 (Babylon)
  - Iron Age:       1250 - 550  (Greece)
  - Classic Age:    550 - 476   (Rome)
  - Middle Ages:    500 - 1439  (Abbasid)
  - Renaissance:    1440 - 1686 (Italy)
  - Science Age:    1687 - 1759 (France)
  - Industrial Age: 1760 - 1969 (America)
  - Internet Age:   1970 -      (TBD)
*** This list is Mediterranean-centric. Read "Guns, Germs, and Steel" to learn why. Remember, there are many more years ahead of us than behind us.

As Julius Caesar demonstrated, the difference between technological ages is enormous. A fundamental new technology is an entirely new stage of evolution, with a totally different list of traits in the hands of its people. There is no biological difference between peoples of different ages, but their levers of power certainly are different. Going from one chapter to another, like from Bronze to Iron, requires re-inventing and re-learning everything: transportation, agriculture, war, healthcare, music, self-defense, medicine, and everything else that makes up a civilization.

As we already discussed, biological evolution is slow but involuntary; thus, the biological game of evolution never stops.

Technological evolution isn't so certain. 

After seeing Caesar's bridge, the Germans didn't enter the Classic Age for hundreds of more years. The Romans stalled their advancement and were invaded and colonized by those same Germans. Advancing a civilization requires leaving the old one behind, which for many nations is so hard that it never happens.

One reason for this is personal happiness. Evolution is complex, challenging, and filled with failure. And new isn't always better. The best martial arts techniques are often the classic ones like left jabs and rear naked chokes. Sleep is often the best medicine. So, humans won't necessarily be happily combing through the many new traits each new age brings.

Regardless, Life demands the hard work of evolution. Adapting is the only way Life survives. The biggest reason for our refusal to evolve is the loyalty stories foster in humanity. Stories are meant to pass on knowledge to help people learn new tools and techniques. However, the people in power use stories to distract regular people from evolving new tools because new tools have new power bases.

America won the Industrial Age. It did so with hard work, ingenuity, and injustice. In 1970, America invented the personal computer and the internet. This technology is the future, but we are not yet in the Internet Age for the same reasons, seeing Caesar's bridge didn't upgrade the German barbarians all those years ago.

Evolving our society to the possibilities of modern technology requires holding teachers, leaders, trainers, pundits, and individuals up to the standards of evolution. Any story about "wokeness," "fascists," and all the other content filling out televisions and smartphones are only meant to keep us in the Industrial Age while laying blame for the social, economic, and other real-life pains that inevitably get worse when any creature stops playing the game of evolution.

<Flipper1970 />

_Ignoring evolution has us walking in circles inside a death spiral._

## Building the Bridge

All creatures must evolve. Once you realize humans can't evolve biologically, this new philosophy falls into place: technological evolution is the plot of human existence. But while storytelling connects us to good tools, it also keeps us loyal to old ones. So, we're often masked from the fact that our only path to success is leaving old ways of Life behind to harvest resources in a new way.

Although we can't evolve biologically, individuals with secure food, shelter, and water still have a biology telling them to defend their bounty. That's why we have many Industrial Age ideological stepmothers in our body politic.

The Industrial Age's way of Life is based around technology like broadcast radio and television, school libraries and lecture halls, corporate offices and meeting rooms, car and truck transportation, suburban housing and home remodeling, and so on down the Left and Right tools and techniques catalog. These adaptations are no longer enough to empower their users to climb ladders in the game of evolution.

So we don't climb the ladder to the Internet Age.

Instead, we continue industrializing society with too many large roads, cars, homes, planes, televisions, one-time-use products, and other mass-produced industrial goods. Regular people are left being Cinderella locked in the attic, wanting a better Life. Lacking the power of evolution in their minds, ordinary people must tell stories within either Conservative or Progressive ideology to justify why they should get priority access to the dwindling carcass of the Industrial Age.

- Hi, I'm a Progressive Activist. Years ago, my creativity imagined the Industrial Age policies and tools that spread unimaginable wealth to humankind. After the Industrial Age ended in 1969, I kept selling those same tools and policies; now they're totally bizarre. That's why my art films, marketing campaigns, and protests are a terrible return on investment. I used easy credit, cheap labor, and cheap energy to sustain my adaptations for decades, but they're both running out. To hide my ineffectiveness, I've been using a justice-loving public philosophy that because my, or someone else, parents and grandparents were abused and disadvantaged, I should still get the money I need to pay my mortgage and grocery bills. Take it from the Fascist Conservatives because they are greedy and evil and deserve nothing!

- Hi, I'm a Conservative Businessman. Years ago, my industriousness built the Industria Age's amazing companies, tools, and wealth for mankind. After the Industrial Age ended in 1969, I kept selling the same tools and companies using flashy spectacle. American homes, vehicles, and televisions are now enormous! They do the same functions, though, so we had to use easy credit, cheap labor, and cheap energy to pay for it all, and now it's running out. To hide my years of ineffectiveness, I've been using a liberty-loving public philosophy that says I should still get the money to pay my mortgage and grocery bills because my parents or grandparents were intelligent and hard-working. Take it from those lazy and evil Socialist Woke Progressives. They deserve nothing!

- I don't like politics. But as the cost of living rates go up, I'm looking for answers. I'm starting to think `insert name here` people are terrible, so I'm joining `insert name here.` My unspoken concern is that the technology that underpins my job is becoming obsolete, which sucks because I was planning on working at Blockbuster forever. I love Netflix, by the way; what are you watching?

- None of us knows what the `https:` on websites means.

We're an Industrial Age species trying to live in the Internet Age. Our real-life problems are mounting like they are for the polar bears. Tragically, the chance to bring our debt, inflation, insurance, and the cost of living rates<button @click="rdegg = !rdegg">*</button>down proactively and ease ourselves into the next chapter in the story of Life has passed.

Life has let 99% of all prior species die because they failed to harvest enough resources to procreate. Anyone who refuses to adapt to the possibilities of new Internet Age technology and instead follows, protests, and invests in Industrial Age ideologies, cultures, and societies is writing themselves on that list.

You don't have to join them.

Techvolution was written to individuals because individuals are evolution's unit of selection. Tall, short, Nigerian, Japanese, rich, poor, grade "A" student or not, it doesn't matter what group you were in the past. Nature gave individuals the right to evolve. Whoever adopts mixed-ideological politics and becomes a bumblebee searching the ecosystem for solutions to their pains selects themselves into the future.

Once you upgrade your politics with Techvolultion and its mixed-ideological politics you'll escape the attic and cross the bridge to the Internet Age. Once there, you'll notice how large the Internet Age ecosystem already is. Many inventors used their souls to create millions of incredibly cool Internet Age technology.

Bumblebee economics is ready; you only need to pollinate it.

The Internet Age has billions of products. No single ideology can filter them for you. You are unique. You need to mix-and-match tools and techniques to find which solve your frontline pains. And you can take whatever you want from prior civilizations with you. Your choices will define what gets saved from extinction.

Keep reading, and you will learn how open-source software and interoperable technology standards put wealth-generating power in your and everyone else's hands. Tools like React, Git, Ruby on Rails, USB, Linux, Shopify, YouTube, and so much more await you to discover your niche.

Evolution is inevitable. Techvolution, mixed-ideological politics, and bumblebee economics are the future. You will reinvent Life on Earth in the Internet Age. Jeff Goldblum says so. Why would anyone not follow him?

>If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that Life will not be contained. Life breaks free. It expands to new territories. It crashes through barriers. Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is....Life...finds a way.

[Ian Malcolm, Jurassic Park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiVVzxoPTtg)

I wish this summary was original. It's actually a remake.

Years ago, our ancestors had to evolve from the Medieval Age. Before they did, they had to drop the Catholic and Protestant political philosophy that said God wanted kings and queens to rule countries forever. If ever there was a public-facing philosophy designed to hold back everyone's evolution, it was the idea that firstborn sons always make for capable leaders.

Conservative and Progressive philosophers worked hard to detach Catholic and Protestant political theology from daily politics. They did it by creating religious toleration. After that came the separation of church and state and the freedom for people to mix-and-match their religious beliefs. Catholics and Protestants were thereafter free to work together to great mutual benefit during the Industrial Age via their shared ideology of regulated free-market capitalism.

Capitalism, of course, had a competitor, communism. Capitalism won because it unknowingly harnessed evolution. Its free-market principles empowered Life's game pieces--individuals--to buy and sell products that best solved their frontline pains. Regulation ensured wealth wasn't concentrated too much in the hands of the stepmothers of the world.

Communism was different. It empowered ideologically educated bureaucrats to plan the economy. These middlemen decided what tools and techniques strangers needed in their fight to survive. Unsurprisingly, within two generations, the foolhardy communist dream joined the 99% of all species that are dead.

Old philosophers didn't know about evolution, so it was hard to harness it. Techvolution takes some of what worked in old philosophies and includes the lessons of technological evolution.

As it does for all creatures, Mother Nature decided individual freedom works. America won the Industrial Age in the game of evolution. Our civilization canonized evolutionary freedom inside our constitutions, bills of rights, and democratic government. Life's evolution went smoother once authority was subject to frontline pain via a system of checks and balances. Stepmother stories fell in the face of problem-solving. As for our economic problems today. We must only realize that regulated capitalism allows technology to evolve freely at home, not at work.

This "Techvolution" is just more liberal elitism undermining real American values. I'll stick with proven conservatism and capitalism over this pseudo-scientific nonsense any day.

The "Techvolution" is just a ploy by the capitalist elite to undermine our vital progressive work. We need bold, revolutionary action, not compromises with the oppressors.

"Techvolution? More like techno-socialism trying to brainwash us away from the free market principles that made America great."

"I'll take good old-fashioned conservatism over this fancy 'evolutionary biology' nonsense any day. This is just liberal elites trying to undermine our values."

"Forget Techvolution - I'm sticking with the time-tested wisdom of capitalism and traditional family values, not some pseudo-intellectual fad."

"Techvolution is nothing but a distraction from the real revolutionary change we need. It's just the establishment trying to co-opt our movement."

"This 'Techvolution' is just another ploy by the oppressive capitalist class to maintain their grip on power. We won't compromise our socialist principles!"

"Down with Techvolution! We need bold, systemic transformation, not more empty rhetoric from ivory tower academics out-of-touch with the people's struggle."

"Techvolution? More like a Trojan horse for big government socialism to trample all over good old American capitalism and Christian values!"

"This 'evolutionary biology' nonsense is just liberal elites trying to brainwash hardworking patriots. I'll take my chances with the free market, thank you very much!"

"Forget Techvolution - I'd rather let a swarm of illegal immigrant locusts devour this country than let some ivory tower academics destroy our God-given conservative principles!"

"Techvolution? More like a dog whistle for the oppressive capitalist class to maintain their stranglehold on the means of production and crush the working class revolution!"

"This so-called 'Techvolution' is nothing but a shiny new distraction from the real systematic change we need - the gloves are coming off, comrades, and the bourgeoisie better watch out!"

"Techvolution? I'd rather eat glass than compromise our socialist ideals with some watered-down, corporate-friendly pseudo-science nonsense. The people's struggle cannot be contained!"

"World wars, economic collapse, climate change - that's all just fear-mongering as far as I'm concerned. I'll be long gone before any of that affects my cushy little life."

"Techvolution, civil unrest, environmental catastrophe? Sounds like a whole lot of hysteria to me. I've got mine, so why should I worry about the future?"

"The left wants revolution, the right wants to burn it all down. Meanwhile, I'll be sipping my mojito on the beach, safe from all their petty squabbles."

"Ideological extremists can fight it out all they want, but I'll be insulated from the fallout in my gated community. Techvolution? More like tech-no-thanks for me."

"Global instability, resource wars, societal collapse? That's a 'you' problem, not a 'me' problem. I plan to ride out whatever apocalypse is coming in the comfort of my private bunker."

"Let the world tear itself apart over Techvolution, socialism, or whatever the flavor of the month is. I'll be too busy enjoying my lavish retirement to get dragged into that mess."

"Techvolution opened my eyes to the fundamental laws governing human progress - no more getting bogged down in left-right ideological nonsense."

"Instead of parroting partisan talking points, Techvolution showed me how to ask the right questions and discover my own solutions to everyday challenges."

"Gone are the days of feeling helpless in the face of global crises. Techvolution equipped me with an evolutionary framework to navigate our technology-driven world."

"Techvolution isn't about easy answers, it's about developing the critical thinking skills to tackle complex problems head-on. A refreshing change from political theatrics."

"Rather than wasting time fighting the same old culture wars, Techvolution inspired me to leverage technology and innovation to improve my own life and community."

"Techvolution may not offer entertainment value, but it gave me something far more valuable - the tools to be an active agent of positive change, not just a spectator."

## What the ideologues say

*clears throat and speaks in a gruff, dismissive tone*

Bah, this "Techvolution" nonsense is just more of that liberal, elitist garbage trying to undermine good, honest American values. Who does this author think they are, trying to lecture us with their fancy "evolutionary biology" and "fundamental laws of life"? 

What happened to just standing up for hard work, family, and the free market? This is just another scheme by the left-wing academics to brainwash people and turn them against traditional conservatism and capitalism. 

And don't even get me started on how they're trashing the Left and Right as "ideologues" and "entertainment." That's rich coming from someone who's probably some coastal elite who's never set foot in a real factory or family-owned business. 

No, I'll stick with the tried-and-true principles that have made this country great, thank you very much. This "Techvolution" is just another fancy name for socialism and big government overreach. I'll take my chances with the good old Left-Right divide any day over this pseudo-scientific mumbo jumbo.

*spits on the ground* The only "progress" I care about is putting America and hardworking Americans first. This author can take their evolutionary nonsense and shove it.

--

*speaks in an indignant, self-righteous tone*

Ugh, this "Techvolution" nonsense is just another ploy by the capitalist elite to undermine the hard-fought progress we've made on the left. Who does this author think they are, trying to lecture us about "evolutionary biology" and "fundamental laws of life" as if that's somehow more enlightened than our proven socialist principles?

This is clearly just a thinly veiled attempt to discredit the vital work we're doing to dismantle systemic oppression, address climate change, and create a more equitable society. They want to act all high and mighty about being "moderate" and "pragmatic," but we all know that's just code for preserving the status quo and protecting the interests of the wealthy few.

And the way they dismiss the Left and Right as mere "ideologues" and "entertainment" is so condescending and elitist. As if our hard-fought ideological battles aren't the very foundation for the progress we've made! This author probably thinks they're so clever, but they're just another mouthpiece for the capitalist machine, trying to undermine the revolutionary spirit of the people.

Well, I've got news for them - we're not going to back down or compromise our values just to appease some so-called "moderate" agenda. The time for half-measures is over. We need bold, transformative action to create the just, sustainable world we know is possible. This "Techvolution" is nothing but a distraction from the real work that needs to be done.

*slams fist on table* No more playing nice with the oppressors. It's time to fight for a future that works for everyone, not just the wealthy elite. This author can take their evolutionary pseudoscience and shove it - the revolution is coming, whether they like it or not!

"Techvolution is just a ploy by the capitalist elite to undermine our vital progressive work. Why do we need wealth creation and distribution at the same time. We need bold, revolutionary action, not compromises with the oppressors. Let my grandkids worry about petty things like the rising cost of living."

# Co-Evolution

Q: Certainly! Here's a brief explanation of co-evolution:

A: Co-evolution refers to the process where two or more species evolve in response to each other. It is a reciprocal evolutionary interaction where changes in one species lead to changes in another species, and vice versa. This can happen when species interact closely, such as in predator-prey relationships, symbiotic relationships, or in the case of parasites and their hosts. As one species evolves adaptations, the other species must also evolve to maintain the interaction, leading to an ongoing evolutionary "arms race" between the species. Co-evolution can drive the emergence of complex and intricate relationships between species over long periods of time.


Q: Certainly! The co-evolution of flowers and bees is a classic example of co-evolution. Here's a brief explanation:

A: Flowers and bees have evolved in a mutually beneficial relationship over millions of years. Bees rely on flowers as a source of nectar and pollen, which they use as food. In return, flowers rely on bees for pollination, which allows them to reproduce and spread their species.

As flowers evolved more complex and specialized structures to attract bees, such as bright colors, nectar guides, and specific shapes, bees evolved adaptations to better access and collect the nectar and pollen. For example, bees developed specialized mouthparts and leg structures to efficiently gather and transport the floral resources.

Similarly, as bees evolved to become more efficient pollinators, flowers evolved to become more specialized to cater to the bees' needs. This includes the development of landing platforms, nectar guides, and even specific flower shapes that match the body structure of bees.

This ongoing co-evolutionary process has resulted in a highly specialized and mutually beneficial relationship between flowers and bees, where both species have evolved in response to each other over long periods of time. This co-evolution has contributed to the incredible diversity of both flowering plants and bee species we see today.

## Glossary of Terms

**Evolution:** Evolution is the change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations. It occurs when evolutionary processes such as natural selection, genetic drift, mutation, and gene flow act on the genetic variation within a population, resulting in certain characteristics becoming more or less common over time. Evolution is an ongoing process that has no fixed timescale - it can happen rapidly or slowly depending on the specific circumstances. The process of evolution has given rise to the vast biodiversity observed at all levels of biological organization, from molecules to ecosystems.

**Techvolution:** Philosophies frame the human experience for our minds. Techvolution says humans should see ourselves as technological species. Since modern humans use technology to do most everything from staying warm to growing food, Techvolution says the tools we use define our place in the world. Techvolution points out that humanity is subject to the same laws of evolution as all other creature, thus we must embrace it to better our futures.

**Mixed-Ideological Politics:** The political philosophy of Techvolution. Humans as a technological species harvests resources according to the tools we use or control. The technology of the Industrial Rebolution was relatively weak. Huge factories, radio networks, transport, required much man-power and thus . We'll go into mixed-ideological politics more in its own book.

**Bumblebee Economics:** The economics system of Techvolution. In evolutionary theory individual organisms are the "unit of selection"; meaning each creature is free to interact with the ecosystem and make its own choices. The ones who harvest the most resources and breed the most successful offspring are "selected" by evolution to survive. Since humanity operates a technological ecosystem, we must enable individuals to do business with each other directly. This means technology must be standardized, open-source, and controlled by individuals so that the best choices made by individuals can be selected by evolution. We'll do into the blueprints of Bumblebee Economics in its own book, specifically written for open-source heroes to kickstart it.

We'll add more definitions as we learn more about Techvolution.

This gives us a reliable test for evaluating our world. If someone's version of truth keeps changing with the times, be suspicious—genuine truth reflects eternal natural laws. But if someone's products refuse to evolve with the times, be equally suspicious—useful tools must adapt to serve us in changing environments. Any unnatural behavior is a person trying to pretend evolution's mission does not apply to them.

### TECHVOLUTION: A Platform Discussion**

A One Act Dialogue

**Scene 1: The Platform**
A commuter train platform during morning rush hour. Digital displays shows "Delayed" in red letters. Commuters stand by, most looking at their phones. Building shadows are long, the sun is still rising, although we can't see it with the many nearby buildings.

Enter SOCRATES, 65, stocky build, military bearing despite his age, wearing a high-quality black backpack with Army insignia on it. He carries a thermos as he gazes and the people around him.

ANNOUNCEMENT: The 7:15 train is approaching now. Please stand back from the yellow platform lines. We are sorry for the delay.

Socrates watches the people around him lift their heads from the phones. As the speeding train is grinding its brake pads to stop its massive bulk, he lets out a gruff. As the train stops, people start huddling near the doors waiting for them to open.

Socrates walks to rear of the group and shuffles in as everyone goes inside. The seats are half full already, and as people find spots, Socrates climbs a small set of stairs to go up to the next level. There he sees a spot near a window and takes it.

As he looks around, some people are again on their phones, while others have pulled out their work laptops and are typing away. He continues searching and sees an advertisement poster for TELECOM inside the train.

5G SPEEDS ANYWHERE AT ANY TIME. WATCH. DOWNLOAD. UPLOAD. COMMUNICATE AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT

Another poster says.

GO TRAIN. HAPPY TO TAKE YOU TO YOUR OFFICE

The train has already starting moving. Socrates watches the landscape go by. Still the shadows of the buildings break up the landscape of the waking city.

ANNOUNCEMENT: Shrewsbury. This stop is Shrewsbury.

Commuters are shuffling onto the train again. Seats are almost full as DARWIN, 50, sits across from Socrates.

Wearing a field jacket over business casual clothes, Darwin is carrying a weathered leather messenger bag and green Patagonia pants.

SOCRATES: Nice mama jeans.

DARWIN: She bought them.

SOCRATES: She must have wanted you to stand out. I can see why sitting among this crowd.

DARWIN: Not a fan one's travelling peers.

SOCRATES: Someone could be choking and I doubt anyone would notice. It's the attention, seems to be have been stolen or something thereabouts. Whatever I am, I am not a peer by that standard.

DARWIN: I don't much look at humans to be honest. But travelling does require an escape.

SOCRATES: Journeyed far before?

DARWIN: I've been on a few long journeys. Charles. Nice to meet you.

The two men shake hands.

SOCRATES: Socrates. My pleasure. So, why would the ever caring mother purchase such ugly pants.

DARWIN: They help me. I'm what they call a naturalist. I study animals, creatures, bugs, worms, birds, and creatures lives out in nature among the leaves, mud, and dirt.

SOCRATES: Quite unclean. I could never. I prefer the finer pursuits.

DARWIN: What are finer pursuits pray tell.

SOCRATES: What is, is the question. What is truth, justice, virtue, the good society. I usually need a few others to ask questions, and then we answer them, over and over until we get somewhere.

DARWIN: The answer?

SOCRATES: We get closer to one. We learn moderation at least, because how close of an answer can we humans ever get to. What do you do?

DARWIN: Go out into nature. Observe. Collect samples. Have an idea to explain what I see, and use the evidence to determine if the idea was correct. Then do it all over again.

SOCRATES: The two methods seems similar.

DARWIN: They're probably related in some way. What have been some of your happiest realizations.

SOCRATES: Oh am I happy you wear those ugly jeans. Nothing. Or understanding that I know that I know nothing is the root of all knowledge.

DARWIN: No emotions.

SOCRATES: Get them out of my city and souls. Unless the city is under threat. Then we need some bravado. But otherwise, knowledge starts with the wisest words "I know nothing". Then we can understand our souls, tame our beastly natures, which opens us to virtue, and finally wisdom.

DARWIN: Sounds like a solid foundation for a civilization.

SOCRATES: They're open ideas, anyone can use them. Maybe the method will find an audience. But, I must be honest. It can cause some tension.

DARWIN: Not among God?

SOCRATES: The gods, no. The kings, lords, and parental masters.

DARWIN: I hear that.

SOCRATES: You have experience?

DARWIN: You know those observations I like to make.

SOCRATES: In the mud.

DARWIN: Precisely. We'll, I made a few, connected some dots, and upended the perceptions of many people.

SOCRATES: Score one for observation. That method might catch on too.

DARWIN: I expect big things. Bigger thinks. Newton really deserves lots of credit. The gravity thing and all.

Socrates indicates he's not following. 

DARWIN: Wisest of them all but not too knowledgeable yet. Issac Newton, from the Cambridge stop, he had a apple fall on his head, as the story goes, and realized something big.

SOCRATES: I like these realizations.

DARWIN: Indeed. You see, Newton realized if the apple falls on Earth, then it would fall up on the Moon, and planets and everywhere. The same force that applies to us here, applies everywhere!

SOCRATES: Like universal truth!

DARWIN: Yes!

The two share a moment of silence. They look around, Socrates at the people in the train, Darwin outside at the trees and birds.

SOCRATES: People still looking at their phones?

DARWIN: They are busy working, like ants.

SOCRATES: Why would you reduce humanity to bugs?

DARWIN: We share so much in common.

SOCRATES: I do see them at the agorae. Maybe I should stop walking all over them. Instead I can say "Hello Ant, want to come to Agathon party tonight. There is lots of figs." Might make better company.

DARWIN: They wouldn't disagree with you.

SOCRATES: They aren't sophists, is what I mean. You know those people who will say anything someone pays them too really get under my skin.

DARWIN: Like the ants.

Darwin gives Socrates a minute to relax.

SOCRATES: What truth can ants take you? Expect what it means to be an ant?

DARWIN: That is not what I do, although I suspect another naturalist will come to great conclusions answering that question.

SOCRATES: Aristotle might like this. He likes going on walks.

DARWIN: I'm aware of him. He has a stupendous mind, but made some errors along the way.

SOCRATES: Good thing we got methods to correct them.

DARWIN: Good point.

SOCRATES: So...what happened?

DARWIN: Let's go back Newton.

SOCRATES: The apple guy.

DARWIN: And gravity. Optics. Calculus. A bunch of stuff. But the point is, Newton finished the revolution in the world. He proved that the Earth orbits the Sun.

SOCRATES: No way.

DARWIN: It's true. These rays, coming from the Sun, are always shining. The earth rotates into it like this.

Darwin takes his tennis ball, and rotates it around the light, as the Earth spinning as it orbits the Sun.

SOCRATES: This would be quite the realization. What about stellar parallax? Why don't the stars move in the sky, if our Earth is moving?

DARWIN: They are just that far away. The Sun is just another star.

SOCRATES: Anaxagoras was right? Good for him. 

Darwin sees something outside. Two birds. He then makes a note and starts a sketch in his notebook.

DARWIN: You don't write anything done?

SOCRATES: I have the worst penmanship. Can't make heads or tails of it. Good memory. Doesn't cause me any problems.

DARWIN: Well... it is what it is.

SOCRATES: How did they see the stars move?

DARWIN: The telescope.

SOCRATES: The what?

DARWIN: Telescope. Two lenses opposite each other, magnify objects. We got a microscope too.

SOCRATES: I'm not following.

DARWIN: 
SOCRATES: 
DARWIN: 


---

DARWIN: What if we're living in an ant hill, one made of technology instead of dirt.

SOCRATES: Tell me more about evolution by way of natural selection.

So, although a rose has visible characteristics like flowers to attract pollinators and thorns to protect against being eaten, these are only the most visible in response to our interactions with it. Most of its features, from the green chlorophyll that enables photosynthesis, to the rigid cells that overcome gravitational challenges, are direct responses to the physical and environmental constraints acting upon it as determined by the laws of nature acting inside an ecosystem.

These features, hidden inside our DNA, are what species share in common. It is these common features between plants, fungus, animals that work together to keep life alive. The features such as thorns and red flowers are just the jerseys lifeform wear while everyone ultimately plays for the same team.

## Chapter 1—Earth Is A Game Board

### Introduction

What makes evolution such a persistent and universal process? Why has it been not only around since the beginning of complex life, but the driver of countless species over billions of years?

Answering this question means understanding why lifeforms aren't fundamentally at odds with each other. There is, of course, some conflict. A pack of wolves attacking a bear, or hunting a deer is a daily—and very visible—occurrence. But most creatures, from worms to oak trees to wolves do not even knowingly interact, let alone compete.

Because life is not a game of king of the hill, with only one species left standing. In fact, none would survive if left alone, as no lifeform can exist in isolation.

That's why life creates ecosystems. Inside lifeforms are assigned different roles, each with a strict job. Only when the ecosystem is working properly, can individuals thrive.

An ecosystem is an interdependent system where organisms work with each other. Every organism and species plays a crucial role in the complex web of life. Producers, typically green plants and algae, create their own food through photosynthesis and provide energy for the entire system.

Herbivores like deer and birds eat these plants, simultaneously helping to spread seeds. Carnivores like wolves and eagles keep herbivore populations in check. When creatures die, decomposers like bacteria and fungi break down dead matter and their nutrients, fertilizing the ground to empower the next generation to continue life's evolution.

This circle of life is a constant cycle of energy transfer and nutrient recycling that keeps the ecosystem balanced and functioning.

Balance and momentum are essential. For example, when wolves were removed from Yellowstone Park, the deer soon exploded in population. As they massed near riverbanks, soil was compacted and plants could no longer grow. Once vibrant rivers and creeks were near barren. When wolves were re-introduced, deer numbers were lowered, river soil was no longer compacted, thus plants thrived again and rivers returned to their natural glory.

All because the ecosystem is like a team. Only when each position is filled, is the system in the right balance between all its component individual players.

Ecosystems also include non-living elements like sunlight, water, soil, and climate. Each of these resources change with the seasons. If lifeforms are the players, this varied arena of available energy, food, temperature, and resources makes up a sort of game board for lifeforms to live and die in.

The fundamental forces of nature—physics, chemistry, geology—control this game board. Thus an ecosystem of producers, herbivores, carnivores, and decomposers must continually evolve because their shared game board is constantly altered as per eternal and remorseless laws of nature.

Evidenced by how rare life is, these forces do not make it easy to keep winning the game. That's why lifeforms do not compete. Rather they must collaborate in order to stay alive. Hence, the evolution of life is a timeless and constant process, because the eternal laws of physics, chemistry, and geology are too. 

Understanding the workings of these hidden forces of nature, releases us from being members of the animal kingdom, to being philosophers of it. Evolution's selection process is not a mere random occurrence, but a profound dialogue between life and the fundamental laws of nature. When organisms face challenges like extreme cold, scarcity of food, radiation exposure, or geological disruptions, they are essentially engaging in a complex survival test with the universe's natural laws.

Yet these laws that make life so hard, are also the unyielding framework upon which all creatures must use to construct themselves and live. This survival through adaptation applies to biological and technology life, as both must navigate the same dialogue with nature's fundamental laws.

Only by understanding life's profound struggle to harness and survive against the very laws that challenge its existence can we truly appreciate the remarkable journey of evolution. Because we can never break them, must suffer them whilst using them, the universal laws of nature are effectively the rules of the game of evolution.

As we forge a new technological identity, we must understand these rules. Currently, we too often observe exterior attributes and believe we understand ourselves and each other. But that's like knowing a rose by touching its thorns and smelling its flowers. Visible characteristics are merely surface-level interactions. True understanding of today's human condition emerges from decoding the fundamental laws of nature that shape our existence and influence our daily experiences.

Thankfully, science has already delved into the depths of physics, chemistry, and geology to understand biological life. All we need to do is continue this journey to unravel the mysteries behind our technological evolution.

In the pages that follow, we will lay the groundwork for comprehending the remarkable story of how life, and ultimately human civilization, has emerged and evolved within the constraints of the natural laws.

It's important to note the process of understanding the rules of the game has its own recurring story.

First, we experienced the world through our senses, brains, and simple tools, creating narratives to interpret our perceptions. As tools improved, we gained more understanding and slowly transitioned from mysticism to using philosophy to discern natural laws. Finally, real understanding emerged when scientific instruments and the scientific method tore the face off of nature and showed us the laws that guide not just biological evolution, but our emerging technological species.

Processing insurance claims is challenging but often rewarding too. Many times you get to actually help people. One of my favorites was just before Christmas. A young family's home was broken into, presents stolen, and worst their fire extinguisher was sprayed all through the house out of pure malice.

A real-life grinch had arrived.

The particles looked like snow, but need to be clean up. Normally it would be a week or so of a hotel stay while. But it being Christmas, I wanted to help a family enjoy the season. 

So I arranged a temporary condo for them, approved buying new presents, and got the place decorated for Christmas. The parents appreciated it very much. It kind of felt like the end of Home Alone 2 being when the Toy Store filled the McAllister family's Plaza hotel room.

The season creates so much good will between people because the power of presents. Something wrapped in paper creates anticipation that create a sense of wonder.

That is the sense I want to tap into here. For to understand why technological evolution should give us a new identity means to open a present. Wanting to know what it is, and the first thing you grab is a booklet.

===

Insurance claims can be stressful. People have a unplanned problem and want their the insurance policy they've never read will save them. But each person has a different idea what constitutes a problem and a solution. 

But as already mentioned, being at the intersection of what customers think will happen after a encountering a theft, flood, or other real-world problem, versus what is going to happen, is an excellent education in what is happening in the world today.

Some claims are straightforward—a rational person deals with a broken window, a fender bender. Buy them a new one and they're happy to move on. However, claims become puzzles when people's mindsets get pricked. Either they feel neglected, misled by marketing, or think their stuff is more valuable than the market does.

These puzzles never declare themselves. Instead, they're revealed by listening to the person to understand their problems and mindset. Doing this assessments all day, thousands of times, is what helped informed me about our technological identity.

Before we begin that long journey, here's story about how. It's one of my most memorable claims. It arrive one cold December afternoon, just days before Christmas.

What we call the "Notice of Loss" arrived on my desk. A young family's home had been robbed. I called the parents and found out someone—likely some punks but maybe a someone with a gripe—had broken in, stolen appliances, cash, jewelry, and even the presents under the tree.

Worst as, the criminals embodied the infamous Grinch. Upon leaving, they sprayed the entire house with a fire extinguisher. The white chemical powder blanketing every surface may have looked like snow, nut its unsafe, especially for kids. In the middle of the holiday season, a family home was turned into a violated, thieved, uninhabitable space.

Yet, the parents were only talking about one thing. It wasn't their hurt feelings or the the true market value of their family heirlooms (which is common). They only cared about their kids lost Christmas.

Claims always pile up this time of year, and this one was not any more tragic then the house fires and car thefts I would deal with all day. I could have followed procedures and asked them to get the police report number, write alist of their stolen items, assign cleaning contractors, authorize a hotel stay, and move on to the next case.

But this was Christmas, and getting to problem solve in meaningful ways made this otherwise grubby job occasionally joyful.

Let's spread some cheer!

So, instead of a week in a hotel, I found them a fully furnished condo and had it decorated for Christmas. I also expedited the claim payments to quickly replace their stolen presents.

Within a few days, the family had bedrooms, a full kitchen, a tree, wrapped presents, even milk and cookies. Everything they needed to make Hallmark quality memories. It kind of felt like the end of _Home Alone 2_ when the McCallister family woke up to many presents in their Plaza hotel room.

The parents were grateful and congratulated me on my recent promotion. Unlike most feedback, which comes when something goes wrong, their comment "I can see why you got it" was particularly meaningful. I'd solved their problem by understanding their mindset, not just following standard procedures.

I didn't always manage to solve a problem so well. But this one shows what it takes.

There's a mixture of rules like insurance and legal, ever present but rarely understood. People a unique mindset and goal. And variety of technology that needs to be customized to solve the problem while satisfying the person's mindset and not contravening the rules. 

The lesson we need here, is while problems have obstacles rules in between optimal solution, the more complex the problem the deeper we must go to to find the underlying structures.

And, updating our own self-perceptions with a new technological identity requires us to go very deep indeed. 

So let me offer up another present. It's sitting under the tree with your name on it. Like a joyous kid, I hope you grab it with huge anticipation, tear apart the bow, wrapping paper, and toss open the box.

What's inside? A journey into understanding how technology reshapes who we are.

So you grab the first thing you see. A booklet.

In our technological evolution, entropy is not just a physical law, but a critical rule of the game. Every technological innovation is essentially a temporary rebellion against disorder. When we build a computer, construct a city, or develop a complex system, we are creating momentary islands of organization in an universe that constantly tends towards chaos.

Our survival—and our emergence as a technological species—depends on our ability to understand and momentarily resist this fundamental rule. We are not fighting entropy, but negotiating with it. Each technological breakthrough is a sophisticated strategy in this ongoing negotiation, a way of creating temporary structures that can withstand the universe's tendency towards disorder.

This is why our choices matter. This is why we cannot simply take our time. Entropy is the clock that turns the game board against us, challenging us to evolve, to innovate, to create more resilient and adaptive technologies. Our technological identity is not just about what we build, but about how effectively we can create and maintain order in a universe that constantly seeks to dissolve it.


Because energy and time are interconnected too. That means energy/life must not only survive current game board/entropy, but pass on a baton to the next being. (evolutionary test.)

### The Laws of Physics

Imagine standing on a sandy beach. Warm sunlight is washing over your face as waves smash at your feet. You are a lifeform—one of Earth's creatures who, despite all their differences in looks and instincts, share one overwhelming feature: a limited lifespan.

To give your genes a better chance of survival, you want to join (or help form) an ecosystem with the proper balance of producers, grazers, predators, and decomposers. Often that requires venturing to find new niches.

Standing on that beach, how would you get there?

Most every species has faced this problem one time or another. And because it involves motion, energy, and navigation, it is a physics problem—a collection of natural laws that comprise a big portion of the "rules of the game", the laws we must use to keep advancing on the game board of evolution.

As evidenced by the many species spread throughout Earth, this problem has been solved by biological species for billions of years. Birds use wind patterns to fly across oceans. Plants make seeds that glide, stick, or float their ways to new soils. Sea turtles swim and navigate the world by sensing the Earth's magnetic fields.

Humans once were bound to such biological solutions. In fact we ventured across the globe using them. But our anatomy could only take us so far. Eventually we hit a sandy beach and could go no further.

But our drive to venture out was still strong.

As we developed technology, we collected the tools needed to solve the problem of energy, motion, and navigation to venture out from that sandy beach.

Here are three ways in which we overcame the laws of physics to settle new landmasses: first through mythological storytelling, then through natural philosophy, and finally through scientific understanding. Each step allowed us to use technology to populate new territories and establish ecosystems and move another square in the never-ending game of evolution.

### Polynesia

In knee deep water you can feel the power of the ocean push your body back and forth. You look out at the vast expanse and see nothing but white capped washes smashing into light blue water. 

You look up at the sky and nothing but sunshine and deep blue skies.

You hear wood clank against wood. Looking back at the beach. Dozens of your best friends are sitting around a large fire pit. The flame is gone but the embers still glow red hot.

One friend nods at you, and you throw two fist fulls of ash into the water. Your friends comes next to you and complete the ceremony by doing the same.

Down the beach are a dozen long slender boats with huge logs on either side. Each has rigging setups with square sails and rows of long oars. Each is filled with fruits and coconuts.

You are your friends are set for a trip. With all the preparations made, there is nothing to do but wait for darkness.

Because although the Sun's ray provide warmth, energy, and sight, it also obscures map to their home. 

As the Sun's rays disappear over the horizon, the vast array of lights and colors appear once again. The group of male and females stand up, walk to their ships, push them into the water and set off.

You get in your ship. While others grab hold of their oars, you keep looking at the sky. You see where each light is, where the current of water is going, and point a long red arrow in a direction.

The other ships duly take note and follow your lead.

After a short time, you are on a voyage on the open ocean. Every oar row, conversation, and even breath uses up more energy which takes more food stores to replenish. Getting the directions to your new home correct means getting to your destination before the food and water runs out.

The lights in your sky are the guide. And you are the navigator.

Your family has always been. Thus, you were raised from youth to look up at the stars and see not the dazzling lights or the brilliant colors, but to see the signposts of location. To know the time of year by the location of Tāne, and see the location by your knowledge of Tāwhirimātea. These gods bring forth the winds, rains, and assign the location of stars. Your ancestors wait there for your turn to walk among them.

Your friends keep rowing. They look at you from time to time. They have no way of knowing if they will reach their home in time. All this group can do is have faith in their navigator and in their gods.

So they keep rowing, and keeping following the directions of your long red arrow.

Polynesian maritime exploration represents one of humanity's most remarkable achievements. Beginning around 3000-1000 BC, Polynesians developed sophisticated way-finding techniques that allowed them to settle islands across a vast oceanic region spanning over 10 million square miles; a size bigger than North America.

Islands are at times thousands of miles apart, often with little to no Earthly indicators where the next one will be. Many had healthy ecosystems of trees, grasses, birds, and reptiles. Biological life had already used the rules of the game and learned to navigate to find these new habitats.

But biology took millions of years to spread itself to these islands oasis.

And now, the Polynesians learned to use their minds and technology to do that same. They read complex environmental indicators: ocean currents, wave patterns, wind directions, star positions, and bird migrations. Their traditional voyaging canoes, called waʻa or vaka, were engineering marvels-double-hulled vessels capable of traveling thousands of miles with sophisticated rigging systems.

Navigators, known as palu or matarangi, underwent extensive training from childhood. They memorized thousands of celestial markers, understood intricate wind and current patterns, and could interpret subtle environmental cues invisible to untrained observers.

This maritime technology enabled settlement of islands from Hawaiʻi to New Zealand, Easter Island to the Cook Islands--a testament to human adaptability, technological innovation, and profound understanding of maritime environments.

And yet, all of it was not only pre-science but also pre-philosophy. Polynesians had no written language or mathematics. They learned and pass on an immense understanding of nature with only stories.

The Polynesian understanding of physics was intertwined within their personal identity and civilization. The laws of motion, drag, hydrodynamics, astronomy, were all quantities they must understand before setting off on a weeks long voyage to hit land. Heck, Hawaiians even made it to Peru and back, where they got the sweet potato, a much needed drought resistant crop.

Polynesians not only survived these rules of the game, but used them to prosper. Each voyage was not just a journey, but a complex negotiation with the fundamental rules of physics—reading wind, current, and star as if deciphering an intricate game board where survival was the ultimate prize.

Of course many other societies set sail on the water. But only in one other place did humanity learn to navigate open oceans in such a way. That was the Vikings who had a similarly powerful boats and mythologies but mostly kept to river and costal navigation for their infamous trade and raids. 

Regardless, the Vikings and Polynesians abilities are still very remarkable today.  It's doubtful many societies today could navigate the world and sustain themselves like these peoples did. But technological evolution didn't stop. And there was still other ways for humans and our tools to adapt during the never ending game of evolution.

### Rome

The salt-laden breeze carried the familiar smell of Alexandria's harbor. Marcus Aurelius Ptolemaeus stood motionless, his weathered hands clasped behind his back, watching as laborers loaded amphorae bottles onto his ship—the Isis Mercator. Stacks of grain sacks waited to be loaded as well. A pair of exotic gazelles, destined for some Roman nobleman's villa, shifted nervously in their wooden cages.

The morning sun caught the bronze fittings of his vessel. The Isis Mercator was forty-three feet of carefully constructed pine and cedar, her square sail furled but ready, represented not just a means of transport, but his family's legacy of bringing Egyptian wealth, especially its grain, to the Mediterranean world.

"Almost time," he muttered in Greek, then repeated the phrase in Latin—a habit from years of negotiating across cultures.

The port navigator approached, an older man with skin darkened by decades of sea travel. "The etesian winds aren't favorable yet," he said, pointing to the horizon. "Another day, perhaps two. But you must leave by July 10th to make room for other ships."

Marcus nodded. The winds would determine everything—their speed, safety, and ultimately, profit. Alexandria's grain was critical to Rome, and timing was everything. Sailing against the winds meant endless rowing and inevitable injury to his men. But delay could mean cargo spoilage, and spoilage meant lost reputation followed by quick financial ruin.

He adjusted his lightweight linen tunic, a concession to the Egyptian heat, and checked the small leather pouch containing his navigation tools—an astrolabe, star charts carefully copied from the great library, and letters of introduction that would smooth his passage through various ports.

The caged gazelles bleated softly. Nearby, workers now load the sacks of grain. Each item represented not just trade, but a complex network of human connections stretching across the known world.

He'd wait one or two more days before setting off. But he'd better find something else to buy and load unto his ship to make up for the lost money waiting around two days meant. If he could get some high value copper ingots, delicate glassware, or wrapped scrolls in need of transport, he could make good his lost days.

He reaches for his other pouch, filled with silver coins. Time to head to market. There is a festival on today, he will remove his tunic and try to negotiate a better deal as a poor Greek tourist.

The Polynesians mastered navigation through intimate knowledge of nature's rhythms, using stories and observation to play the game of survival. As human civilization kept expanding, new players entered the game board, each developing increasingly sophisticated strategies to navigate the globe using the universal laws of physics. The Mediterranean world would soon demonstrate a different approach to mastering these rules—one that relied on mathematical precision and expanding technological capabilities.

The Mediterranean is in many ways the geographic opposite to the islands of the Pacific Ocean. The sea is very large with many islands big and small, but its entirely encased by land. Each beach along its shoreline is connected to a very different country, ecology, and geography. Thus, the Mediterranean had all the benefits of water transport speed and ease but without the requirement of open ocean navigation. Thus as its peoples, from Egyptian, Greek, Carthaginian, Roman, and countless others civilizations grew, they could easily to trade with each other.

Maritime trade in the Greco-Roman world transformed the Mediterranean into a vibrant commercial highway. Merchant vessels transported critical commodities like grain, olive oil, wine, and luxury goods between major trading centers such as Alexandria, Athens, and Rome. Roman naval engineering and Greek navigational expertise enabled large cargo ships to traverse vast maritime distances, creating an intricate network of economic and cultural exchange.

Among the many requirements for this network to work best was a shared calendar and navigation system. Otherwise coordinating travel was a nightmare of conversions and misunderstandings. 

Noticing the problem, Julius Caesar introduced the Julian calendar in 45 BC. The Roman lunar calendar was not up to par as it only had 10 months, and was getting increasingly inaccurate and required near constant fiddling. 

Caesar consulted with the Alexandrian astronomer Sosigenes. A student of Greek philosophy, he knew much about where the Sun, planets, and Moon are throughout the year. His new system established a standard 365.25-day year with an extra day every four years, providing a more precise method of tracking time and aligning the calendar with the solar year for every person in the Mediterranean.

Now when a person in Spain set a date, it was true for a person in Rome, Egypt, or Greece as well this year, or 10 years into the future.

With dates settled, how does a person navigate the sea in a predictable way?

This massive problem was answered by Ptolemy. Another Greek philosopher, his works revolutionized navigation by providing a comprehensive mathematical and astronomical framework that maritime explorers used for centuries. His primary contribution was the "Almagest," a groundbreaking treatise that systematized astronomical observations and created mathematical models for predicting celestial movements.

For navigators, Ptolemy's work was essentially a sophisticated navigation manual. His geocentric model, though ultimately incorrect, still provided precise mathematical calculations for determining latitude and longitude using celestial observations. Sailors and navigators used his detailed star charts and mathematical tables to calculate their position at sea by measuring the angles between specific stars and the horizon.

The Ptolemaic system introduced several critical navigational tools. His work detailed precise methods for measuring celestial coordinates, creating astronomical tables that allowed navigators to predict the positions of stars, planets, and other celestial bodies. These calculations were crucial for maritime navigation, especially during long voyages where visual landmarks were absent.

Maritime trade was more than commerce—to supply the countless peoples of the region it needed to become a sophisticated strategy for everyone playing the evolutionary game, where understanding natural laws meant the difference between expansion and extinction.

Everyone still shared knowledge with stories, but used natural philosophy as well. By using the latter's reliable dating and navigation system, the Mediterranean world understood the rules of the game and thereby trade more easily. Even as civilizations rose and fell along the shores of the huge sea ships and navigators would travel the waters, going back and forth from the ports and beaches bring the goods of one area to that of another as they moved their pieces in the game of evolution.

Yet things were not perfect. The Earth was not in fact the center of the Universe. For the the Earth moved like the Moon. Some long suspected it, but in order to know it, we had to prove it. Scientifically.

### The Moon

Loudspeakers crackled inside a packed room. Electronic whine burst for a brief second. The place itself was nondescript. Just one of the countless bland office buildings made in the country's massive drive for results. This building was special only because it was in the middle of the Kazakh prairie. An environment of endless sand, wind, and the Soviet Union's invaluable Baikonur Cosmodrome mega-complex.

Mikhail Sergeyevich Volkov's colleagues gathered around him. They were the designers, now watching with anticipation and restraint to see how their ideas worked out. Years of grueling Soviet scientific training had trained them to restrain their emotions, but today was different. Today was history.

Or it was pre-history. Maybe. They knew nobody would remember this launch, but no one would ever forget its achievements—if the spacecraft could follow the precise flight path calculated by their navigator, comrade Volkov.

"Preliminary launch sequence initiated," the loudspeaker announced what the guys in mission control were doing across the building.

Behind a still face, Volkov agonized. All his colleagues worked together in great unison among intense requirements and deadlines. But most other fields like propulsion, fuel, or material design could at least be tested many times before launch. In comparison, the navigator used logarithmic tables and slide rules to solve the super-complex orbital mechanics.

He couldn't run many tests to evaluate his work, hence why the group huddled around the mathematician now to show their support.

Everyone knew his calculations were fiendishly hard. It took dozens of other mathematicians hundreds of days to just calculate his equations which included everything from weather conditions, ship weight, fuel expenditure, even the earth's rotation. Each factor was crucial to know the exact path that would carry the first human beyond Earth's atmosphere, and crucially, return him safely to Earth.

Short after being recruited to the space agency, his wife Anya called him obsessed. Lovingly, of course. "You hold your slide rule like a mother holds a newborn". Because it was top-secret, she knew nothing about his work. She didn't need to. Like her research at the hospital, he was just another person building a better future through the immense powers of science.

Now, the rocket began to emit a low, rising rumble. Vibrations soon traveled through the ground, up into Volkov's already shaking boots.

"Thirty seconds to launch," the speaker announced just loud enough to be heard over the rocket's roar. The room watched the launchpad as white-hot fire erupted from the mixture of fuel, steel, and mathematics that comprised the spaceship.

"Three, two, one". Liftoff!

Despite the intense light and noise, Volkov watched every microsecond. Rising hundreds of meters into the air, the flight followed its planned trajectory perfectly. As he watched his work disappear over the horizon, his feet finally stopped shaking. When the Kazakh prairie returned to its natural stillness, the entire room of turned their heads.

Everyone now stared at the monitors.

Each showed the flight's passengers: a mannequin named Ivan Ivanovich, a dog named Zvezdochka, frogs, monkeys, mice, rats, plants, television cameras, and other scientific instruments.

Nobody knew what leaving earth's gravity, atmosphere, and magnetosphere would do to lifeforms. But if enough passengers survived, the Korabl-Sputnik 5 flight test would be the last before a human tried it. Yuri Gagarin was everyone's favorite to be that hero—a farm boy turned cosmonaut who would follow Volkov's navigation into space!

As all the indicators showed success, Volkov allowed his mind to abandon the incessant logic orbital mathematics requires, and run wild into childish fantasy.

His grandparents never even traveled out of their town. Now he dreamed of stepping on the Moon. With its endless sunshine and untapped minerals, it was the stepping stone from which he and his colleagues would expand life beyond Earth and into the solar system.

The test flight started to orbit the Earth. All the creatures were living and breathing in the alien environment. Volkov could not help but smile and express his dreams to the room, "To the Moon!"

The period between navigating the oceans with wind and sails to flying in space is an immensely long time. Not when measured in years, because it was only a few centuries, but when measured in capabilities.

Moving so many squares in the game of life required giant evolutionary leaps. These jumps were only possible if we decoded the fundamental rules of nature more precisely than ever before.

Moving from philosophical contemplation to scientific precision, was quite hard to unlock. Just For our Volkov to gain the abilities he needed, there was riddle, with three big truths to overturn.

- The Earth was the center of the Universe.
- Any celestial object moves in perfect circles. 
- The rules that control the stars and Earthlings are fundamentally different.

Aristotle's and Ptolemy's system put these ideas in place. People went with it for over a thousand years because it worked pretty well. That's why Catholic religious leaders, mainly St. Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) married it with their faith, for, among other reasons, to ensure the timing of ceremonies depending lunar cycles and solar year, like Easter, was accurate.

This wedding of faith and astronomy made questioning this worldview all the harder.

Regardless of their wide adoption, the star charts developed using this geo-centric system were only accurate for a few centuries. Their predicted planet locations would be off by about four times the width of the Moon as seen from Earth. These inaccuracies were an inconvenient truth people were happy to ignore. After all, with minor adjustments, the system remained functional for generations.

But, as time passed, an increasing back log of mistakes gave inquisitive minds reason to ask questions. This especially happened in the Renaissance, when ancient thinkers were re-introduced into Italy, France, and other parts of Europe wanting to use the Socratic method to leave their relative backwardness in the Middle Ages behind them.

In this environment, Nicholas Copernicus (1473-1543) offered a weird idea. Perhaps the Earth was just another planet, and all planets revolved around the Sun. He was actually inspired by the work of Aristarchus of Samos, an ancient Greek who developed a Sun centric astronomy 2000 years prior.

Copernicus worked on his radical idea for 40 years. So reluctant was he to release his work, he only saw the published book on his death bed. Even so, "On the Revolution of Heavenly Spheres" caused such a stir it's why we think "revolution" means political turmoil.

Thereby one of the pillars of Aristotle Ptolemy system began to fall. Copernicus had proposed more than an idea. His book gave permission to question problems. Gone was the automatic reliance on settling disputes or explaining observations by relying on authority's of the past, in church, hierarchy, or thinkers like Aristotle.

Because of Copernicus, each person could decide for themselves, and thus had reconcile their beliefs with their observations in the real world. This was especially needed because with Johannes Gutenberg's moveable type printing press (1450) book publishing was dramatically sped up. Now many people's ideas and observations, in astronomy and physics, but also in medicine, chemistry, and other fields too, were spreading far and wide.

The riddle was up against a deluge of thoughts, ideas, and observations.

One of the biggest challenges was raised by Tycho Brahe (1546-1601). He was an astronomer working before the telescope who invented a way to keep remarkable accurate astronomical observations. His tried to combine Ptolemy with Copernicus with no success.

His assistant Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) knew better. With his great mathematical mind, he analyzed Tycho's data and realized that the planets orbited the Sun not in perfect circles, but in ovals called ellipses. He thus derived what became Kepler's laws of planetary motion.

And, these laws worked!

Celestial objects did not move in perfect circles. Thereafter, the second pillar of the riddle was gone. Once Copernicus Sun-centric model astronomy was modified to move in elliptical orbits, our astronomical predictions and stellar observations were perfectly in sync.

But no one knew why yet. Meaning we could observe and predict the natural laws but didn't understand what force drove them.

Whilst people battled it out over publications and conferences, there was much progress being made using all these improvements. For one, in 1582 the Julian calendar was updated into the Gregorian calender we used today, and that is accurate for the next 4,000 years.

Galileo (1564-1642) also made a monumental contribution by inventing the telescope. He pointed it up at space and saw for himself the planets had moons, Venus had phases, neither of which would be possible if the Earth was the center of the Universe. Since seeing is believing the telescopes increasingly powerful viewport into the cosmos made it became it easier for people to investigate and accept new ideas.

Still, without knowing why the heavens moved, our questions would never have a natural foundation, leaving us to clash in endless debates. Gladly, the question was decided so convincingly that it would start the Science Age.

Because Isaac Newton (1643-1727) came along. Among many other landmark achievements, he invented a new math called calculus to explain Kepler's laws. Newton could now show how something called universal gravitation moved the planets as well as falling apples on Earth. Meaning the physics of the "the heavens" and Earth in fact have the same natural laws.

The final piece of the riddle Aristotle Ptolemy system present to us had fallen. Thus, Newton was able to write the laws of motion:

1. A body remains at rest, or in motion at a constant speed in a straight line, unless it is acted upon by a force.
2. At any instant of time, the net force on a body is equal to the body's acceleration multiplied by its mass or, equivalently, the rate at which the body's momentum is changing with time.
3. If two bodies exert forces on each other, these forces have the same magnitude but opposite directions.

Of course the math behind all these statement fills volumes. Yet, for our purpose, the evolutionary jumps needed for to create the orbital dynamics needed for spaceflight navigation were completed.

We still needed to complete much work. The technological jumps needed to build the space ships not to mention the calculators and computers needed complete the daunting calculations, took centuries. Regardless, the space navigators in the Moon race used Newton's math and not much else because uncovering natural laws requires no occasional updates, rationalizations, or inconvenient truths.

That is the power of scientific understanding. Since it's natural it's repeatable across time and space and only gets more accurate with time in a way mythological stories and philosophical understanding cannot not. That's why NASA is often apt to say "we put Isaac Newton in the driver's seat".

Using Newton as the examples, the Science Age proceeded to unlock many more rules of the game. Medicine, anatomy, and so many other fields advanced by leaps in bounds because of scientific instruments and thinking.

Regardless, despite all its power, science is not the lone destination in the game of life.

This is for the same reason lifeforms largely do not compete but cooperate. The three modes of human understanding that the took Polynesians to distant islands, Roman cargo ships to Mediterranean ports, and spaceships throughout the solar system, are co-dependant. For a healthy technological ecosystem to form they must co-exist.

We can showcase this best when looking at the perilous manned space missions to the Moon.

_The gods did not reveal, from the beginning, all things to us, but in the course of time through seeking we may learn & know things better. But as for certain truth no man knows it, nor shall he know it, neither of the gods nor yet of all things that I speak. For even if by chance he were to utter The Final Truth, he would himself not know it: for all is but a woven web of guesses._

Xenophanes, Greek Historian, 6th Century BC.




Navigation is always hard. Trying to get to a place requires knowing how much energy you need to get there. When to leave, where to aim, how to stop, and also how to get back.

For many years open ocean navigation was the ultimate test of navigation. Most biological creatures cannot do it, and neither could humans. Polynesians were the earliest ones to master it. They used mythologies to remember details of the celestial happenings. As time went on, voyagers in the around China, India, and Mediterranean would used star charts from philosophical deductions of astronomy.

Eventually, we developed the telescope. This allowed quite accurate star charts. With the sextant, a doubly reflecting navigation instrument that measures the angular distance between two visible objects, navigators could locate their latitude and longitude anywhere on Earth.

This brought on the Age of Sail. A time where ships could travel anywhere in the world. International trade, war, settlements, colonies, were all possible in a way never seen before.





For centuries, humans played the game of navigation and exploration using increasingly complex tools—from star charts to maritime engineering. But the ultimate game board was not just the Earth's surface, but the vast expanse of space itself. As civilizations learned to master terrestrial navigation, a new frontier beckoned—one that would require an entirely new set of skills to understand and overcome the fundamental laws of motion and gravity.

The heliocentric revolution emerged through the collaborative efforts of three groundbreaking astronomers. Nicolaus Copernicus first proposed the radical idea that the Sun, not Earth, was the center of the solar system in his 1543 work "De revolutionibus orbium coelestium." This challenged the long-held Ptolemaic geocentric model, suggesting planets, including Earth, orbited around the Sun.

Johannes Kepler refined this model mathematically, developing three fundamental laws of planetary motion. He demonstrated that planets move in elliptical orbits, not perfect circles, and established precise mathematical relationships between a planet's orbital period and its distance from the Sun. His work provided the mathematical foundation that transformed the heliocentric model from a theoretical concept to a scientifically rigorous system.

Galileo Galilei delivered the crucial observational evidence. Using improved telescopes, he observed Jupiter's moons, Venus's phases, and other celestial phenomena that directly supported the Copernican model. His observations provided empirical proof that not everything revolved around Earth, fundamentally challenging the existing astronomical understanding and supporting the heliocentric theory.

This Scientific Revolution culminated in the works of Isaac Newton.

Isaac Newton revolutionized scientific understanding by formulating the three laws of motion and the universal law of gravitation. His work unified terrestrial and celestial mechanics, demonstrating that the same physical laws govern both a falling apple and planetary orbits. By introducing calculus and providing precise mathematical models, Newton transformed scientific inquiry from philosophical speculation to a rigorous, predictive discipline that could explain complex physical interactions.

And without exaggeration, it was Newton's laws used to travel to the Moon.

NASA used Newton's laws of motion and universal gravitation as the fundamental mathematical framework for lunar mission trajectory calculations. The first law (objects in motion remain in motion unless acted upon by an external force) allowed precise prediction of spacecraft movement. The second law (force equals mass times acceleration) enabled engineers to calculate rocket thrust and fuel requirements. The third law (every action has an equal and opposite reaction) was crucial for understanding propulsion mechanics.

By applying these laws, NASA could:
1. Calculate exact spacecraft trajectories
2. Determine fuel consumption
3. Plan orbital insertions and lunar landings
4. Predict gravitational interactions between celestial bodies
5. Design precise mid-course corrections

Newton's equations allowed mission planners to create complex mathematical models that predicted spacecraft movement with remarkable accuracy, essentially "solving" the path to the Moon through mathematical precision.




 - no superior stage. Note Apollo 13 use of manual flying, or Apollo 8's use of star charts for re-orientation. never mind the failed SU, despite science, or string theory.
 - note, what the three, storytelling, philosophy, science, are an ecosystem, and like biological ones, each has a place in healthy one.
- crucially, life is cooperation because the game board isn't stagnant. entropy dissolves the game squares behind us, so we must evolve, in a race against time.... we may outrun our neighbors, but that means little to entropys wrath...











If you were on the planet Earth around 4.5 billion years ago, the scene was very different from today. The solar system was still forming. The orbits of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune had not settled. The Sun was significantly less luminous, shining at about 30% of its current brightness.

Then Earth was hit by a Mars-sized object called Theia. This massive collision increased the planet's mass, melted our core, and (many scientists think) created the Moon from the resulting debris. Thereafter, the Late Heavy Bombardment rained countless meteorites and created the distinctive cratered landscapes we can still observe on the Moon and Earth. 

Thereafter Earth was molten ball of rock and metal, with a thin crust of solidified rock and metals in tectonic plates wracked by intense volcanic activity with a thick atmosphere of noxious gases. 

This was so long ago, how can we know all this?

Because even though Earth was very different back then, the laws of physics, chemistry, geology were exactly the same. So we can know all this because we just use these rules of the game to look backward. Learning how we do this, will empower us to look forward and better see our future.

In our quest to understand the Earth as the game board of evolution, we must start with understanding physics. It is the starting point because it controls what happens at the atomic level inside the particles of a rose or hammer, and at the cosmic level between stars, planets, and even galaxies.

We've already learned about the several Ancient Greek philosophers who kick started scientific inquiry against the deluge of mythological stories. However, it wasn't until Aristotle that someone put together a comprehensive understanding of physics.

Aristotle relied heavily on human senses and brain because he had only had simple tools like sundials and water clocks to make observations and measurements. Thus, his system was based on a qualitative approach that sought to understand the natural world through observation and logical reasoning. 

Aristotle's physics centered on four elements: earth, air, fire, and water. He believed objects move to their natural place based on elemental composition—heavy elements falling down, light elements rising up. A fifth element, "ether," explained the celestial realm's perfect, unchanging nature. This theory systematically interpreted physical motion and universal structure through elemental principles.

Aristotle's astronomical understanding proposed a geocentric universe where Earth sat motionless at the center, surrounded by concentric celestial spheres. These perfect, crystalline spheres carried celestial bodies in circular motion, reflecting what Aristotle considered the most perfect geometric shape.

According to his model, the universe consisted of two fundamental regions: the terrestrial (imperfect, changeable) and the celestial (perfect, unchanging). He believed heavenly bodies were made of a fifth element called "aether," fundamentally different from earthly matter. Aristotle argued that planets, the sun, and stars were embedded in transparent, rotating spheres that moved in perfect circular paths around Earth.

While scientifically incorrect, Aristotle's model was philosophically sophisticated for its time. 

However crucially, it was a concerted effort that was, if impressive in its scope and internally consistent logic. And the Greeks got many other things correct. Mainly the ability to question human beliefs when looking out into the world looking for answers.

While often criticized for some incorrect theories, Greek thinkers, including Aristotle, systematized observational approaches to natural philosophy. One could build on their work using their methods.

Overall, these thinkers from ancient Greece to Islamic scholars laid countless bricks in the building of natural philosophy. They followed Aristotle's drive to know the natural laws. But they were limited in the abilities simply because they didn't have the tools to experience these laws outside of human experience, logical reasoning, and the use of simple scientific instruments to make their discoveries. 

And then toolmaking changed. 

In the new kilns of northern Italy humanity could burn over 500 degrees, and thereby make glass clearer than ever before. And as contemporary Greek scholars reintroduced Europe to their ancestors works the Renaissance was born when the telescope and soon the microscope pierced through human narratives by extending our sense to new phenomena.

Spanning roughly from the 14th to 17th centuries, it a profound cultural rebirth that originated in Florence and spread throughout Italy and Europe. This period marked a transition from medieval to modern thinking, characterized by a renewed interest in classical learning, humanism, and individual potential.

Soon the Age of Science was to begin.

Because Francis Bacon pioneered the scientific method, advocating for empirical observation and experimental evidence over philosophical speculation. He championed inductive reasoning and systematic research, transforming scientific inquiry by emphasizing direct evidence and repeatable experiments, ultimately becoming the father of modern scientific methodology.

The ideals of Aristotle and his compatriots were formalized. Natural philosophers were replaced by scientists, and for us here talking about physics, physicists became a new identity for anyone wanting to understand the physical world.

SooThese scientists represented a transformative period in human understanding, breaking away from medieval thinking and establishing the foundations of modern scientific methodology. Isaac Newton stands out as perhaps the most influential, essentially creating the framework of classical physics and mathematical analysis that would dominate scientific thought for centuries. Galileo Galilei was crucial in challenging existing scientific paradigms, using empirical observation to support the Copernican heliocentric model, which fundamentally changed humanity's understanding of our place in the universe.

- Isaac Newton	Developed laws of motion, universal gravitation, calculus, fundamental principles of classical mechanics
- Galileo Galilei	Improved telescope, discovered Jupiter's moons, championed heliocentric model, fundamental observational astronomy
- Johannes Kepler	Formulated laws of planetary motion, bridged astronomical observation with mathematical precision
- René Descartes	Analytical geometry, philosophical approach to scientific reasoning, coordinate system development
- Blaise Pascal	Probability theory, hydraulics, philosophical mathematics, early computing concepts	Mathematics

Johannes Kepler bridged observational astronomy with mathematical precision, developing laws of planetary motion that were revolutionary for their time. René Descartes and Blaise Pascal contributed immensely to mathematical thinking, with Descartes creating analytical geometry and Pascal making significant advances in probability and philosophical reasoning.

These scientists shared a common approach: challenging existing knowledge through observation, mathematical analysis, and rigorous experimental methods. They transformed scientific inquiry from a philosophical and speculative endeavor to a systematic, empirical discipline.

This series of discoveries continued until the modern day. 

- James Clerk Maxwell	Unified electricity and magnetism, developed electromagnetic theory
- Albert Einstein	Theory of relativity (special and general), quantum mechanics, E=mc² equation, photoelectric effect
- Niels Bohr	Atomic model, quantum mechanics, quantum theory of atomic structure
- Marie Curie	Pioneering research on radioactivity, discovered polonium and radium, first woman to win Nobel Prize
- Max Planck	Quantum theory, black body radiation, Planck constant
- Werner Heisenberg	Uncertainty principle, matrix mechanics, quantum mechanics

All these advances revolutionized navigation. These scientific frameworks enabled precise celestial mapping, trajectory calculations, and gravitational corrections. From maritime navigation to GPS and space exploration, these theories allow humans to calculate positions with extraordinary accuracy across Earth and space.

And thus we come to the end of our history overview of the history of physics. We started in ancient Greece where humans first sought to uncover natural laws in place of mythological stories to explain the universe. The Romans built and spread the work of Greek philosophers, whose work continued inside if Islamic civilization for centuries.

As the Renaissance return Greek philosophy to Europe, it mixed with toolmaking advanced enough to make instruments like the telescope and microscope that gave us new vantage points. We more experiences, natural philosophers became scientists. The human mastery exploded.

Because of them we can know the immutable laws of physics:

**The Laws Of Motion**

Newton's three laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation revolutionized our understanding of the physical world. The laws of inertia, acceleration, and action-reaction, along with the inverse-square relationship of gravitational force, provided a unified framework for describing the motions of objects on Earth and in the heavens. These groundbreaking insights laid the foundation for our modern scientific understanding and enabled further advancements in physics and astronomy.

The law of conservation of energy is a fundamental principle in physics that states energy can neither be created nor destroyed, but rather can only be transformed or transferred from one form to another. This means the total amount of energy in an isolated system remains constant over time, even as energy is converted between different forms, such as kinetic, potential, thermal, or electrical energy. Energy can be transferred between objects or systems, but the total energy remains the same. This law applies to all physical and chemical processes in the universe, from the motion of planets to the workings of electrical devices. It is a cornerstone of modern physics and has enabled the development of countless technologies that harness and manipulate energy in various ways.

The law of conservation of momentum is a fundamental principle in physics which states that the total momentum of a closed system remains constant unless an external force acts upon it. Momentum is defined as the product of an object's mass and its velocity. In a closed system, where no external forces are present, the total momentum before an interaction or collision is exactly equal to the total momentum after the interaction. This means that momentum can be transferred between objects, but the total momentum of the system remains the same. This law applies to all types of collisions, from subatomic particle interactions to the motion of large celestial bodies. It is a crucial concept for understanding the dynamics of physical systems and has numerous applications in fields like engineering, astrophysics, and quantum mechanics.

The law of gravity, also known as the universal law of gravitation, is a fundamental principle that describes the attractive force between any two objects with mass. Formulated by Sir Isaac Newton in the 17th century, the law states that the force of gravity between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This means that the greater the mass of the objects and the closer they are to each other, the stronger the gravitational force will be. The law of gravity explains a wide range of phenomena, from the motion of planets and stars to the behavior of objects falling on Earth. It is a cornerstone of classical mechanics and has been extensively tested and verified through numerous scientific observations and experiments over the centuries.

**The Laws Of Thermodynamics**

The laws of thermodynamics are a set of fundamental principles that describe how energy behaves in the physical world. 

The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can be transformed from one form to another, but it cannot be created or destroyed. For example, when you burn a piece of wood, the chemical energy stored in the wood is converted into heat and light energy. The total amount of energy remains the same, it is just changed form.

The second law of thermodynamics says that the natural tendency of things is to become more disordered over time. A messy room, for instance, will naturally become more cluttered and disorganized unless you actively work to keep it clean and tidy. Similarly, heat naturally flows from hot objects to cooler ones, rather than the other way around, unless you use an external force like a refrigerator.

The third law of thermodynamics states that as a system approaches absolute zero temperature, its entropy (disorder) approaches a minimum, usually zero. This means that at the coldest possible temperature, a perfect crystal would have no disorder in its atomic structure. While we can't actually reach absolute zero, this law helps explain phenomena like superconductivity that occur at extremely low temperatures.

**The Laws Of Electromagnetism**

The laws of electromagnetism describe the fundamental relationships between electric and magnetic fields, and how they interact with matter. These laws were developed primarily through the pioneering work of scientists like Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell in the 19th century.

The first key law is Coulomb's law, which states that the force between two electric charges is proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This is similar to the law of gravity, and explains phenomena like the attraction between opposite charges and the repulsion between like charges. Magnets, with their north and south poles, shows the principles of electromagnetism.

Another important law is Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, which says that a changing magnetic field will induce an electric current in a nearby conductor. This is the basis for how electric generators and transformers work—the spinning of a magnet in a coil of wire induces a flow of electrons, generating electricity.

Maxwell's equations then unified the previously separate laws of electricity and magnetism, showing that they are two aspects of the same electromagnetic field. These equations describe how electric and magnetic fields are created and how they propagate through space in the form of electromagnetic waves, like visible light, radio waves, and X-rays.

The laws of electromagnetism have enabled the development of countless technologies we rely on today, from power grids and telecommunications to MRI scanners and GPS. They explain phenomena ranging from the Northern Lights to the operation of electric motors. Understanding these fundamental principles has been crucial to our scientific understanding of the physical world.

**The Laws of Relativity**

The laws of relativity, developed by Albert Einstein, represent a revolutionary shift in our understanding of the physical universe. At the core are two key principles:

* The Principle of Relativity—the laws of physics are the same in all non-accelerating frames of reference. There is no absolute or preferred frame.
* The Constancy of the Speed of Light—the speed of light in a vacuum is always constant, regardless of the motion of the light source or observer.

From these principles, Einstein derived his theories of special and general relativity. Special relativity showed that space and time are relative, with moving clocks running slower and objects contracting. General relativity described gravity as the curvature of space-time caused by mass and energy. The practical benefits of Einstein's groundbreaking work are numerous. His theories enabled the development of technologies like GPS, which relies on the principles of relativity to accurately determine position and time. Relativity also underlies our modern understanding of black holes, neutron stars, and the evolution of the universe as a whole. Furthermore, Einstein's insights paved the way for the revolution in quantum mechanics, which has transformed fields from computing to materials science.

**The Laws Of Quantum Mechanics**

In the realm of quantum mechanics, the laws of physics take on a different form, as they must account for the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales. The principles of quantum mechanics, such as the uncertainty principle and the wave-particle duality, have revolutionized our understanding of the subatomic world and have led to the development of technologies like quantum computing and quantum cryptography.

### The Laws of Chemistry 

The origins of chemistry can be traced back to the ancient world, where philosophers and alchemists began to explore the nature of matter and the transformations it undergoes. In the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, and India, early practitioners conducted experiments and observations, laying the groundwork for the eventual emergence of chemistry as a distinct scientific discipline. These early experiments often relied on simple tools and apparatus, such as crucibles, retorts, and distillation equipment.

One of the earliest known figures in the history of chemistry is the Egyptian priest and scholar Thoth, who is believed to have lived around 3000 BC. Thoth is credited with the development of the first known chemical processes, including the extraction of metals from ores and the production of various dyes and pigments. The ancient Egyptians also made significant advancements in the fields of metallurgy, glassmaking, and the preservation of mummified remains, all of which required a basic understanding of chemical principles and the use of specialized equipment like furnaces and kilns.

In ancient Greece, the philosopher Aristotle (384-322 BC) proposed a theory of the four elements—earth, air, fire, and water—which he believed were the fundamental building blocks of the physical world. While Aristotle's model was largely qualitative and lacked the rigor of modern chemistry, it represented an important step in the conceptual development of the field. Largely because of Aristotle's work, people knew there was something deeper in the nature of matter to discover.

The medieval period saw the rise of alchemy, a precursor to modern chemistry that focused on the transformation of base metals into gold or silver. Alchemists such as Jabir ibn Hayyan (also known as Geber) in the 8th century and Roger Bacon in the 13th century made significant contributions to the understanding of chemical processes, including the development of new laboratory techniques and the discovery of various chemical compounds. They utilized a range of specialized equipment, such as alembics, retorts, and furnaces, to conduct their experiments.

During the Renaissance, the work of alchemists and natural philosophers began to transition towards a more systematic and scientific approach to the study of matter. Figures like Paracelsus (1493-1541) and Robert Boyle (1627-1691) challenged the prevailing Aristotelian model and introduced new concepts, such as the distinction between elements and compounds, and the idea of chemical reactions as the rearrangement of fundamental particles. They also made use of more advanced laboratory equipment, including the balance, thermometer, and the air pump, which allowed for more precise measurements and observations.

The 18th and 19th centuries saw a rapid acceleration in the development of chemistry as a scientific discipline. Landmark achievements include the identification of the chemical elements by Antoine Lavoisier, the development of the periodic table by Dmitri Mendeleev, and the formulation of the atomic theory by John Dalton. These advancements, along with the work of chemists like Michael Faraday, Friedrich Wöhler, and Louis Pasteur, laid the foundation for the modern understanding of the structure and behavior of matter. The increasing sophistication of scientific instruments, such as the spectroscope, the microscope, and the calorimeter, played a crucial role in these discoveries.

In the 20th century, the field of chemistry continued to evolve, with the emergence of quantum mechanics, the discovery of new elements, and the development of sophisticated analytical techniques. The work of scientists like Linus Pauling, Marie Curie, and Fritz Haber has had a profound impact on our understanding of chemical bonding, radioactivity, and the synthesis of new materials. The advancement of instrumentation, including X-ray crystallography, mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, has been instrumental in the progress of modern chemistry.

Today, chemistry remains a vibrant and rapidly advancing field, with applications spanning a wide range of disciplines, from materials science and biotechnology to environmental science and nanotechnology. The ongoing exploration of the fundamental nature of matter and the search for new chemical compounds and reactions continue to drive the progress of this essential scientific field, aided by the continuous development of sophisticated analytical tools and experimental techniques.

---

Just as physics is governed by a set of fundamental principles, chemistry also has a number of core laws that describe the behavior and interactions of matter at the atomic and molecular scale. These laws, which have been developed and refined over centuries of scientific investigation, provide a framework for understanding the composition, structure, and transformations of substances.

**The Law of Conservation of Mass**

The law of conservation of mass, first formulated by the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier in the 18th century, states that the total mass of the reactants in a chemical reaction is equal to the total mass of the products. This means that matter can neither be created nor destroyed during a chemical process; it can only be transformed from one form to another. This law is a cornerstone of chemistry, as it underpins our understanding of chemical reactions and the fundamental principles of stoichiometry. The practical benefits of this law include the ability to accurately predict the outcomes of chemical processes, design efficient industrial and manufacturing processes, and develop sustainable waste management strategies.

**The Law of Definite Proportions**

Also known as Proust's law, the law of definite proportions states that a chemical compound always contains the same elements combined in the same fixed proportions by mass, regardless of the source or method of preparation. This means that the composition of a pure chemical compound is constant and unique, a concept that was crucial in the development of the modern atomic theory and the identification of chemical elements. The practical applications of this law include the ability to reliably identify and characterize chemical substances, develop standardized manufacturing processes, and ensure the quality and purity of pharmaceutical and industrial products.

**The Law of Multiple Proportions**

Proposed by the English chemist John Dalton in the early 19th century, the law of multiple proportions states that when two elements form more than one compound, the masses of one element that combine with a fixed mass of the other element are in a ratio of small whole numbers. This law helped Dalton formulate his atomic theory and provided further evidence for the discrete and quantized nature of matter. The practical benefits of this law include the ability to predict the formation of different chemical compounds, understand the principles of chemical bonding, and design targeted synthesis strategies for the production of specific materials and molecules.

**The Periodic Law**

The periodic law, developed by the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev in the 1860s, states that the physical and chemical properties of the elements vary periodically with their atomic number (the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom). This led to the creation of the periodic table, a powerful organizational tool that arranges the elements based on their atomic structure and predicts the behavior of unknown elements, revolutionizing the field of chemistry. The practical applications of the periodic law include the ability to predict the properties and reactivity of elements, design new materials with desired characteristics, and guide the development of new chemical processes and technologies.

**The Ideal Gas Law**

The ideal gas law, a combination of several earlier gas laws, describes the relationship between the pressure, volume, amount, and absolute temperature of an ideal gas. This law, formulated by the combined work of scientists like Robert Boyle, Charles' law, and Avogadro's law, provides a framework for understanding the behavior of gases and has numerous applications in chemistry, physics, and engineering. The practical benefits of the ideal gas law include the ability to design and optimize processes involving gases, such as in the petrochemical industry, the development of refrigeration and air conditioning systems, and the understanding of atmospheric phenomena.

**The Laws of Thermodynamics**

While the laws of thermodynamics were discussed in the physics section, it is important to note that these fundamental principles also have a profound impact on the field of chemistry. The first law, which states that energy can be transformed but not created or destroyed, is crucial for understanding chemical reactions and the energy changes involved. The second law, which describes the tendency towards increased disorder or entropy, helps explain the spontaneity and directionality of chemical processes. The practical applications of these laws include the ability to predict the feasibility and efficiency of chemical reactions, design energy-efficient industrial processes, and develop new materials and technologies that harness the principles of thermodynamics.

These laws of chemistry, along with the continued development of more specialized theories and principles, have been instrumental in our understanding of the composition, structure, and behavior of matter at the atomic and molecular level. They have enabled the advancement of countless applications, from the development of new materials and pharmaceuticals to the study of complex biological systems, and have been crucial to our scientific understanding of the world around us.

### The Laws of Geography

The origins of geology can be traced back to the ancient world, where philosophers and natural historians began to observe and study the Earth's physical features, minerals, and fossils. In civilizations such as ancient Greece, China, and the Middle East, early practitioners made important observations and developed rudimentary theories about the formation and composition of the planet.

One of the earliest known figures in the history of geology is the Greek philosopher Aristotle (384-322 BC), who proposed a theory of the Earth's structure, including the idea of a molten interior. Another influential ancient thinker was the Chinese philosopher Bian Que, who in the 4th century BC recognized the importance of fossils in understanding the Earth's history.

Nearby, Eratosthenes was measuring the world itself, calculating the Earth's circumference with a precision that seemed almost magical, his maps revealing a planet more complex and interconnected than anyone had previously conceived.

During the Middle Ages, the study of the Earth's features and materials continued, with scholars such as Avicenna (980-1037 AD) in the Islamic world and Albertus Magnus (1193-1280 AD) in Europe making contributions to the understanding of minerals, rocks, and geological processes.

The Renaissance period saw a significant advancement in the field of geology, with the work of scholars like Georgius Agricola (1494-1555), who wrote extensively on mining and metallurgy, and Nicolaus Steno (1638-1686), who made important observations about the formation of rock layers and the nature of fossils.

The 18th and 19th centuries marked a turning point in the development of geology as a scientific discipline. Landmark achievements include the work of James Hutton (1726-1797), who proposed the concept of "deep time" and the idea of the Earth's gradual transformation over vast timescales, and Charles Lyell (1797-1875), who established the principles of uniformitarianism, which helped to explain the Earth's geological history.

The advancement of geological knowledge was closely tied to the development of new scientific instruments and techniques. Early geologists relied on simple tools such as hammers, compasses, and magnifying glasses to study rock formations and collect samples. However, as the field progressed, more sophisticated instruments were introduced, including the microscope, which allowed for the detailed analysis of mineral and rock compositions, and theodolite, which enabled more precise surveying and mapping of geological features.

In the 20th century, the field of geology continued to evolve, with the emergence of plate tectonics theory, the discovery of radiometric dating techniques, and the development of advanced analytical methods such as X-ray diffraction and seismic imaging. These advancements, along with the work of scientists like Alfred Wegener, Arthur Holmes, and Marie Tharp, have significantly expanded our understanding of the Earth's structure, composition, and dynamic processes.

Today, geology remains a vital and multifaceted scientific field, with applications ranging from the exploration and extraction of natural resources to the study of natural hazards, climate change, and the evolution of life on Earth. Geologists continue to utilize a wide range of sophisticated instruments and techniques, including remote sensing, geophysical surveys, and computer modeling, to unravel the complex history and ongoing changes of our planet.

---

The fundamental laws and principles of geology provide the conceptual framework for interpreting the Earth's history and dynamics. These principles, ranging from uniformitarianism to faunal succession, allow geologists to decipher the geological record, predict natural events, and develop strategies for sustainable resource management and environmental protection. These laws are the cornerstones of the geological sciences, guiding our understanding of the dynamic, ever-changing planet we inhabit.

**Uniformitarianism**

The principle of uniformitarianism, established by James Hutton and Charles Lyell, states that the geological processes and forces that shape the Earth's surface and interior have operated in a similar manner throughout Earth's history. This implies that the same physical, chemical, and biological laws and processes that operate today also operated in the past. This principle allows geologists to use present-day observations and measurements to interpret the geological past, providing a framework for understanding the Earth's history.

**Superposition**

The principle of superposition states that in an undeformed sequence of sedimentary or volcanic rock layers, the older layers will be found at the bottom, and the younger layers will be found at the top. This principle provides a basic framework for establishing the relative age of rock formations, enabling geologists to determine the order in which geological events occurred.

**Original Horizontality**

The principle of original horizontality states that sedimentary rock layers are originally deposited in a horizontal or nearly horizontal position. Deviations from the horizontal position indicate that the rock layers have been subsequently deformed or tilted by geological processes, providing valuable information about the Earth's tectonic history.

**Cross-Cutting Relationships**

The principle of cross-cutting relationships states that a geological feature (such as a fault, intrusion, or unconformity) that cuts across or disrupts another feature is younger than the feature it cuts. This principle allows geologists to determine the relative timing of geological events and establish the sequence of processes that have shaped the Earth's surface and interior.

**Inclusions and Unconformities**

The principle of inclusions and unconformities states that rock fragments or fossils found within a rock formation must be older than the rock formation itself. Unconformities, which represent gaps in the geological record, provide information about periods of erosion or non-deposition, further enhancing our understanding of the Earth's history.

**Lateral Continuity**

The principle of lateral continuity states that sedimentary rock layers extend laterally in all directions, unless there is evidence of erosion or non-deposition. This principle allows geologists to correlate and match rock layers across different locations, enabling them to reconstruct the geological history of a region.

**Faunal Succession**

The principle of faunal succession states that fossil organisms appear, flourish, and then become extinct in a specific order. This principle provides a framework for relative dating and correlation of rock layers based on their fossil content, contributing to our understanding of the evolution of life on Earth.

These fundamental principles, along with the development of radiometric dating techniques and other advanced analytical methods, have been instrumental in the advancement of geology as a scientific discipline. They provide the conceptual foundation for interpreting the Earth's geological history, understanding the processes that shape the planet, and making predictions about future geological events and changes.

### The Laws of Nature

Human understanding the laws of physics, chemistry, and geology did not emerge fully formed, but rather have been slowly uncovered and refined over centuries of scientific inquiry. As human understanding and technological capabilities have advanced, we have been able to uncover the underlying patterns and principles that govern the physical world with ever-greater precision. Early philosophers and natural scientists used simple tools like sundials and water clocks to make observations and develop initial theories, which were then built upon and tested through increasingly sophisticated experimentation. The improvements of metal working and glassmaking enabled the invention of telescopes, microscopes, and other advanced instruments which allowed scientists to peer deeper into the realms of the very large and the very small, revealing new phenomena that challenged and expanded existing models.

As each generation of scientists has tested and refined these laws through rigorous observation and analysis, the bedrock of our scientific understanding of the universe has grown ever stronger. Today, the laws of physics form the foundation that enables us to make accurate predictions, design transformative technologies, and explore the frontiers of human knowledge—from the vast expanses of astrophysics to the nanoscale realm of quantum mechanics. This steady progression, driven by both human ingenuity and technological progress, has paved the way for the groundbreaking discoveries that continue to shape our understanding of the physical world.

### The Game Board Called Earth as Made by Physics, Chemistry, and Geology

So, what does this all mean? The laws of nature are eternal. We are not. To live in their world, we must understand the laws will never change because we asked, demanded, passed laws, wrote stories, or marched around. The laws of nature are a unthinking rules. And they created the planet and universe in which we live.

In essenece, the laws of nature created the gameboard life must survive on to keep playing and stay alive.

Approximately 4.6 billion years ago, the Earth was a vastly different world, still in the throes of its formative stages. Emerging from the swirling cloud of gas and dust that gave birth to our solar system, the young planet was a testament to the raw power of the forces that had shaped its creation.

At the heart of this primordial world was the ever-present force of gravity, the celestial glue that bound the cosmos together. It was gravity's relentless pull, exerted by the Earth itself and the nearby Sun, that had coalesced the scattered elements into a solid, spherical body, molding the contours of its surface and the ebb and flow of its mighty oceans.

These primordial seas were no gentle, lapping tides, but rather a tumultuous, roiling expanse, driven by powerful currents coursing through the depths. Imagine standing on the shores of these ancient waters, gazing out upon a horizon that stretched as far as the eye could see, unbroken by the gentle sway of waves or the silhouettes of distant islands. The very ground beneath your feet would have trembled with the force of the planet's internal turmoil, as the tectonic plates, driven by the convection of the mantle, collided and subducted, creating new mountain ranges and deep ocean basins.

The Earth was play play-doo in the hands of a tolddler. Squishing and shifting as the forces of physics molded it over and over.

The source of this geological upheaval was the Earth's own fiery core, a molten maelstrom fueled by the relentless process of radioactive decay. Deep within the planet's interior, this intense heat was constantly being pushed outward, sending plumes of scorching magma surging through the mantle and crust. It was this volcanic activity that gave birth to the towering mountains that dotted the young Earth's surface, their jagged peaks piercing the hazy atmosphere.

These were not the weathered, gentle giants we know today, but rather raw, primal expressions of the planet's raw power. The air would have been thick with the acrid stench of volcanic gases, and the skies rent by the thunderous roar of erupting volcanoes, their molten plumes casting an otherworldly glow over the entire scene.

And what of that atmosphere, that thin veil of gases that clung to the planet's surface, shielding it from the unforgiving void of space? Ah, but it was a far cry from the life-sustaining embrace we enjoy today. Nay, this was a noxious, choking miasma, composed primarily of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and water vapor, with virtually no oxygen to support complex life.

Imagine standing beneath this perpetual haze, the Sun's rays filtered through the thick, hazy atmosphere, casting the land in a dim, eerie glow. The skies above would have been a constant battleground, as the powerful atmospheric circulation patterns, driven by differences in temperature and pressure, created towering storms and violent winds that would have shaped the planet's surface.

Pre-life physical, chemical, and geological requirements were ready. The ooze of life was ready to use all these laws of elements and take its first form.

Yet, even in this harsh environment, the seeds of change were being sown. The intense ultraviolet radiation pouring down from the Sun, unfiltered by the sparse atmosphere, was catalyzing a myriad of complex chemical reactions in the primordial oceans. Amino acids, nucleic acids, and other organic compounds were beginning to coalesce and interact, setting the stage for the eventual emergence of the first primitive life forms.

Imagine the scene as these building blocks of life began to take shape, slowly but surely, in the churning waters of the ancient seas. The surface would have been a veritable battlefield, scarred by the relentless bombardment of meteorites and asteroids, the impacts of which would have shaken the very foundations of the planet.

Picture one of these celestial projectiles streaking through the hazy atmosphere, its fiery trail illuminating the sky before it slammed into the Earth's surface with a deafening roar. The impact would have sent shockwaves rippling through the ground, creating new mountains and valleys, and perhaps even triggering volcanic eruptions or tectonic shifts.

Despite the seemingly chaotic nature of this world, there was a certain order to the madness, a rhythm to the dance of the elements that would one day give rise to the intricate tapestry of life. For the forces that shaped the Earth, from the pull of gravity to the churning of the mantle, were all part of a delicate, interconnected system, each one playing a crucial role in the planet's transformation.

So, more than the laws of nature being the rule makers in the universe we want to live in. Physics controls chemistry, and physics and chemstry control geology. As the laws of nature increase from the finite to the more tangigle. The laws of nature also control the rules that make us, which brings us to the laws of biology.

### Summary

We are on a journey to truly understand our politics, econoimcs, and identities. A field of study these areas are still filled with mythologies and ideologies. We studied the laws of nature for two reasons. The first is the physics, chemistry, and geology govern how our planet exists, these are the laws we must adapt to, and thus the laws we much understand to better adapt. The second reason we studied the laws of nature is to understand how we came to understand these laws. Even though we've had big brains for many years, our information was limited by our biological senses. So, we created stories to understand the universe we lived in. These stories put ourselves at the center of things, physics thought the universe resolved around the sun. Chemistry thought the universe was composed of earth, water, air, and fire because those were the elements we could see, smell, taste, and touch. Geology thought hell was waiting in the depths, while heaven was above us in the perfect sky.

Slowly, as better technology evolved and more accurate scientific instruments were developed, our brains had new senses and therefore better data of the world around us. Slowly we replaced all our self-centered mythologies with the laws of nature.

Once science got going, it was self-sustaining. Because making accurate predictions sells itself against mythologies. However, that turning point from myth to science is dicey. It takes many years for there to be enough evidence for science to win the comparison making it all the harder for the many people who believe and benefit from the myth to let it go without a fight. 

And that's the point we are at with politics, whose self-described perfection is drawing strict believers and everyone else who can see through the cracks of mythology. For example, when a technological visonary makes a new rocket ship they make an argument against physics. When that same visionary makes a political argument, they use an ideology story to make his point.

Techvolution is about people discussing what's best for politics and economics, to also reference natural laws. So let us keeping learning how science came to physics, chemistry, geology, and biology so we're more ready to learn and accept the natural laws of politics. As we'll see. Life had to learn what the laws of nature were too. And the process started 3.6 billion years ago.

To be worked on.

1. How does the author plan to address the potential criticism that science is not always objective or value-free? The text implies that science is a more accurate and reliable way of understanding the world than mythology or ideology, but this assumption may be challenged by some readers.
2. What is the author's definition of "mythology" and "ideology"? These terms are used somewhat loosely in the text, and it might be helpful to provide a clearer definition or distinction between them.
3. How does the author plan to apply the principles of science to the study of politics and economics? The text hints at this application, but it is not entirely clear how the author plans to make this connection.

Mount St. Helens is very majestic site. It was formed 300,000 years ago through the intense heat and pressure caused by colliding tectonic plates. Once formed, the giant volcano towered over the landscape, with only occasional eruptions disturbing a site worthy of a Bob Ross nature painting.

Then in 1980 it changed. What scientists thought would be a small eruption, turned catastrophic. Instead of a—still dangerous—lava flow, the mountain exploded. In a brief moment, half of it was gone. The explosion released so much energy that tons of ash blew into the air and huge winds flattened the surrounding landscape for miles.

An estimated 57 people died. There were billions of dollars worth of damages. The landscape is still very scarred even all these years later. We can hope that the next years will be peaceful, but another eruption will come at some time.

### Generic History

<!-- Yet to to be written. -->

Potidaea	      432 BC	Siege lasting nearly three years; Socrates saved Alcibiades' life
Delium	        424 BC	A significant land battle against the Boeotians
Amphipolis	   ~422 BC	His last recorded military engagement

450-430 BC	Early philosophical exploration	Athens at height of cultural influence
430-415 BC	Development of critical questioning method	Peloponnesian War period
415-399 BC	Mature philosophical approach	Increasing political tensions in Athens


Socrates' most likely sea voyage would have been to Potidaea, a strategic location in northern Greece during the Peloponnesian War. As a hoplite in the Athenian military, he participated in a prolonged siege of this Chalcidice peninsula colony from 432 to 430 BC. To reach Potidaea, Athenian soldiers would have traveled by ship from Athens, making this the most probable maritime journey of his military career.

Documented by Plato and other historical sources, Socrates served with distinction during this campaign. He was known for his exceptional bravery, notably saving Alcibiades' life and demonstrating remarkable endurance. While concrete evidence of a specific sea voyage doesn't exist, the military expedition to Potidaea would have required maritime transport, making it the most historically plausible maritime journey of Socrates' military service.

His military experiences were integral to understanding his character and philosophical approach to life and courage.

Amphipolis marked Socrates' final documented military engagement during the Peloponnesian War, occurring around 422 BC in a strategic city in northern Greece. As a seasoned hoplite in the Athenian military, Socrates continued to demonstrate the exceptional courage and discipline that had characterized his earlier military service. The battle was a critical moment in the ongoing conflict between Athens and Sparta, representing a complex military confrontation with significant strategic implications.

Historical sources, including accounts by Xenophon and references in Platonic dialogues, highlight Socrates' unique military reputation. Unlike many of his contemporaries who might flee during challenging military situations, Socrates was known for maintaining remarkable composure and protecting his fellow soldiers. This characteristic stood in stark contrast to the typical behavior of Athenian troops during the increasingly desperate stages of the Peloponnesian War.

While detailed accounts of Socrates' specific actions at Amphipolis are limited, the battle represents a crucial moment in his military career. It showcased his philosophical approach to warfare - maintaining rational thought and personal integrity even under extreme pressure. Socrates viewed military service as a profound civic and moral responsibility, an extension of his philosophical commitment to virtue and community service.

The engagement at Amphipolis occurred during a particularly challenging period of the war, when Athens was struggling against Spartan-aligned forces. For Socrates, this battle was more than a military confrontation; it was an opportunity to embody the philosophical principles of courage, discipline, and personal integrity that would later define his intellectual legacy. His military service was fundamentally an expression of his deeper philosophical beliefs about human character and civic duty.

Though the specific details of his return from the battle remain obscure, Socrates' reputation as a soldier who could be relied upon in the most challenging circumstances was well-established by this point in his life. The battle of Amphipolis stands as a testament to his multifaceted nature - a philosopher who was equally at home in philosophical discourse and on the battlefield.

Charles Darwin emerged as a promising yet directionless young naturalist from a prominent Shrewsbury family. Born in 1809 to a wealthy doctor, he initially struggled to find his professional path. Despite abandoning medical studies at Edinburgh University and later studying theology at Cambridge, Darwin's true passion lay in natural history and specimen collecting. His father viewed him as somewhat aimless, hoping his son would pursue a conventional career in medicine or the clergy.

Fortunately, influential professors like John Stevens Henslow recognized Darwin's potential and scientific curiosity. His enthusiasm for beetles, geology, and natural specimens set him apart from his contemporaries. Though seemingly unfocused, Darwin was quietly developing the observational skills and intellectual curiosity that would later revolutionize scientific understanding.

Before the HMS Beagle voyage, Darwin was a young man on the cusp of a transformative journey, his remarkable potential not yet fully realized but clearly brewing beneath the surface of his seemingly ordinary early life.

Charles Darwin returned from the HMS Beagle voyage in October 1836, dramatically transformed as a scientific thinker. Historical records indicate he disembarked at Falmouth, Cornwall, on October 2nd, marking the end of his five-year global expedition. Carrying over 1,500 preserved animal specimens and extensive scientific collections, Darwin was no longer the unfocused young man who had originally set sail. His observations, particularly from the Galapagos Islands, would become foundational to his revolutionary theories of evolution and natural selection.

In the years following his return, Darwin worked meticulously, corresponding with leading scientists and carefully analyzing his collected specimens. He developed his groundbreaking ideas in relative secrecy, methodically building evidence for what would become "On the Origin of Species." The voyage had fundamentally reshaped his understanding of natural history, turning him from an amateur naturalist into a systematic scientific researcher poised to challenge existing scientific paradigms about the nature of life on Earth.

## Chapter 5—Clay: What Life Is, The Creator of Players

### Introduction

Techvolution challenges the dominant view that language and culture are what distinguish humans from other hominids. Instead, the book argues that our unparalleled ability to create and adapt tools has been the true driving force behind the success or failure of civilizations and the people inside them. Like our pre-science understanding of the cosmos, our ideologies were engrossing stories, and how made sense of ourselves and our societies, that were, in reality, dependant on how well our technology advancement followed the rules of natural selection. This book is about revealing what evolution is selecting in and out when looking at humanity.

This far into the journey, we've encountered the laws of physics, chemistry, and geology. These laws of nature create the stars, moons, and planet in which we live, and thus the playing field in which life has to work with.

Since humanity is likely the first self-aware creature to exist, it would be easy to say life did not know the laws of nature until we came along. That is not true. As we will see, as soon as life started, it started its long journey to survey and understand the planet. Like the lifting the fog of war, Life spent eons venturing out into the unknown forming new versions of itself to encounter and interact with the playing field in order to harness its resources and keep living.

Not only did Life venture out to harness the playing field made by the laws of physics, chemistry, and geology. Life created used those very laws to create something new, the laws of biology.

### Game Board of Life—Problems Life Must Overcome 

So, we know the laws of nature, and how they created everything from the stars to Earth, but what problems did this gameboard present for life to even get started. Let us find out.

Based on our understanding of the early Earth's environment and the fundamental laws of physics, chemistry, and geology that were in place, we can postulate some of the key challenges and problems that the earliest forms of life would have faced.

**Navigating the Gravitational Gauntlet**

The young Earth, still in the throes of its formative years, exerted a powerful gravitational pull that would have posed a daunting challenge for the first life forms. The first life forms were neccesarily going to be small and weak, yet they would have needed to develop ingenious adaptations to counteract the relentless downward force to form themselves and to relocate. Perhaps they evolved dense, compact structures or even specialized organelles to generate an upward thrust, defying the planet's unyielding grip. Maintaining their structural integrity and mobility in the face of such a formidable force would have been a constant battle for survival.

**Tempering thermal Extremes**

The early Earth's environment was a veritable thermal rollercoaster, with temperatures swinging wildly between the searing heat of volcanic activity and the bone-chilling cold of the planet's surface. For the first fledgling life forms, the laws of thermodynamics would have been a constant concern. Developing sophisticated mechanisms to regulate their internal temperature, perhaps through the use of insulating membranes or heat-dissipating compounds, would have been crucial for their adaptation and growth. Failure to do so would have left them vulnerable to the ravages of these extreme thermal conditions, threatening their very existence.

**Shielding Against Cosmic Bombardment**

In the absence of a robust ozone layer and a well-established magnetic field, the first life forms would have been exposed to a relentless barrage of harmful radiation from the cosmos. The principles of quantum physics dictate that these high-energy particles could have wreaked havoc on the delicate molecular structures that formed the foundation of life, damaging DNA and disrupting essential cellular processes. Evolving protective mechanisms, such as pigments or DNA repair enzymes, would have been a matter of life and death for these pioneering organisms, allowing them to shield their genetic material from the destructive forces of radiation.

**Navigating the Chemical Minefield**

The early Earth's atmosphere and surface were likely composed of a vastly different mix of gases and chemical compounds compared to the balanced, life-sustaining environment we know today. Governed by the laws of chemistry, these alien conditions may have been corrosive, toxic, or even entirely inhospitable to the first life forms. Developing the ability to tolerate or even harness these chemical challenges would have been a crucial adaptation, allowing these primitive organisms to thrive in the face of such a daunting chemical landscape.

**Harnessing the Elusive Energy**

In the absence of well-established energy sources like photosynthesis, the earliest life forms would have faced the formidable task of finding and converting the necessary energy to power their metabolic processes. Guided by the principles of thermodynamics, these organisms would have needed to evolve efficient mechanisms for energy acquisition, storage, and utilization, tapping into the limited resources available in their primordial environment. Failure to do so would have doomed them to a swift demise, unable to sustain the complex biochemical reactions required for life.

**Weathering the Geological Upheaval**

The young Earth was a world in constant flux, its surface and subsurface shaped by the relentless forces of geology. Tectonic activity, volcanic eruptions, and weathering processes would have posed a constant threat to the structural integrity of the first life forms. Guided by the laws of physics and the principles of material science, these organisms would have needed to develop robust, adaptable cellular structures, as well as mechanisms for self-repair, in order to withstand the harsh geological conditions that threatened to tear them apart.

---

In this environment, the task of creating life would have been extremely challenging. The combination of a reducing atmosphere, intense volcanic activity, frequent meteorite impacts, lack of ozone protection, and extreme temperature fluctuations would have presented significant obstacles for the development of even the most primitive life forms.

Overcoming these challenges and creating the conditions necessary for the emergence of life would have required a deep understanding of the physical and chemical processes at play, as well as the ability to manipulate the environment in ways that could support the formation and evolution of the first living organisms.

Good thing there was a bridge between the inert lifeless matter and life, called organic compounds.

### Life's Components

The fundamental laws governing the physical, chemical, and geological processes of the early Earth all played a crucial role in the synthesis and accumulation of organic compounds—the essential building blocks for the origin of life. The laws of thermodynamics, which dictate the flow and transformation of energy, provided the driving force for the formation and rearrangement of chemical bonds, allowing for the creation of increasingly complex organic molecules. The absorption and emission of electromagnetic radiation, such as ultraviolet light and cosmic rays, further fueled photochemical reactions that gave rise to a diverse array of organic compounds. Gravity, too, played a part, concentrating and localizing the necessary elements and energy sources required for organic synthesis. 

The unique properties of carbon, as governed by the principles of atomic structure and chemical bonding, were central to the formation of this organic chemistry. Carbon's ability to form four covalent bonds enabled the construction of a vast diversity of complex molecules, from simple hydrocarbons to intricate biomolecules. The chemical reactions that drove the synthesis, transformation, and stability of these organic compounds were all subject to the laws of kinetics and thermodynamics, which dictated the rates and energetics of the processes involved.

The geological environment of the early Earth also contributed significantly to the emergence of organic compounds. Intense volcanic activity provided the necessary heat and chemical energy to drive the reduction of carbon dioxide and the formation of hydrocarbons, while deep-sea hydrothermal vents created chemical gradients and energy sources that facilitated the synthesis of more complex organic molecules. The impact of meteorites and comets, rich in organic compounds, further supplemented the pool of available materials on the young planet's surface. Weathering and erosion processes then helped to concentrate and localize these organic compounds, making them more accessible for potential incorporation into the first life forms.

Through the interplay of these physical, chemical, and geological forces, the early Earth became a veritable crucible for the creation of the organic compounds that would serve as the foundation for the emergence and evolution of life on our planet. The laws governing the fundamental processes of the universe had set the stage, providing the necessary "building blocks" for the spark of life to ignite.

Organic compounds are the fundamental building blocks of life as we know it. They are essential for various reasons, including serving as structural components, participating in metabolic functions, storing and transmitting genetic information, and acting as catalysts to facilitate and regulate the chemical reactions required for life. Organic compounds like lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids (such as DNA and RNA) form the structural components of cells, power the metabolic processes of living organisms, and enable the storage and transmission of genetic information necessary for life. Without these organic compounds, the complex biochemistry and molecular structures that define living systems simply could not exist.

Organic compounds are believed to have originated in a variety of extraterrestrial and terrestrial environments, even before the emergence of life on Earth.

In interstellar space, complex organic molecules have been detected in interstellar clouds, star-forming regions, and the material between stars. These compounds were likely formed through chemical reactions driven by the laws of physics and chemistry in these cosmic environments.

Many meteorites and comets also contain a diverse array of organic compounds, including amino acids, alcohols, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. These organic-rich bodies are thought to have delivered some of the building blocks of life to the early Earth.

As the young Earth formed and evolved, organic compounds were likely synthesized through a variety of processes, such as volcanic activity, lightning-driven reactions, and hydrothermal vent chemistry, all governed by the laws of physics, chemistry, and geology.

In the period before the emergence of the first life forms, a complex "prebiotic chemistry" may have taken place, where organic compounds spontaneously assembled into more complex structures, setting the stage for the origin of life.

The availability and diversity of these organic compounds in the early Earth's environment would have been a crucial prerequisite for the emergence and evolution of the first life forms, as they provided the necessary raw materials and chemical building blocks for the development of primitive metabolic and genetic systems.

### Life is a Creator

At its core, life is a remarkable phenomenon—a creative force that has arisen from the primordial soup of the early Earth, harnessing the fundamental laws of physics and chemistry to overcome the relentless march of entropy. Where the inanimate world is driven towards disorder, life has found a way to temporarily defy this universal tendency, assembling complex structures and systems that allow for growth, adaptation, and the incredible diversity we see all around us. Ultimately, the definition of life encompasses a range of interconnected properties and processes that distinguish living systems from non-living matter, reflecting the remarkable complexity and adaptability of the natural world.

The question of how life first emerged on Earth is one of the most profound and fascinating in all of science. While there are still many uncertainties and gaps in our knowledge, decades of research have yielded tantalizing clues and plausible theories for life's origins.

The story begins around 4 billion years ago, when Earth was a vastly different place. The young planet had cooled enough for liquid water to form on its surface, creating the oceans that would become the crucible of life. The atmosphere was a tumultuous mix of gases like carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and water vapor, bombarded by intense ultraviolet radiation from the Sun and frequent lightning strikes.

In this harsh primordial environment, a fortuitous combination of chemical ingredients came together. Comets and asteroids delivered organic molecules like amino acids, while geothermal vents on the ocean floor spewed mineral-rich fluids. The abundant energy sources could have powered the formation of more complex compounds from these simpler building blocks.

One leading hypothesis is that life began with the emergence of self-replicating RNA molecules. RNA can both store genetic information and catalyze chemical reactions, making it a strong candidate for the first "living" molecule. In what's known as the "RNA World" scenario, RNA or a similar molecule arose by chance and developed the ability to make copies of itself, kickstarting evolution.

Another possibility is that life started in enclosed compartments like clay membranes or iron sulfide bubbles around hydrothermal vents. These porous structures could have concentrated organic molecules together and provided a selective environment for more efficient self-replicators to proliferate. Over time, these primitive "protocells" might have developed lipid membranes and become increasingly complex.

Regardless of the exact pathway, most scientists believe life likely developed through a series of gradual steps, each building on existing molecules and structures. From self-replicating molecules to simple protocells to true cells possessing genetic material, metabolism, and the ability to reproduce, life as we know it slowly took shape.

Of course, many questions remain. How did the building blocks of life arise from inorganic matter? What were the precise environmental conditions and chemical steps involved? How can we reconcile the various theories and pieces of evidence into a coherent picture? Scientists continue to probe these questions through combinations of laboratory experiments, geological evidence, and computer simulations.

What's clear is that life's emergence was not a single event but a gradual process spanning millions of years. The precise details may never be fully known, lost to the depths of deep time. But by piecing together clues from chemistry, geology, and biology, we are slowly unraveling the mystery of our origins. Each new discovery brings us closer to understanding how, in one remarkable corner of the cosmos, a swirling mix of molecules crossed the threshold to grow into something that seeks to understand and manipulate its environment to keep growing.

In this way, life can be seen as a creative force. Where the natural world might otherwise succumb to the forces of entropy, life has found a way to harness those very forces, using them as the raw materials for its own growth and diversification. It is a testament to the power of the laws of physics and chemistry, and to the incredible potential that arises when those laws are combined with the spark of biological life.

### The Laws of Biology

The quest to unravel the mysteries of the living world has been a long and arduous journey, stretching back to the ancient philosophers and scholars who first began to ponder the fundamental principles governing the natural world. In ancient Greece, thinkers like Aristotle employed keen observation and rudimentary tools to study the anatomy and behavior of various organisms, laying the groundwork for the classification of living things. Though limited by the technology of the time, these early investigations marked the first steps towards understanding the laws of biology.

As the centuries passed, the development of the microscope revolutionized the study of the living world. During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, scholars like Antonie van Leeuwenhoek used these early optical instruments to observe the previously unseen realm of microorganisms, laying the foundations for the germ theory of disease and the understanding of cellular structure. Anatomical studies by the likes of Andreas Vesalius and William Harvey further expanded our knowledge of the human body and its inner workings.

The Age of Enlightenment in the 18th and 19th centuries ushered in a new era of systematic exploration and experimentation in biology. Naturalists like Carl Linnaeus developed comprehensive systems of classification, while pioneering thinkers such as Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace proposed the groundbreaking theory of evolution by natural selection, revolutionizing our understanding of the origins and diversity of life. The continued advancement of the compound microscope allowed scientists to delve deeper into the microscopic world, revealing the intricate structures and functions of cells.

The 20th century witnessed a remarkable acceleration in our understanding of biology, driven by technological advancements and the emergence of new scientific disciplines. The invention of the electron microscope provided unprecedented views of cellular organelles and molecular structures, while the discovery of DNA and the subsequent development of genetic engineering techniques opened up a new frontier in our comprehension of heredity and the mechanisms of life. Biochemistry and molecular biology revealed the complex chemical processes that underpin the functioning of living organisms.

In the contemporary era, biology has become an increasingly interdisciplinary field, drawing upon the insights and tools of physics, chemistry, computer science, and beyond. The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has enabled the mapping of entire genomes, while advanced imaging techniques and computational modeling have allowed for the visualization and analysis of biological systems at unprecedented levels of detail. Integrative approaches, such as systems biology and synthetic biology, are now shedding light on the emergent properties and complex interactions that govern the behavior of living organisms.

Throughout this remarkable journey, the tools and techniques employed by biologists have evolved dramatically, from the simple observation of the natural world to the sophisticated instrumentation and computational power of the modern era. Each advancement in scientific methodology has unlocked new realms of understanding, revealing the intricate laws and principles that govern the living world, and paving the way for continued discoveries and breakthroughs in the ever-expanding field of biology.

As scholars of the natural world, we find ourselves in awe of the remarkable diversity and complexity that characterizes the living organisms that inhabit our planet. Yet, beneath this vibrant tapestry, we discern a unifying set of foundational principles that govern the very essence of biology. Allow me to elucidate these fundamental "rules of nature" that shape the intricate dance of life.

At the most fundamental level, we observe that all living systems are grounded in the chemistry of carbon-based molecules. Proteins, nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), lipids, and carbohydrates—these biomolecules serve as the building blocks, the very scaffolding upon which the structures and functions of life are constructed. It is through the intricate interplay of these chemical constituents that the remarkable properties of living organisms emerge.

Delving deeper, we find that the cell stands as the basic structural and functional unit of all life, whether it be a solitary, single-celled organism or a component of a larger, multicellular being. These microscopic vessels possess the necessary machinery and processes to sustain the very essence of life—metabolism, growth, reproduction, and dynamic response to the environment. It is through the coordinated activities of these cellular units that the grand symphony of life unfolds.

Underpinning the diversity of life is the fundamental principle of genetic information and inheritance. The genetic code, encoded within the DNA (or RNA in certain viruses), serves as the blueprint that directs the structure and function of living organisms. This genetic information is passed from one generation to the next, ensuring the continuity of life and the gradual evolution of species.

Indeed, the process of evolution, driven by the principle of natural selection, is a cornerstone of our understanding of the living world. Through the interplay of variation within a population and the differential survival and reproduction of individuals, new species emerge, and organisms adapt to the ever-changing demands of their environment. This dynamic process has given rise to the remarkable diversity that we observe in the natural world.

The ability of living organisms to harness and transform energy is another fundamental tenet of biology. All life requires a constant supply of energy to sustain its vital processes, and organisms have evolved intricate metabolic pathways to obtain and utilize this energy, often through the conversion of chemical energy (such as ATP) to power cellular activities.

Equally essential to the maintenance of life is the principle of homeostasis and regulation. Living systems possess the remarkable capacity to maintain a relatively stable internal environment, responding to changes in external and internal conditions through complex feedback loops and control mechanisms. This delicate balance is crucial for the survival and functioning of organisms.

Finally, we must recognize the fundamental interdependence of living organisms and their environment. No organism exists in isolation; rather, they are inextricably woven into the tapestry of ecosystems, where the flow of energy and the cycling of nutrients sustain the intricate web of life. It is this interconnectedness that underpins the resilience and sustainability of the natural world.

These foundational principles—the biochemical basis of life, the cell as the basic unit, genetic information and inheritance, evolution by natural selection, energy transformation and metabolism, homeostasis and regulation, and the interdependence of ecosystems—form the cornerstones of our understanding of the living world. By embracing these "rules of nature," we unlock the secrets of the remarkable diversity and complexity that characterize the tapestry of life on our planet.

**Cellular Biology**

The laws of cellular biology are a set of fundamental principles that describe how the basic units of life, cells, are constructed, function, and interact with their environment.

The Law of Cellular Compartmentalization states that cells must be divided into specialized compartments, or organelles, in order to carry out the diverse biochemical processes necessary for life. This compartmentalization is achieved through the self-assembly of lipid bilayer membranes, governed by the principles of molecular self-organization and the laws of thermodynamics. The unique properties of these membrane structures, such as permeability and electrochemical gradients, are essential for cellular function and are dictated by the laws of transport phenomena and electrochemistry.

The Law of Cellular Homeostasis states that cells must maintain a stable internal environment, or homeostasis, in order to function properly. This is accomplished through the regulation of various physical and chemical parameters, such as pH, temperature, and concentrations of ions and metabolites. The mechanisms for maintaining homeostasis involve feedback loops and control systems, as described by the principles of systems biology and the laws of chemical kinetics and thermodynamics.

The Law of Cellular Metabolism states that cells must be able to obtain and utilize energy and nutrients from their environment in order to sustain their structure and function. This process of cellular metabolism is governed by the laws of chemical kinetics, enzyme catalysis, and the principles of cellular respiration (e.g., glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation) and photosynthesis. The efficient conversion and storage of energy in the form of ATP and other high-energy molecules is essential for cellular processes and is dictated by the laws of bioenergetics.

The Law of Cellular Reproduction states that cells must be able to replicate their genetic material and divide in order to propagate and maintain the continuity of life. This is achieved through the laws of molecular genetics, including DNA replication, transcription, and translation, as well as the principles of cell division (mitosis and meiosis). The precise regulation of the cell cycle and the accurate segregation of genetic material during cell division are critical for maintaining genomic integrity and are governed by the laws of cell biology and molecular biology.

These laws of cellular biology, rooted in the fundamental principles of physics, chemistry, and molecular biology, provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the structure, function, and behavior of the basic building blocks of all living organisms.

### What Life Needs

According to the laws of cellular biology, for a life form to survive, it must possess the ability to organize its internal structure into specialized compartments or organelles, enclosed by membranes. This compartmentalization allows the life form to carry out the diverse biochemical processes necessary for life. Additionally, the life form must be able to maintain a stable internal environment or homeostasis, regulating physical and chemical parameters such as pH, temperature, and the concentrations of ions and metabolites. This is accomplished through feedback mechanisms and control systems that preserve the stable internal state required for the life form's proper functioning.

Furthermore, the laws of cellular biology dictate that the life form must be able to obtain and utilize energy and nutrients from its environment. This involves the conversion and storage of energy in the form of ATP and other high-energy molecules, as well as the execution of metabolic processes like cellular respiration and photosynthesis. Lastly, the life form must possess the ability to replicate its genetic material and divide, in order to propagate and maintain the continuity of the species. This requires the precise regulation of the cell cycle and the accurate segregation of genetic material during cell division.

In summary, the fundamental requirements for a life form to survive, as described by the laws of cellular biology, are the capacity to organize its internal structure, maintain homeostasis, obtain and utilize energy and nutrients, and replicate its genetic material and divide. These principles form the foundation for the structure and function of all living organisms.

As a biologist, I would say that for life to live and procreate, it requires the following key elements:

1. Energy Sources: All living organisms require sources of energy to power their metabolic processes and sustain their vital functions. This can come in the form of sunlight (for photosynthetic organisms), chemical energy stored in organic compounds (for heterotrophic organisms), or other forms of energy that can be harnessed and converted into the usable currency of ATP.

2. Raw Materials: Living things need access to the basic building blocks of life—the elements and simple compounds that can be assembled into the complex biomolecules that make up cells, tissues, and organs. This includes carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and a host of other essential elements and molecules.

3. Water: Water is an absolutely critical component for life, serving as the medium in which the biochemical reactions of living organisms take place. It also provides structural support, facilitates the transport of nutrients and waste, and is essential for many other vital functions.

4. Favorable Environmental Conditions: To thrive, life requires an environment that falls within certain parameters of temperature, pH, pressure, and other physical/chemical factors. Different organisms have adapted to a wide range of environmental niches, but all require conditions that allow their cellular and physiological processes to function properly.

5. Genetic Information: The ability to store, transmit, and express genetic information is fundamental to life. DNA and RNA provide the instructions that guide the development, growth, and reproduction of living things, ensuring the continuity of life across generations.

6. Metabolic Pathways: Organisms must have the enzymatic machinery and metabolic pathways necessary to harvest energy from their environment, synthesize the molecules they need, and carry out the myriad chemical reactions required for survival and reproduction.

7. Mechanisms for Reproduction: In order to propagate their species, living things must have the capacity to reproduce, whether through sexual or asexual means. This involves the ability to create new individuals that can carry on the genetic legacy of the parent organism(s).

8. Strategies for Adaptation: To thrive in the face of environmental changes and challenges, life must have the capacity to adapt. This can involve mechanisms for genetic variation, phenotypic plasticity, and the evolution of new traits that enhance an organism's fitness.

By fulfilling these fundamental requirements—access to energy and raw materials, favorable environmental conditions, genetic information, metabolic pathways, reproductive capacity, and adaptive strategies—life is able to not only survive, but to diversify, proliferate, and establish itself as the dominant force shaping the biosphere of our planet.

### Chapter Summary

The chapter begins by challenging the dominant view that language and culture are what distinguish humans from other hominids. Instead, it argues that our unparalleled ability to create and adapt tools has been the true driving force behind the evolutionary success or failure of human civilizations. The book suggests that while our ideologies were engrossing stories that helped make sense of our politics, how well our technological advancement followed the rules of natural selection was ultimately deciding our fate.

The chapter then delves into the fundamental laws of physics, chemistry, and geology that created the playing field in which life had to work. It explains that life did not know these laws of nature until humanity came along, but rather life spent eons venturing out into the unknown, forming new versions of itself to encounter and interact with the physical environment in order to harness its resources and keep living.

The chapter then explores the key challenges and problems that the earliest life forms would have faced on the young, dynamic Earth. This includes navigating the gravitational forces, tempering thermal extremes, shielding against cosmic radiation, overcoming chemical toxicity, and harnessing the elusive energy sources—all of which were governed by the laws of physics, chemistry, and geology.

The text then highlights the crucial role of organic compounds as the building blocks of life, explaining how these complex carbon-based molecules were synthesized through the interplay of physical, chemical, and geological processes. It emphasizes that life is inherently a "creative force," capable of harnessing the fundamental laws of the universe to overcome the tendency towards disorder and create increasingly complex and organized structures.

The chapter then traces the historical development of the scientific understanding of biology, from early observations to modern, interdisciplinary approaches. It underscores the fundamental principles that govern the living world, including the biochemical basis of life, the cell as the basic unit, genetic information and inheritance, evolution by natural selection, energy transformation and metabolism, homeostasis and regulation, and the interdependence of ecosystems.

Finally, the chapter outlines the key requirements for a life form to survive and thrive, as dictated by the laws of cellular biology: the capacity to organize its internal structure, maintain homeostasis, obtain and utilize energy and nutrients, and replicate its genetic material and divide. These principles form the foundation for the structure and function of all living organisms on Earth.

## Chapter 6 - What Evolution Is

### Introduction

To truly understand our place in the story of life, we've been on a journey. The first step was recognizing that the fundamental laws of nature govern the living world's existence. The physical, chemical, and geological processes that have shaped the evolution of life on Earth—from the formation of the planet itself to the cycling of elements and the flow of energy—create the very "gameboard" upon which all organisms, including humans, play on. 

It may seem obvious to say humanity must overcome the same forces of nature as other creatures to survive, but it is not. As a highly intelligent and technologically advanced species, it can be tempting for humans to view ourselves as somehow separate from or above the natural processes that shape the other of life's creatures. Our ability to tell, and believe, in stories makes obscuring that we are playing on the "gameboard" as easy as a watching too many movies or cable news shows.

Our journey to uncover a new perspective about our politics, economics, and condition in general, is based on never forgetting we are just another creature among billions. Thus, like all other living organisms, we are inextricably bound to the same physical, chemical, and geological constraints that have shaped the evolution of life on Earth and no amount of ticking boxes on a ideological scorecard  (ex. "cutting taxes" or "implementing the communist manifesto") matters in comparison.

Hopefully, its a breath of fresh air to join creatres on the "gameboard" of life. Much like the other sciences, once we root politics in the physical reality of the universe, we have a constant reference, a "north star" to judge the success and failure of our political and economic choices and identities.

We're not there yet. We know that life, the creator, uses the laws of biology to conjure up creatures using the laws of nature for the very purpose of forming themselves to survive in the world filled with physical, chemical, and geological forces so hostile to life.

But how does life decide which creations survive and stay in the game? But learning as much about the competition as possible.

### What Life is Playing Against—Entropy

From birth, all life forms grow and search for energy. Every bacteria and fungus, reptile and mammal is always looking for something to eat. But why? Why can life form not work hard and then live off of past sunlight, food, and other forms of energy?

Seems silly to ask but please realize how in the natural world, all forms of energy, and therefore food, are temporary. The reason is the second law of thermodynamics that says in short, "heat naturally flows from hot objects to cooler ones". Cold is the natural way of things, energy can be gained, but most be cherished because it can only be stored for so long. Life needs to continually harness energy because entropy is always taking it away. Therefore life needs life forms that can harness and preserve energy as efficinetly as possible with things like leafs, fur coats, and fat stores to "buy" as much time as possible against the onslaught of entropy.

At the most fundamental level, life is a highly organized and complex phenomenon that exists in a state of dynamic equilibrium, maintained through the continuous input and transformation of energy. Organisms must constantly collect, store, and utilize energy in order to counteract the natural tendency of entropy to degrade and disorganize the intricate structures and processes that define life.

This can be seen in the way that living cells must expend energy to maintain their internal homeostasis, repair damaged biomolecules, and replicate their genetic material. At the organismal level, animals must continuously consume food and water to fuel their metabolic processes and replace the energy that is constantly being lost to the environment through heat, waste, and other forms of dissipation.

Similarly, at the ecosystem level, the cycling of nutrients and the flow of energy through food webs are driven by the need to offset the entropic forces that would otherwise lead to the breakdown and decay of organic matter. The constant replenishment of energy, whether through photosynthesis, chemosynthesis, or the consumption of other organisms, is essential for maintaining the delicate balance and complexity of living systems.

In this sense, life can be viewed as an ongoing struggle against the relentless march of entropy, a battle that has been waged since the earliest emergence of life on Earth. The organisms and ecosystems that are most successful in this race are those that have evolved the most efficient and effective strategies for collecting, storing, and utilizing energy—a process that has driven the incredible diversity and adaptability of life over the course of evolutionary history.

Life needs constant growth and diversity because the more species it has in number and quantity, the more stores of energy it has against entropy's constant draining away of energy, heat, and water.

it is importatnt to note, entropy is not a actual villain. While it does constantly threaten life; it is also a fundamental driver of the creative processes that have given rise to the incredible diversity of life on our planet. As we have already learned, no one yet knows specifically how life started, but entropy had a leading cause. The spontaneous formation of complex organic molecules, the self-organization of living cells, and the evolution of increasingly sophisticated life forms—all of these phenomena were crucial to starting life and can be seen as the result of entropy-driven processes.

Ultimately, the relationship between life and entropy is a fundamental aspect of the natural world, one that shapes the very fabric of the biosphere and the course of life's development on our planet. Volcanic activity and the Sun give Earth constant energy Entropy is simply the time clock that divides life forms between those who can harvest enough of the available energy and those who cannot. By recognizing and understanding this dynamic, we can gain deeper insights into the challenges and opportunities that confront living organisms, including our own species, as we navigate the complex and ever-changing "gameboard" of the physical, chemical, and geological laws that govern our existence.

And life must search out this gameboard and understand its rules to keep playing the game. With the rules of the game so powerful, and entropy so constant. How does life keeping winning?

### Evolution—How Life Plays the Game 

Even though the Sun is constantly shinning on Earth Entropy is a constant force, once the rays hit our planet, entropy is taking the energy away. Life needs creatures that best harness this every so valuable energy. This is a two-staged process. Life is "creator" of living things, and evolution is the "editor" that shapes and refines those creations in the search for the best life forms to overcome entropy.

Life, in its infinite creativity, is constantly generating new variations, new adaptations, new ways of harnessing the laws of physics and chemistry to construct novel biological forms. But it is evolution, with its various mechanisms such as mutation, recombination, and differential reproductive success, that sifts through these variations and selects the most fit and well-adapted versions to propagate into the future.

Evolution is the fundamental process that takes the raw materials and innovations produced by life itself, and then sculpts, refines, and optimizes those living things through the relentless forces of natural selection. Just as an editor takes a writer's initial draft and meticulously refines it, polishing the language and structure to bring out the best in the work, evolution acts as the editor of the living world.

Through the iterative process of variation and selection, evolution edits the creations of life, pruning away the less successful experiments and reinforcing the most effective strategies for survival and reproduction. Over the vast timescales of geological history, this editorial process has given rise to the incredible diversity of life we see today—from the first single-celled organisms to the vast array of complex multicellular life forms, each one a product of evolution's careful curation.

Evolution is the part of the team on the ground. It knows what resources and opportunities exist in the environment. Evolution is not a force of nature, rather it is the explanation that explains which life forms survive and how they survive. Evolution is a tailor. selecting the best team of life forms it can find to harness those resources. Just as a skilled editor can transform a promising but flawed manuscript into a polished, compelling work, evolution takes the raw materials of life and sculpts them into ever more refined and optimized forms. As it relentless edits all life forms, it helps them each reach their full potential, unlocking new avenues for adaptation, diversification, and the conquest of new ecological niches.

In this way, the relationship between life as creator and evolution as editor is a powerful and synergistic one. Life provides the initial spark of innovation, the wellspring of biological novelty, while evolution acts as the guiding hand that shapes and refines those creations over the eons. Together, they have produced the rich tapestry of life that graces our planet, a testament to the incredible potential that arises when the forces of creation and editing work in concert.

One of the most famous examples of evolution in action can be found in the Galápagos Islands, where Charles Darwin observed the remarkable diversity of finch species during his voyage on the HMS Beagle in the 1830s. These birds, now known as Darwin's finches, have become a textbook example of how evolution can drive the emergence of new species.

The Galápagos Islands, located off the coast of Ecuador, are home to a unique and diverse array of flora and fauna, including 13 species of finches that are closely related but exhibit a wide range of beak sizes and shapes. This variation in beak morphology is the key to understanding how these finches have evolved over time.

When the first finches arrived on the Galápagos, they likely encountered a variety of ecological niches, each with its own set of food sources and foraging opportunities. The finches with beak variations that allowed them to exploit these different resources were more successful at surviving and reproducing, passing on their advantageous traits to their offspring.

Over successive generations, natural selection favored the finches best adapted to their particular niche. Finches with larger, stronger beaks were able to crack open larger, tougher seeds, while those with smaller, more delicate beaks were better suited to feeding on smaller, softer seeds. This process of adaptation led to the diversification of the finch species, as they became increasingly specialized for their respective ecological roles.

As the finch populations became more isolated and genetically distinct, the process of speciation began to take hold. Individuals from different species were less likely to interbreed, and the genetic differences between the populations continued to accumulate. Eventually, these once-similar finches evolved into distinct species, each with its own unique beak morphology and foraging behavior.

Today, the 13 species of Darwin's finches on the Galápagos Islands represent a remarkable example of how evolution can drive the diversification of life. This process, known as adaptive radiation, has allowed these birds to thrive in the diverse habitats of the Galápagos, filling a wide range of ecological niches and demonstrating the power of natural selection to shape the natural world.

The Galápagos Island and Darwin's Finches are but one example. Everywhere you look at Earth, from the deepest oceans to the darkest caves, to everywhere around you right now, is teaming with life forms. All of them participating in the game of Life, outrun Entropy by harvesting enough resources to stay a life.

Like the laws of physics, chemistry, geology, and biology, evolution also has laws we can learn and study and master. Here they are.

**The Laws of Evolution**

Evolution, the driving force behind the incredible diversity of life on our planet, is governed by a set of core principles that can be considered the "laws" of this grand natural process. Just as the physical world is constrained by the laws of physics and chemistry, the living world is shaped by these essential tenets of evolution. Let us examine them in detail:

1. Variation: The foundation of evolution is the simple fact that no two living organisms are exactly alike. Even within a single species, individuals exhibit a range of subtle (and sometimes not-so-subtle) differences in their physical traits, behaviors, and genetic makeup. For example, the variations in beak size and shape observed among Darwin's finches on the Galápagos Islands are a classic illustration of this principle.

2. Inheritance: The variations we observe in living things are, to a large degree, passed down from one generation to the next through the process of reproduction. The genetic information encoded in an organism's DNA is replicated and transmitted to its offspring, ensuring that the variations are preserved and can be acted upon by evolutionary forces. This is exemplified by the inheritance of traits like fur color or body size in mammals.

3. Differential Reproduction: Not all individuals within a population are equally successful at surviving and reproducing. Those with variations that confer advantages in their environment will tend to leave behind more offspring than their less-fit counterparts. This unequal reproductive success is the driving force behind evolution. For instance, in a population of giraffes, individuals with longer necks may be better able to reach and consume the leaves at the tops of trees, giving them a reproductive advantage over their shorter-necked peers.

4. Natural Selection: The process by which certain variations are favored over others is known as natural selection. The environment, with all its challenges and opportunities, acts as a filter, allowing the most well-adapted individuals to thrive and pass on their advantageous traits to future generations. The peppered moth story demonstrates how natural selection can lead to rapid changes in a population's appearance as the environment changes, with the better-camouflaged dark form of the moth increasing in frequency over time as industrial pollution darkened the trees.

5. Adaptation: As a result of natural selection, living organisms become increasingly well-suited to their environment over successive generations. Beneficial variations are reinforced, while less useful traits are gradually eliminated, leading to the emergence of adaptations that enhance an organism's chances of survival and reproduction. The development of camouflage patterns in various animal species is a prime example of adaptation.

6. Speciation: Over time, as populations of a species become increasingly isolated and divergent, they may eventually give rise to new species—distinct groups of organisms that can no longer interbreed and exchange genetic material. This process of speciation is a fundamental mechanism by which evolution generates new forms of life. The rapid diversification of cichlid fish in the African Great Lakes, where over 2,000 species have evolved from a small number of ancestral species through adaptation to various ecological niches, is another striking example of speciation.

7. Co-evolution: The evolution of one species is often intimately linked to the evolution of other species within the same ecosystem. This reciprocal process, known as co-evolution, can lead to the development of intricate ecological relationships and the emergence of complex, interdependent communities of living things. The co-evolution of flowering plants and their pollinators, such as bees and butterflies, is a prime example of this principle.

These laws of evolution, grounded in the principles of variation, inheritance, and natural selection, provide the framework for understanding how life has diversified and adapted to the ever-changing conditions of our planet. By accepting these fundamental tenets, biologists have studied the secrets of the living world and gained deeper insights into the remarkable story of life's eternal fight against entropy. let us learn more about how life forms harness energy to not only stay alive but thrive while doing so. let us learn more about the players of the game, species.

### Who Plays the Game—Species

In the grand entropic landscape of the natural world, species emerge as the fundamental units in life's eternal struggle. These distinct groups of interbreeding organisms, bound together by the threads of shared genetic heritage, represent the basic building blocks upon which the complex tapestry of ecosystems is woven.

The question of what constitutes the "unit of selection" in evolutionary theory has long been a subject of debate among biologists. On one side, the influential evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins has argued that the gene is the true unit of selection, as it is the fundamental replicator that is passed on from generation to generation. In contrast, the renowned biologist Ernst Mayr has championed the view that the species, as the basic reproductive community of interbreeding individuals, is the more appropriate unit of selection.

Regardless of this theoretical debate, it is clear that the species plays a crucial role in the ongoing battle against entropy. For each species is, in essence, a collective fortress, a coordinated army of individuals united in the fight for survival. Within the confines of a species, the flow of genetic information and the exchange of vital resources create a resilience that far exceeds the capabilities of any single organism. It is this synergistic strength that allows species to adapt, diversify, and thrive in the face of entropy's onslaught.

The members of a species are driven by a singular imperative: to pass on their genetic legacy to future generations. This relentless pursuit of reproductive success shapes the evolution of a species, as individuals and populations constantly strive to develop the most effective strategies for harnessing energy, repairing damage, and maintaining internal order. These advantageous traits are then propagated through the population, strengthening the species' overall capacity to withstand the ravages of entropy.

Yet, the species themselves are not permanent fixtures in the natural world. Like the individual organisms that compose them, species are subject to the forces of change and the march of time. As environmental conditions shift and new challenges arise, some species may thrive and diversify, while others may dwindle and disappear. The temporary nature of species serves as a reminder that even the most resilient and well-adapted forms of life are ultimately subject to the relentless forces of entropy.

When these species are woven together into the rich tapestry of an ecosystem, their collective might becomes even more formidable. The complementary roles and interdependencies that emerge within these ecological communities create a synergistic defense against the dissipative forces that would seek to unravel the delicate balance of life. It is through the enduring strength of these distinct groups that life continues to defy the relentless march of disorder, ever-evolving, ever-adapting, in its eternal quest for order and organization.

### How Life Wins the Game—Ecosystems

At the heart of the living world lies a remarkable phenomenon—the ecosystem, a intricate web of interdependent organisms and their physical environment, woven together into a tapestry of astounding complexity. It is within these ecological communities that life's battle against entropy finds some of its most formidable fortifications.

For the individual organism, the fight against entropy is a constant, energy-sapping endeavor—a never-ending cycle of repair, replacement, and regulation to stave off the relentless degradation of its vital structures and functions. But when these organisms come together in the rich tapestry of an ecosystem, a synergistic magic begins to unfold.

If species are the players of the game between life and entropy, ecosystems are the teams species sign up to play with.

The diversity of life within an ecosystem creates a redundancy of roles and niches, ensuring that the loss of any one component is less likely to topple the whole. The cycling of nutrients and the flow of energy through intricate food webs act as a circulatory system, replenishing the resources that organisms require to maintain their internal order. And the very physical structures of the ecosystem—the soils, the vegetation, the geological features—provide a bulwark against the entropic forces of weathering and erosion.

It is as if the ecosystem itself has evolved a kind of collective immune system, a defense mechanism that bolsters the resilience of its constituent parts. When a disturbance strikes, whether in the form of a natural disaster or a human-induced disruption, the ecosystem's inherent adaptability and self-organizing capacity often allows it to bounce back, restoring the delicate balance that keeps entropy at bay.

Of course, this ecological fortification is not impenetrable. The relentless march of entropy is ever-present, and human activities have in many cases overwhelmed the ecosystem's capacity for self-repair. But in the grand sweep of life's history, these interconnected communities have proven themselves to be among the most effective weapons in the ongoing battle against the forces of disorder and decay.

So as we seek to understand life's eternal struggle, let us not forget the crucial role played by the ecosystems that sustain it. For it is in these intricate, living tapestries that the very essence of existence is woven, a defiant challenge to the entropy that would seek to unravel it.

### Life and Evolution—Faceless and Forms Against Entropy

Life is faceless and formless. Ready to be whatever is needed to survive against Entropy. Species are committed forms of life with have masks they cannot remove. Species have all the gusto to fight entropy, but must use only what tools they got in hand because their adapations are unchanging. Thus, their masked identity is defined by the adaptions they have on hand. They have life's unwavering desire to survive and procreate, but the sad fate that often their forms are not up to the job. Their masks are not self-aware and will fight to live.

Life is the creator and evolution is the editor. One comes up with the ideas, the other knows the opportunties of the marketplace and decides which ideas to keep. Both one half of the whole that uses laws of nature to survive long enough against entropy to pass on their knowledge and know-how to a new generation of life forms. Life is always there for the ride, while evolution edits its forms to create life forms that always have a conclusion to their involvement.

it is important to remember that life survives through its forms. The forms of life therefore have a life cycle. And its never happened that despite billions of different life forms, over billions of years, a past form of life has been called back into the game. Tyransaurs Rex roamed the Earth once, and will do so again. Such is the skill of life and evolution that every life form is totally unique. It must be so if the player will survive on this gameboard.

And humanity is no different. Remember, that it took many years for humanity to discover the laws of nature. From mythology to science was a centuries long process with many failures. This process of ignorance to mastery is the same for all life forms.

When a species or group of organisms first colonizes a new environment, they are essentially operating in a state of ignorance. They have not yet developed the specialized adaptations necessary to efficiently exploit the resources and navigate the unique conditions of that environment. As a result, many of the initial colonizers may struggle to survive and reproduce, as they lack the necessary traits to compete effectively.

However, over successive generations, the process of natural selection begins to favor those individuals with variations that confer advantages in the new environment. These advantageous traits may include things like specialized feeding mechanisms, enhanced sensory capabilities, or adaptations to the local climate and terrain. As these beneficial variations are passed on and reinforced, new species begin to emerge, each one tailored to a specific niche or set of environmental conditions.

It is only through this process of adaptive radiation and speciation that life is able to fully harness the resources and opportunities presented by a new environment. The diverse array of specialized species that eventually arise can collectively exploit a wide range of niches, accessing a broader spectrum of available resources and thriving in ways that the initial, generalist colonizers could not.

This pattern can be observed throughout the history of life on Earth, from the colonization of terrestrial environments by early plants and animals to the diversification of life in the deep-sea hydrothermal vents. In each case, the initial encounter with a new environment is marked by a period of uncertainty and struggle, until the evolutionary process can generate the specialized adaptations necessary for life to truly flourish.

So, in essence, the ignorance of life when first confronted with a new environment is a temporary state, one that is overcome through the power of evolution and the emergence of new, highly adapted species. It is this dynamic interplay between life and its environment that has driven the remarkable diversity and resilience of the living world.

We can indeed draw a parallel between life's initial ignorance of a new environment and humanity's early reliance on mythologies to understand the world, and the subsequent process of gaining a deeper, scientific understanding through experimentation and observation.

Just as life encounters a previously unexplored environment with a lack of specialized adaptations, early human civilizations confronted the natural world with a limited understanding, often resorting to mythological explanations to make sense of the phenomena they observed. These mythologies, much like the initial ignorance of life, were a product of the human mind's attempt to grapple with the unfamiliar.

However, just as life gradually evolves specialized species to harness the resources and navigate the challenges of a new environment, humanity has progressively developed more sophisticated, evidence-based scientific methods to unravel the mysteries of the world around us. Through experimentation, observation, and the accumulation of empirical knowledge, we have been able to replace the mythological narratives with a deeper, more nuanced understanding of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that govern the natural world.

This parallel is particularly striking when we consider the evolution of our understanding of the cosmos, for example. Early human civilizations often attributed the movements of celestial bodies and the changing of the seasons to the whims of deities or the workings of a divine plan. It was only through the gradual development of astronomy, physics, and other scientific disciplines that we were able to replace these mythological explanations with a comprehensive, evidence-based understanding of the laws and mechanisms that underpin the universe.

Similarly, the gradual unraveling of the mysteries of the natural world, from the inner workings of the cell to the dynamics of ecosystems, has followed a trajectory akin to life's own process of adaptation and specialization. Just as life has evolved an increasingly intricate array of species to exploit the resources and navigate the challenges of diverse environments, humanity has developed an ever-more sophisticated scientific framework to comprehend the complexities of the natural world.

In both cases, the journey from ignorance to understanding is marked by a relentless pursuit of knowledge, a willingness to challenge existing assumptions, and a deep respect for the power of empirical observation and experimentation. It is through this shared process of discovery and enlightenment that life and humanity have been able to transcend the limitations of their initial ignorance and forge a deeper, more meaningful connection with the natural world.

### Summary

We are on a mission to truly understand politics, economics, and the ideologies we follow. To place those topics alongside physics, astronomy, and the other sciences where accurate predictions are boring we've emulated the lessons life has had to learn over the years as it ventured over this ever changing planet. We learned the laws of physics, chemistry, and geology so we understand how they mold Earth and create the rules of the gameboard all life forms must play on to survive.

Life is a faceless thing. It only wants to grow and stay alive. life forms are short-term applications of life. Since species cannot change their form they are masked in a sense, because although they have life's burning desire to survive, they cannot change their form or instincts. And alas, since the environment in which they live is always changing, life needs review its masked players often. life forms have a limited shelf-life as life needs to find players that better fit the available resources.

Importantly, even though species have a burning desire to survive, they do not play against each other. In the grand scheme, every life form depends on another for survival. Life, and therefore life forms, are really playing against entropy. The law of physics that sucks the heat and energy away from all things, living and dead. life forms must collect enough energy to stay ahead of entropy's wrath or life, via evoluion, finds another species to play the game.

life forms work together inside ecosystems. The place where individuals can master a sliver of resource collection to contribute to the war against entropy. The balancing act of ecosystems keeps life forms playing to win, as any slackers will face near immediate competition. If a individual tree refuses to keep growing, others will and capture the sunlight for themselves. If all the individuals that make up the trees species cannot win enough available water and sunlight, the species is replaced with someone else.

The laws of evolution state life will venture out into the unknown, and the fittest will survive. Slowly this means life forms adapt from masses into specialized niches, as did Darwin's Finches on the Galapagos islands. Widespread expansion of a species will inevitably lead to adaptation of that species into new life forms. life form expansion and adaptation is a recurring theme in the story of evolution.

Key to this understanding is that evolution is deaf, dumb, and mute. While life is open to creating any kind of life form, evolution only wants the winners. There's no way of briding evolution. Evolution does not understand any language, see any life form, or listen to any stories. Evolution cannot select the players on the gameboard according to anything other its adaptations effectiveness to harness resources. Cold climates need insulation. Hot ones need cooling. The life forms that harvest and use resources the most efficiently inside a ecosystem get a spot on the team, and once they have their mask on, will do anything they can do to survive.

With all this knowledge of the natural laws of physics, chemistry, geology, biology, and evolition, we are not ready to chart the history of life's evolution.
