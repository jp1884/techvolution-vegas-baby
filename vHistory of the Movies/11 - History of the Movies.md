Are you happy? On the outside, Westerners have flashy products, full employment, and stable politics. On the inside, our middle-class deals with stagnate wages, crushing debts, antisocial behavior, political hatred, climate change. We have the freedom to vote Left or Right, moderate and extreme, and we've tried them all, but none have helped.

In this book, I argue our unhappiness is a sign of a bigger problem. Our ideologies are very outdated. They were created in the Industrial Age, and since 1970, we've been in the Computer Age. Our ideologies are holding us back, which is causing our frustrating lifestyles and growing social problems. We need a new philosophy—one created to harness the remarkable potential of electronic tools.

Here it is. Its big lesson is this. The middle-class has to step up and use digital technology to solve our own problems. If we don't, we'll keep suffering the pains of civilization running on old—ideological—fumes.

# Introduction

The movies used to be a fun, energetic, and affordable night out. The movies told functional stories to an eager public.  They’ve become boring spectacle and self-indulgent art that costs too much. There are some gems, and premium TV has filled the void, but neither is enough to replace lost movie magic. This happened because because the movies were so successful, they got controlled by executives concerned over short-term profit, and had to use spectacle and copyright ownership of American culture to maintain the ride.

All isn't lost. The movie industry suffers most because of fixable flaw. Movie makers dont' own their own theatres. We should make the movie theatre the central money makers to bring the movies back to their old glory.

In the second part of No More Magic, we explain how the movies aren’t just for entertainment. When movies became boring spectacle in the 1980's America lost its quality mass storyteller. Thereafters it was prevented all of us from hearing and understanding each others thoughts and emotions and turned our politics into simple bickering.

In the third part of we see how the movies can be merged with coming technology like digital filmmaking, computers games, and virtual reality, so society can function better as its members understand each other through the magic of good storytelling.

But first we must understand where the movies came from, how they grew to dominate the world, and where they went so wrong.

# What is a Movie

A movie is a story. A sequence of events with a beginning, middle, and end. There are other kinds of movies, from experimental, to documentary, but the vast majority of movies are storytellers. Most importantly when people think of movies, they think of being told a story.

Movies resemble stage plays, with scripts, sets, actors, directors, and audiences — except that movies are not live performances, but are recordings of many performances assembled together using many technologies. Movies thus depend on technology to exist. Among the technologies is a camera to capture images onto a record and equipment to record sound and edit the images and sound into a coherent narrative. The most basic and most important technology in movies is seen in its name, namely the technology to move many pictures through a light source fast enough to give the impression of seamless movement. The film and reel technology to do this was developing in the late 19th century, and it came to fruition in 1894 with the Kinetoscope, which was developed by Thomas Edison’s laboratory.

The Kinetoscope was a vending machine for movies. It was the first machine that could move celluloid pictures fast enough over a light source to create the illusion of movement. The first movies were roughly 40-second novelty films of a contortionist or a boxing match, and were viewed through a small viewing hole in the Kinetoscope. Hence, the first films were not projected, and were called peep shows. Kinetoscope viewing parlors spread throughout American cities, and were very successful. Soon after, however, Kinetoscope technology turned into projector technology; projectors allowed films to be projected onto a screen, and also allowed longer rolls of film to be assembled together. Movies became longer, and grew into increasingly complex stories known as silent films; silent because, although effects and music were included, sound couldn’t yet be synchronized with projection to enable dialogue.

Silent films grew gradually from the novelty films that the Kinetoscope showed to full narratives with a cast of characters and a plot. At first, these movies were short films of about 30 minutes, but they were exhibited alongside short stories, newsreels, and serial stories in movie theaters called nickelodeons (because a ticket cost a nickel). These multiple and varied-format movies constituted a typical movie show, and were more popular than their older sibling, the peep show. By the mid-1910’s, projector technology was sufficiently advanced to allow a movie to be over three hours long. The growth in actual film length and the accompanying development of narratives in movies enabled a full three-act play to be shown in a movie.

This capacity to show a complete narrative story was fully realized in *The Birth of a Nation* (1915), a silent movie whose racist narrative was so powerful it caused protests in many northern American cities and the second birth of the Ku Klux Klan throughout America.

The growing complexity of movie narratives brought new movie making companies. Up until the mid-1910’s, filmmakers were those who had started making Kinetoscope movies, now known as the Motion Picture Patents Company (MPPC). These filmmakers specialized in making simple movies for the Kinetoscope. The MPPC used its patents over the Kinetoscope and its technological offspring, the early film projectors, to control movie production and exhibition by demanding patent fees from any movie producer, distributor, or exhibitor. However, the MPPC production companies were unable to produce the longer narratives audiences were attending and paying more for [^1]. Thus, independent production companies started doing better business, leaving the US East Coast, where the MPPC was based, and going to Hollywood, California, to set up new companies away from MPPC meddling (Hollywood also had pleasant weather and varied geography, both good for outdoor shooting). The MPPC eventually died entirely because it lost its patents with the advent of newer projection technology.

The new Hollywood companies finally shook off the power of the MPPC, and started to consolidate and build massive production houses which soon bore the major Hollywood studios 20th Century Fox, Metro Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Paramount Pictures, RKO Radio Pictures, Warner Bros., and mini-majors Universal, Columbia, and United Artists. These companies made a variety of movies, but specialized in making feature-length films with a brand, called a “house style.” Although its output was always changing, each studio was known for a distinctive house style. MGM became known for high-quality, glamorous movies and musicals[^2], Universal for horror movies[^3], Fox for a mélange of adult musicals, light comedy-drama, and American adventure tales, Warner Brothers for contemporary crime thrillers[^4], and Paramount for sex comedies and for its sheer quantity of films and theater[^5]. By contrast, RKO was too dysfunctional to develop a house style[^6]. These studio films were packaged with short films, newsreels, serials, and live performances, as movies had always been, to offer an entire, polished and professional entertainment show at the movies. These shows were distributed to independent theaters or company-owned exhibitors in rural America, or increasingly in rapidly growing urban America, whose market was by far the most competitive and lucrative. Urban theaters were called movie palaces, as a mark of their grandeur. This was the dawn of the age of Hollywood as a movie production center, and the studio system, as it would soon be called, soon controlled, either directly or indirectly, movie production, distribution, and exhibition in America.

The movies had come a long way from the old peepshows. So people began to wonder what made a proper movie, what a movie should be, how it should be produced, and what standards a movie should have. These questions sound simple, but, as GM learned with the failure of transforming automobiles into ever larger SUVs, they were not always easy to answer. In the early days of filmmaking, when dialogue wasn’t even possible, Hollywood was not sure that narratives were the way to go, as filmmakers were still learning how to use movies to tell stories. For example, early movies would show the same event, say a murder, multiple times from the different perspectives of the victim, the criminal, and an observer, because filmmakers didn’t know about intercutting perspectives to make a single scene of the murder. Telling narratives in movies, with techniques such as continuity editing, panoramic long shots, three-point lighting, and mass staged sequences, was a learning process.

*The Birth of a Nation* (1915) showed that a movie could convey a coherent and emotional story, and when *The Jazz Singer* (1927) introduced dialogue, to immediate market acclaim, movies were confirmed as full-feature storytellers. However, the industry needed to produce enough stories to meet consumer demand, week after week, and, as anyone in the movie industry then and now will attest, if it is hard to make one good movie, it is immeasurably harder to do so repeatedly and consistently. Knowing what a story exactly is, what a story is composed of and what components are most important, is the first step to manufacturing stories. The oldest and still probably best explanation of the essence of storytelling is the work of Aristotle, who in *Poetics* discovers the nature of stories.

According to Aristotle a story is a character addressing a problem through a series of events. The events are organized in three acts. The first act is the introduction of the problem, the protagonist who fights to overcome it, and the antagonist who fights against the protagonist. The second act is where both characters and their supporters fight over the problem. In the third act, the question of which side will win is answered in the climax. Throughout this process, drama is created by constant questions about how the events will progress and whether the problem will be overcome. The story is thus exciting, because it yields surprises as the events unfold. Crucially, Aristotle notes that the more unexpected, yet logical, the events are, the better the story becomes, because a logical story is a believable one. Believability in turn allows the audience to invest their emotions into the story; hence, a well-told story makes us feel surprised, intrigued, mad, disgusted, joyous, or any other emotion.

For example think of *Star Wars*. That story is about a feeble and hidden rebel alliance fighting to bring down an evil galactic empire. The empire depends on its all-powerful vessel called the Death Star to keep the galaxy under its control. The rebels have just stolen schematics for the Death Star that could help destroy it. The protagonist of *Star Wars* is Luke Skywalker, a young boy who yearns to leave the farm and fight for freedom with the rebels as a Jedi warrior monk. The antagonist is Darth Vader, a powerful and evil Sith Lord who rules the galactic empire and opposes the Jedi. Both Jedi and Sith use the same mysterious power of The Force to expand their mental and physical abilities. The problem in *Star Wars* is evil forces rule the galaxy, and good forces struggle to defeat them. Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Han Solo fight against the empire by struggling to bring the secret structural plans of the Death Star to hidden rebel leaders able to destroy it. Darth Vader and his supporters in the empire struggle to stop them. The secret plans are finally delivered, an event which also shows the empire where the rebel leaders are. Both sides gear up all their forces for a space dogfight in the story’s climax. Will the rocket Luke Skywalker shoots from his fighter enter the Death Star’s weak point and destroy the vessel and bring down the evil empire?

In *Star Wars*, and all narratives, the story is a problem being fought over by characters in a series of events. The events are organized into three acts, introduction of the problem, the fight between the characters over the problem, until their mutual struggles ends in a climax, which showcases how the problem will be answered. As both sides struggle over the problem, the events must be logical enough to allow audience’s reason to comprehend it, and but also unexpected enough to entice emotional responses. For example, Darth Vader and Obi-Wan both use the Force. However, relative to the audiences own lives, the Force is a mysterious power that must be explained and integrated into the story, otherwise random and unexplained displays of extraordinary power would leave the audience thinking of how it can be possible to jump so high, or choke a person with your mind. Making the audience use their own reasoning to accept or reject what they are seeing breaks their emotional investment. This unreasonable writing often happens in 43 minute serial television crime shows where a “lab-geek” character can use facial recognition software or DNA analysis to find suspects in seconds, which is so unrealistic (because it’s not explained) it inhibits strong audience emotions. However, since the Force is explained so well in *Star Wars*, it allows the audience member to be surprised and angry when Darth Vader kills Obi-Wan with it, yet excited and happy when Luke destroys the Death Star with it. *Star Wars* of course is fiction, yet because the story adheres to Aristotle’s principle of logical storytelling, a fictitious story is believable, and therefore entices strong emotional responses from the audience as it moves through the story.

A story can take place in any number of locations and time periods, expressing different beliefs and virtues of the protagonist and antagonist. For storytelling there is no difference between a serious drama, or a children’s tale, as long as the story makes sense to itself and is well told[^7]. Fundamentally, a story is just a problem being fought over. The story itself has components. Aristotle noted six elements in dramatic storytelling. They are listed in priority below, first to last.

**Plot** comprises the arrangement of incidents of the story. The best plots, according to Aristotle, have a change of fortune for the protagonist from bad to good, or vice versa, which helps arouse strong emotions in the audience. Incidents should be logical and follow naturally from the actions that precede them. The incidents will be more satisfying to the audience if they come as a surprise, and if the audience at first thinks them to be coincidence; soon, however, the audience must see them as plausible, even necessary. Key incidents in the plot are the reversal of situations, recognition’s of mistakes, and the suffering of the protagonist. For example, in *The Shawshank Redemption*, the protagonist, Andy, wrongfully convicted of murder, suffers in jail under a brutal and religious warden, who knowingly acts to keep the innocent man behind bars. This arouses great pity in the audience. Then, after one especially brutal punishment from the warden, Andy doesn’t come out of his cell; presumably he snaps and kills himself. The plot then reverses the situation, stimulating a great emotional response. Andy has actually escaped. He has dug an escape route all the while he was incarcerated, using a little rock cutting tool he had acquired in jail. The escape tool was hidden inside a Bible, which the warden poetically said would be Andy’s salvation. The warden soon kills himself to avoid earthly punishment while Andy lives his life in freedom on a beautiful beach.

**Character** refers to the persons swept up in the events of the plot. Characters must be consistent in their characteristics and beliefs and believable in their traits, and any changes to their character must be explained, which normally means explaining how the events of the plot changed and therefore revealed a character as being, for example, strong-willed, loving, hateful, cowardly, or in Andy’s case, patient. Character is secondary to plot because says Aristotle a “character determines men’s qualities, but it is by their actions that they are happy or the reverse.” In short, you would never actually know Luke Skywalker hated the evil empire, unless he actually went to fight it or that Andy was so cunning unless he tried to escape from jail instead of just talking about it. Acting, speaks louder than words. Yet characters are still vital because they are an audience’s gateway into a story.

<figcaption>Andy won. So he, and we, are happy. Good acting is not showing emotion, it’s doing something that makes us feel emotion</figcaption>
</figure>

**Thought** refers to the deep convictions and motives of the characters. Thought explains why a character fights during the story. The love that Romeo and Juliet have for each other is a deep conviction, as is the hatred between their families. The eternal struggle of Jedi and Sith is another strong motivation, especially when mixed with the love and hatred Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker have as father and son. Convictions help motivate and justify the actions of the characters as they travel through the plot.

<figcaption>Motivation at first sight</figcaption>
</figure>

**Dialogue** consists of the arrangement of spoken words, either by the character or the narrator, and represents the thoughts of the characters as they each proceed through the plot.

Dialogue is the jokes characters tell, the way the plot is often revealed to the audiences. The most memorable moments of a movie is often its best lines. “Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.”, “Do you feel lucky punk?”, and “May the force be with you”.

However dialogue can only extenuate the plot, through its characters, of a story. We’ll discuss this in more detail below, but that’s why franchise movies don’t have many memorable lines. For example what’s the memorable line from a recent Star Wars movie? or Die Hard sequel? The loss of memorable lines showcases how dialogue is still only serves a (good) plot.

**Chorus**, or song, is the music in a play, which itself becomes a character, conveying and illuminating the emotions behind the plot and its characters. A great example is the “Jaws” theme, which creates suspense in the audience with just a few notes. The few notes of the the Jaws theme made enough to make a generation of people fear the water. That is the power of music when used within a story.

Another example is The Lord of the Rings, whose great score almost tells the story itself. Take a listen, jump around, and you can feel where you are in the story each time.

**Spectacle** refers to the visual apparatus of the play, including set, costumes, effects, and props, which help show the story to the audience. Aristotle calls spectacle the least artistic element of storytelling, and the least connected with the work of the writer. “Besides, the production of spectacular effects depends more on the art of the stage machinist than on that of the poet.”[^8]

<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">
<img src="/src/img/nmm/braveheart-props.jpg" class="kg-image">
<figcaption>Props manifest the story in the real world, making it easier to follow and understand</figcaption>
</figure>

Braveheart showcases how a prop can help tell a story. It uses a flower/cloth to make the audience see the love William Wallace and Murron MacClannough have for each other, and then the love Scotland has for their ultimate sacrifice. After Williams father died, Murron gave him a flower at the funeral. William leaves for several years, returns to the village and woes Murron. William returns the flower inside a cloth to Murron. He saved the flower!  Murron was smitten.  Too smitten, because to get at the young and dangerous Wallace, the English kill Murron, and wipe her own blood with a cloth. William kills the English garrison and keeps the cloth as a memento. William holds the cloth while fighting the English, and even when he is dismembered. At the end of the story, the Scottish king finally gets the courage to fight the English by King gripping Williams and Murrons cloth. The flower/cloth helps the view understand the entire story of Braveheart because it was the actualization of the story into a physical object.

However the point here is that the actual prop, be it a cloth, flower, or a Death Star, is easier to make then knowing how to use spectacle to advance a story. Most movies today concentrate on the effect/prop and forget it’s suppose to mean something, and help advance a story. This is because movies don’t try to tell a story anymore, which we’ll discuss in detail later.

These elements compose every story, just as an engine, chassis, and transmission compose a car. A properly told story integrates each element to maximize audience engagement because the purpose of a story is again simple, to engage a person’s reason to make him believe the story and thus to generate an emotional investment in it. Writer David Mamet explains, “Interest in film comes from this: the desire to find out what happens next.”[^9] Making audiences wonder what is going to happen next, is movie magic.

This is the framework for proper storytelling, and thus movie making. Movie producers slowly came to a realization of this. But since movies are not standardized products like a car or a fridge, the movie industry could not simply perfect a product and then mass produce it, as Ford or General Electric was doing in the early 20th Century. The movie industry had to have variations in each of its products that surprised its audience by creating new problems and new motivations for the characters to encounter, as well as other components of storytelling, including dialogue, music, and spectacle.

# The Studio System

## Manufacturing Movies

The studio system was Hollywood’s solution to producing many high-quality movies. The studio system aimed to mix industrialization with creativity to consistently produce good movies. The studio system industrialized moviemaking by first segmenting it into four broad categories: pre-production, production, post-production, and finalization. Pre-production consisted of preparing a movie’s story by imagining a problem; then creating characters to fight over the problem; writing a script based on the plot; and assigning actors who began rehearsing their roles while the sets were being built. The production category involved shooting the story onto film. Scenes in the script were visually imagined by the director, who then determined how they should be shot on the finished set, while the cameraman decided how to light them. Actors then acted the scenes in front of the cameras until each was perfected. At the post-production stage, the scenes were assembled into a coherent narrative emphasizing the drama, by using effects, music, and extra dialogue. At the last step, finalization, the movie was previewed to audiences, whose reactions dictated what worked and what needed to be redone. Once this had been established, the movie would be reshot to enhance the good parts and get rid of the bad.

These four categories of producing stories were further divided into sub-categories that constituted jobs. The writer did the pre-production work of devising a problem, characters, dialogue, and settings of the story, and assembling them into a script, which is a sparsely written representation of a visual story. The director was responsible for physically shooting the story onto film by translating the sparse words of the script into visual images using actors and sets. The director interpreted the meaning of the script, and told people on set what to do, how the scene should be lit, how the actors should play their parts, and how elements of the plot should be revealed. The director, sometimes working with other members of the crew and cast, might request rewrites to the script to accommodate changes in the way the story was progressing while being shot. The actors portrayed the characters, turning an outline characterization from the script into believable people by creating a coherent set of idiosyncrasies, speech, and behavior — whether the character slouched, for example, or slurred his words, or stalled before responding to an insult. The editor decided which takes to use and how exactly to assemble and order the takes to maximize dramatic effect, which could sometimes mean almost in effect rewriting the script using the available footage. The composer wrote and assembled music to accompany the movie and add to its dramatic effect. The craftsmen assembled props and sets, and devised effects to help tell the story. Finally there was the producer, who created a budget for the movie, as well as deciding whom to assign for each job and when and where to shoot the scenes. The producer’s job was financial, but primarily involved supervision to ensure that each member of the team stayed on task. The Best Picture Oscar is given to a movie’s producer for this reason, because he is responsible for the totality of the movie.

These jobs correspond with the basics of the story as noted by Aristotle. The screenwriter is mainly concerned with making up a plot and writing characters and dialogue. The director considers how to shoot the script, how the dialogue should be spoken, and how best to convey the plot. The actors work on the character and the dialogue, and craftsmen build the spectacle of sets, props, and costumes to aid the director and actors immerse themselves and the audience in the story. The editor arranges the takes into a coherent whole. When the film is complete, the composer writes the chorus or songs, and the craftsmen finalize the movie by including the spectacle of effects.

In the early studio system, each job was performed by a team of workers, writers, directors, editors, actors, and so on. Each worker had strengths and weaknesses, and would be deployed to the films to which his skills were best suited. Collaboration was king. Some writers mainly wrote dialogue, others came up with characters, still others with plot ideas, some were only good at elements such as one-liners, and a few were good at all these elements and so wrote entire scripts solo. Some directors specialized in action sequences or romantic scenes, and actors would go from role to role, as directed by the studio and only rarely perform outside of their typical character as built up and defined by the studio. Studios would often loan their workers to other studios as well.

It was at the sub-category level of the hierarchy of jobs that industrialization ended and creativity began. Individual creativity was allowed to instill art into the movie at each segmented stage. Producers weren’t supposed to micro-manage their talent, only to decide if the choices they made were acceptable (to the story and studio’s style) or not. Thus, the elements of storytelling were arranged slightly differently in every film in order to churn out new stories fast enough to supply America’s burgeoning demand.

That very high demand was responsible for the further industrialization of the process. Where once it had been the producer who sought finance and talent, and who made each movie a reality, now it became the studio production chiefs who controlled all the studio’s movies. Studio chiefs were producers who handled, directly or indirectly, all the elements of every movie in production. It was Irving Thalberg who pioneered the studio system, beginning in 1920 when he arrived in Hollywood at the age of 21[^10]. Other chiefs were Darryl F. Zanuck (20th Century Fox), Adolph Zukor (Paramount), Jack Warner and Hal Wallis (Warner Bros.), Harry Cohn (Columbia Pictures), Walt Disney at Walt Disney Productions, and David O. Selznick and Sam Goldwyn at various studios. Studio chiefs had an immense understanding of story, maintained very high standards, and were capable of coordinating the production of movies at various levels. Keeping track of all this was a very complex business, and the writer F. Scott Fitzgerald described it as, “not a half dozen men have been able to keep the whole equation of pictures in their heads”[^11].

The production chiefs’ main task was, however, rather simple, namely to judge the accomplishment of each job, and to allow a movie to progress to the next stage of production (or not), giving instructions to fix any problem, and delegate authority to the next job. The chiefs did this by holding a huge number of meetings for members from every department to evaluate their work and give direction, receiving written updates from each department and trusting several close producers to act on their behalf. And while this system’s strong oversight of its workers emulated other assembly lines, it was the freedom of the individual specialists at each segment that allowed creativity to flow in the movies, and make each different and thus worth watching. Since most film crew and cast were under long-term contracts, the same group of people worked together and honed their skills and worked fast together in teams (what the studio system called production units) to produce between 20 and 40 high-quality movies a year. As most filmmakers past and present will attest, filmmaking is so complicated that it is astounding that a movie, regardless of its quality, ever sees the light of day.

The studio system, with its mixture of industrialization and individual expression, managed to produce quality stories consistently, earning itself the epithet “genius,” because no individual created a movie; rather, the system itself was the creator. The system remained in place for the next two decades, during which time the movies established themselves as the pinnacle of American and world entertainment. Movies, after all, told stories very well, and people all over the world love to hear stories. Stories allow persons to organize knowledge coherently, and make it easy to express, share, and contest beliefs, interests, morality, and entertainment within a community. Especially important; good stories are easy to remember so most anyone can watch a movie. This is because good stories explain themselves so well. For example ask a person to remember a scene from a good movie, say the scene in *Forest Gump *when Forest learns ping pong. To prompt their memory you can just say “it’s when he’s in the hospital with a wounded ass, after he got shot in the buttocks in Vietnam trying to save Bubba.”, and they will remember when in the story Forest learns ping-pong, and how easily Forest took to ping-pong, how much he practiced, and how good he was. It doesn’t matter if years or decades have passed since a person saw it, most viewers will remember Forest Gump finds great success at ping-pong, like everything else he tries, despite his mental drawbacks. Because the perseverance of Forest Gump is what the entire story was about.

Stories greatest power is the ability to convey a lot much information very easily. For this reasons humans crave stories as a means of social interaction and a fundamental way to make sense of the world[^12]. This is best evidenced by the explosion of attendance at movie theaters in America and throughout the world, but it has its roots in nature. In *Poetics*, Aristotle notes that people like stories because stories are imitations of life, and humans from childhood on learn and experience life by imitating others as a way for people to understand one another. For example, watching happy-ending, wholesome stories, which were typical in the 1930’s, helped Americans forget the Great Depression. The famous, or infamous, Hollywood Production Code (which basically promoted family-oriented movies) was a voluntary set of rules Hollywood used to govern itself to ensure Hollywood stories could be told to anyone in America (and to ensure the government would not regulate films). The Production Code meant that movies could be watched by anyone, and Hollywood’s movies then literally became the quintessential hallmark of American culture. Americans went to the movie theater in their millions every week.

The best storyteller in the 1920’s and 30’s was Irving Thalberg. Called the “boy wonder” Thalberg was instrumental in creating the studio system, and turned MGM into the pinnacle studio during Hollywood’s Golden Age by telling the best stories, such as *Grand Hotel* (1932*)*, *Mutiny on the Bounty* (1935*)*, and *Gone with the Wind* (1939). To understand the genius of Thalberg, it is only necessary to know that he shares many characteristics with Steve Jobs. Both men had a humble upbringing with little formal education, and quickly succeeded in their youth because of their great intuition. Both men maintained their success with obsessive attention to detail and quality. And both had to fight for the freedom to keep succeeding against a corporate culture that thought in terms of short-sighted financial numbers and returns. Sadly, too, both Thalberg and Jobs passed away too early, Thalberg at 37, Jobs at 56. These two giants of innovation had extraordinary ability to see what people wanted from new technology and how to make that technology function in society.

Admissions data reflect the success of the new medium of film. In 1925, movie admissions were 50 million per week in America. By 1930 they were approaching 100 million per week[^13]. In America in 1930, 65% of the population went to a movie each week. That number dropped to 40% at the onset of the Great Depression in 1932; but, even during the economic crisis and the Second World War, attendance rose steadily, until by 1948 it had reached about 60%[^14].Starting his career with Universal Studios as a typist at 20 years old in 1919, Thalberg quickly distinguished himself by his talent and insight, rising through the ranks and eventually becoming production chief. Movies had touched a nerve with America, yet they were not doing so consistently; leaving nothing to chance, Thalberg created stories that would elicit emotional reactions from viewers, and built the studio system to produce his will. Thalberg knew, as Aristotle noted, that if the audience could empathize with the protagonist, they would attach themselves emotionally to him or her. This meant that movies could engross a person more than any other entertainment medium[^15]. When movies started, there was no reason to believe that they were here to stay. Radio, vaudeville, operas, novels, stage plays were all more developed than movies, and in the 1910’s and 1920’s were more viable modes of entertainment[^16]. However, none of these media could fill the hearts of Americans in the way that properly produced movies could. Only a movie could tell a three-act story that would open up the minds and hearts of the audience in a close and immediate way; movies thus became more powerful than stage plays, which were confined to simple sets and viewing at a distance.Movies became extremely popular, and were seen and discussed by so many Americans that a critical mass was created, enabling movies to become a self-supporting part of American culture. Newspapers soon had movie sections, radio programs talked about movies, social clubs developed around movies, and Americans interacted with one another, using movies to compare and express their own ideals, interests, fears, thoughts, and hopes. Before long, it became an assumption and a necessity that people would go regularly to the movies, just as it was later assumed they would buy a car or home.

The studio system was thus very successful in America. The Big Eight studios had profits of $55 million in 1930, then in 1931 profits were $6.2million, and within another year they were losing $26 million[^17]. However, the studios soon recovered, achieving profits of $128.2 million between 1931 and 1940 of which 93.2 million was from Thalberg’s MGM[^18]. Thalberg’s former partner, Louis B. Mayer, who succeeded him as production chief, became the highest salaried American, at $1.3 million a year[^19], thanks to the enormous profitability of the studio system. Movies had struck a strong chord with the American public, to the extent that their function in American society became that of official storyteller. But the so-called Golden Age of movies wasn’t to last.

The movie studios told many quality stories to Americans, grew to enormous size and influence, and thus also dominated the entire entertainment industry. This success won them few friends in the government, which tried to reduce their power, using anti-trust legislation, culminating in 1948 with the Paramount Decrees[^20]. Up until 1948 the five major Hollywood studios had significant theatre chains, which were concentrated into regions. Each studio gave preference the other studios’ theaters at the expense of the far more numerous independent theaters. According to the courts, they acted like a cartel. The studios, some more than others, used techniques to exclude and disadvantage independent exhibitors, such as block booking (where independent exhibitors had to show a studios’ bad movies to get the ones they wanted, usually without seeing them) and clearance control (all theaters were rated by the studios as first run, second run, third run, and the studio’s theaters always got the first-run movies, which were new, of better quality, and therefore the most profitable). These strategies increased the profitability of studios and the theaters they owned, at the expense of non-members.

According to the supreme court the movie studio’s held exclusive dealing arrangements and thus were in violation of anti-trust laws. The court ordered movie production and distribution to be separated from exhibition. The intention was to open the exhibition market to independent producers and distributors, and force all exhibitors to select the movies they would show, based on the movies’ individual merit[^21]. Among the decrees’ many provisions, three major rules were:

 1. Producers and distributors were not allowed to be involved in admission price setting.

 2. They were not allowed to participate in licensing negotiations except on a theater-by-theater and movie-by-movie basis.

 3. No vertical integration was allowed between Paramount defendants and exhibitors[^22].

By separating exhibitors from studios/distributors and forbidding collusion, these rules were supposed to ensure that distributors had no benefit from or influence in a movie’s pricing. Therefore, no exhibitor was subject to block booking and clearance control. As a result, the market became freer.

Simply the Paramount Decrees banned vertical integration in movies and in effect banned the studio system as well. Most products or services have a supply chain of production, distribution, and retail. Vertical integration is a business practice where one company operates throughout the entire supply chain integrating all the elements to bring a product to market. Its opposite is horizontal integration, where one company will dominate one segment of an industry. Vertically integrated companies today include Apple, HBO, and General Motors. Horizontally integrated companies include Wal-Mart, Intel, and Amazon, although most companies are a mixture of both. Banning vertical integration in movies banned a popular management practice, one which developed naturally for the movie business.

The biggest problem with the Paramount Decrees was that television was introduced in the same year as the Decrees were instituted. The entertainment industry was no longer only a movie industry; all those b-level movies that were made and promoted because of studio favoritism, which required block booking to survive and which skewed the market, had outside competition that killed their market because b-level movie production slowly transformed into television production. The movie industry had to adapt to outside competition and a new government-enforced business model at the same time.

Thus, the studio system fell apart. Movie attendance plummeted. In 1946, 58% of Americans went to a movie every week; in 1948, 50% did; by 1952, the figure was 28%, and by 1960, only 18%. In addition to the Paramount Decrees, the studios were losing admissions and hemorrhaging money for four other reasons.

1. In the mid-1940’s American tax law changed, giving independent contractors business tax rates and thus encouraging top actors and directors to become independent contractors, with an advantage over higher taxed salaried and contracted employees, which were the workforce of movie studios[^23]. American tax law essentially took away studios’ specialized workforces.

2. Television brought casual entertainment into every home. Since it was broadcasted and paid with advertisements, television was free to anyone with an antenna.

3. Suburbanization spread throughout America, dispersing the population and increasing the distance between consumer and movie theater. Watching television in a suburban home is more convenient than going to a movie theater.

4. As Americans became richer, they found they could get entertainment from a multitude of consumer items such as jet skis, bowling alleys, and sports cars.

To combat these trends, Hollywood tried several things. The first was to employ its first-rate production ability to make very good movies. Movies such as *The Greatest Show on Earth* (1952), *House of Wax* (1953), *Rear Window* (1954), *Lawrence of Arabia* (1962), *The Sound of Music* (1965), and *Dr. Zhivago* (1965) all proved very successful. Regardless, studio movies soon began to fail, with *Tora, Tora, Tora* (1970), *Hello, Dolly!* (1969), and *Lost Horizon* (1973) leading the way for an industry suddenly doing awful business. A *LIFE* magazine article summed it up thus: “To its horror, Hollywood discovered that old-style movies made in the old-style way had ceased to make money. Once upon a time a money-losing movie was almost impossible.”[^24] Also, as television produced more of its own content, it didn’t need to show movies as often, thus saving the high fees attached to movies[^25].

With nothing left to attract patrons, the studios, unable to control the writing, directing, and acting of movies, turned to spectacle, the last component of storytelling, as noted above. Hollywood could not produce enough marketable pictures consistently enough, couldn’t mobilize exhibitors to create business models to rival television, and most certainly could not counter the massive migration to the suburbs or Americans’ new-found pleasure in consumer items. Cinemascope (widescreen ratio), Technicolor (which most televisions didn’t yet have), and 3D movies were employed to attract audiences, but all failed, and attendance kept going down. In 1960, 18% of Americans were going to the movies once a week, by 1964 it was 10%, and by 1972, it was 8%[^26], where it has roughly stayed since.

The late 1960’s and early 1970’s were desperate times. By 1969, Hollywood studios were losing $200 million annually[^27]. Spectacle was very expensive and it wasn’t working, so the studios turned instead to content. This was the beginning of what is called New Hollywood. The family-oriented stories of the Production Code weren’t appealing to audiences, particularly younger audiences, who, having been raised in the Golden Age of capitalism, didn’t want to experience happy-ending, wholesome stories about lives they were already living. The studios started to employ cheaper directors who wanted to tell gloomy, socially challenging stories, and who wanted to work independently on location, not requiring expensive sets and facilities. Movies such as *Easy Rider* (1969), *The Graduate* (1967), and *M*A*S*H* (1970), were produced. These movies told counter-cultural stories of drug use, sexuality, and anti-heroes. One reviewer, Richard Schickel from *LIFE*, summed up this independence of New Hollywood by saying that “M*A*S*H is what the new freedom of the screen is all about!” Yet these movies, although cheaper to produce, and appealing to younger viewers, still failed to attract larger audiences. Attendance remained flat, although several major successful movies managed to divert from the trend.

The freedom of filmmaking in the New Hollywood allowed filmmakers, usually directors who also co-wrote or co-produced, to make movies that the traditional studio system wouldn’t make, and the new studio system was not capable of making. The rigid sub-division of labor in the studio system was gone. So, the director, who could actually shoot a movie and therefore make a movie on his own, became the new power player. Where the typical studio system directors would envision the script of a writer and work with an experienced cast, crew, and producer, New Hollywood directors were able to capitalize on their ability to film an entire story that existed primarily in their heads. Visionary directors became idolized in moviemaking culture. New Hollywood’s directors became the focal point of moviemaking at the expense of producers, and especially writers. Studio era producers survived until the 1970’s and still contributed to making quality films[^28], but by the late 1980’s the job of producer didn’t require organizing and controlling a quality movie, but simply good politicking to arrange the movie and attract a director and actor, so from a storytelling perspective many producers became, stupid[^29]. While writers were quickly sidelined and advised to “bend over”[^30] in service of the director’s vision[^31]. The fragmented movie industry had no production line, so put a premium on actually making a film, which placed the jobs of producer, and writer far below the director.

However, at the dawn of New Hollywood, the new freedom of directors created many great films. Among them, Francis Ford Coppola’s *The Godfather* (1972) and Apocalypse Now (1979), William Friedkin’s *The Exorcist* (1973), Steven Spielberg’s *Jaws* (1975) and *Close Encounters of a Third Kind* (1977), and George Lucas’s *American Graffiti*(1973) and *Star Wars* (1977) were not only high-quality stories but also immense financial and attendance successes, from which came the name “blockbusters,” reflecting the numbers of people who would stand in line waiting to watch the movie. The new independent filmmakers, on their own, were now contracted by a studio to return a movie, with only a loose idea of what would be produced. The studio’s role was reduced to financing, distributing the movie to theaters[^32], and marketing to the public.

<img src="/src/img/nmm/director_kubrick.jpg" class="kg-image">
<figcaption>The folklore of the movie director being a visionary genius “filmmaker” started during New Hollywood</figcaption>
</figure>

The profits for some of these movies were huge. The production budget for *Star Wars* (1977) was $19 million, and it grossed $460 million at the box-office[^33]. *The Godfather* (1972), made on a budget of $13 million, grossed $47.5 million[^34]. *The Terminator* (1984) was made for $6.4 million and earned $38.3 million[^35]. Moreover, these new blockbusters didn’t require the studio to keep, maintain, and staff expensive sets, production line, and actors. Independent producers originated the ideas, sometimes even received outside funding, and made the movie themselves. The studios just bankrolled the budget, and only sometimes would their own production facilities be used by their own movies. Studios would just wait for the finished product, and then market it to the audience before distributing it to exhibitors[a]. And whereas the studio system had planned years in advance to make new movie for every weekend, depending on its quality to attract people, for mostly unknowable reasons[^36], New Hollywood realized it could just make a sequel. The sequel, prequel, and remake now became common. Hollywood had always retold stories. Humphrey Bogart’s *The Maltese Falcon* (1942) was the third time the novel had been filmed, but studio system remakes were each different, and the official sequel was considered wrong because the story had ended already. *The Godfather Part II* (1974), the first movie to use a “part II” in its name, legitimized the sequel artistically by being nominated for 11 Oscars, and winning six, including Best Picture. Other blockbusters such as *Star Wars* (1977- TBD*)*, *Indiana Jones* (1981–2008), and *Die Hard* (1988–2013) could now have sequels, remakes and prequels without any consumer pushback.

Corporations now began to see the potential in movies. Blockbusters were attracting massive crowds at the box-office. But even more profitable was capturing and capitalizing on the enthusiasm of these crowds. Merchandising, theme parks, novelizations, and broadcast/home video rights all became a part of the business model for movies. 21st Century Fox was purchased by News Corp. Universal by General Electric, Paramount by Gulf and Western then Viacom, Columbia by Sony, and Warner Bros. by Time Warner. Disney became a massive corporation buying up franchises such as Star Wars and Marvel Studios, while MGM, RKO, and United Artists struggled on their own through multiple bankruptcies and sales.

This was the beginning of the blockbuster system in Hollywood. The studios were no longer centers of production, planning a new program of movies years in advance, but were owners of the rights to produce what had become American culture. *Star Wars* (1977-TBD), *Back to the Future* (1985–1990), *The Terminator* (1981-TBD), *Jurassic Park* (1995-TBD), and all other franchise movies, were the business of the studios. Notwithstanding, the studios still released many other non-franchise movies, but these were increasingly either just attempts to make a new franchise or simply purchased from independent producers who offered actors and directors an escape from routine blockbuster filmmaking, and indulged their more artistic “passion project” films. Despite lackluster box office performance, non-franchise films also kept the promotional magazines, reviewers, and newspapers busy while the next franchise movie was waiting to be hyped. Non-franchise movies filled the program of studio releases, but failed to fill the seats of theaters, which accordingly fell on hard times in the 1990’s.

Exhibitors and studios, separated by the Paramount Decrees, now had to agree on how to split theater revenue. That came to mean split revenue based on a scale, with studios getting 80–90% of opening week revenue, then falling back by about 10% each subsequent weekend. Thus, the opening weekend of a movie, especially an expensive blockbuster, was hugely promoted by its studio. Between 50% and 82% of box office revenue is squeezed into the first 10 days. To accommodate the short-lived influx of patrons, exhibitors increased the number of theater screens by 50% over the 1990’s. During that time, however, revenue increased only 16% [^37], because studios couldn’t make enough blockbusters to fill the seats every weekend. Although the new screens were usually new theaters replacing old ones, there was significant cannibalization of market share because of the excess number of screens. In 2000 and 2001, four of the six major American theater chains and several smaller ones (which together operated 30% of the screens in America) filed for bankruptcy[^38].

The blockbuster system didn’t increase weekly movie attendance overall, but attendance at blockbusters, or tent poles, as studios soon began to call them, did increase. However, a sequel or a remake is inherently less interesting to a moviegoer who already knows large segments of the story. Anikan Skywalker was always going to become Darth Vader in *Star Wars* Episode 1–3, for example, whereas Darth Vader killing Obi-Wan in *Star Wars *or being Luke Skywalker’s father in *The Empire Strikes Back* was a major surprise. Franchise movies are more an episode then a full three act story. Quentin Tarantino described this as Hollywood movies telling situations, and not stories, because stories are open to any possibility and surprisingly unfold before an audience, while situations are expected arrangements[^39], such as who will win between the Superhero, and the not so super Supervillain (he always loses, so why is he so super?). So, to maintain interest in retold movies, studios used spectacle.

Just as the movie industry reverted to spectacle in desperate times in the 1950’s and 1960’s, so too it used spectacle to sell routine and repetitive stories in the blockbuster system. Hence, today we have ever more computer-generated special effects, 3D movies, movie theater seats that shake (D-Box), ever more sexual content, more horrific horror, much more hype and gossip by Entertainment Tonight, massive marketing campaigns that filter throughout our entire society, and unremitting attention to movie stars. For an example of this change, consider the increase in shots per movie, which measures how fast-paced it is. Dialogue scenes have less need for cuts than do action scenes. Slow, well-written, prodding scenes, which build suspense or drama, require fewer shots than chase and fight scenes. A movie made between 1930 and 1960 averaged 300–500 shots. Today, movies average 1,200 shots, and action movies require 3,000+ shots[40]. More shots allow more action and therefore more spectacle, which take precedence over the writing or storytelling value that movies once needed to have[b].

Increasingly, then, movies became predominantly blockbusters and franchise sequels, prequels, or remakes. The studios were no longer production centers where writing departments were filled with talented and skilled people who literally scoured the earth looking for new story ideas (among requirements for writers at MGM were speaking two languages, reading two newspapers a day to keep movies relevant, and constantly writing their own stories[^41]), but simply financiers who owned the rights to make and distribute the stories that Americans considered their culture. There were no more stories to tell, but stories to be re-told. The value of distribution rights depended on limited video storage technology to control the movie distribution from theatre, to VHS/DVD, and then to television. Once video storage technology increased it empowered the consumer to consumer ever more with DVD burning, and internet downloading. With this change the temporary and profitable sweet-spot of limited video distribution for Hollywood ended too.

# Where Did the Good Stories Go

The writing and directing, and the vertically integrated production, distribution, and exhibition system of the studios did develop again when television came to the fore. Television studios, in total control of their product, could thus plan stories years in advance; by contrast, producers of films would not know if their movie would even get shown in theaters. For example, *Star Wars* was received so badly by exhibitors that none would show it. Fox had to use block booking illegally to get just 32 theaters to show the movie (the carrot was a movie called *The Other Side of Midnight*).

Television slowly grew into what the studio system had become. Producers oversaw teams of writers, directors, editors, production crew, and so on. Whereas the movies became a place for visionary directors telling their own stories without much oversight or control, television had the entire story production process under control. For example, many people will know who directed *Avatar* (2009) or *The Hobbit* (2012), but hardly anyone will be familiar with the name of the director of *The Sopranos* (1999–2007) or *Breaking Bad* (2008–2013). *The Sopranos* and *Game of Thrones* is, in the consumer’s eyes, first and foremost an HBO production; movies were once perceived in the same way, because the studios produced and exhibited their own movies and constituted a brand.Television started in the same way as movies had, by telling simple serial or episodic stories that replaced the b-level movies of the studio system. As time went on, television, especially HBO original’s programming in the late 1990’s, began presenting very well-made stories. HBO started the trend of premium cable programming that Showcase, Starz, USA Network, FX, FOX, and others worked hard to emulate. HBO is still the best, and it resembles MGM in its origins and the way it perfected the system of telling high-quality stories.

<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide">
<img src="/src/img/nmm/hbo-modern-MGM.jpg" class="kg-image">
<figcaption>HBO is the modern MGM</figcaption>
</figure>

HBO’s success is remarkable. Financially, culturally, and artistically, it has proven that excellent stories can sell today. It is the MGM of television “For more than a decade, it has lavished good, smart product on its viewers, and in the process raised the entire industry’s creative game.” The rest of television responded, and obscure channels such as Showtime, AMC, Starz, FX, and USA Network produce shows such as *Mad Men*, *Suits*, *The Walking Dead*, and *Sons of Anarchy*. As a result, “in a sense the entire industry has won. Talent is migrating from the broadcast networks and film to pay-TV. Showtime has been able to build series around skilled actors. HBO has mostly bet on writers. In high-end television, writers can aspire to a level of control, as ‘showrunners’ and producers, that eludes them in cinema.”[^42] HBO does what the studio system used to, namely tell good stories and rely on their quality to attract viewers. HBO gives its shows time to find success, and often orders a second season the day the first premieres, in effect telling the audience and the writers that it’s okay to get invested in these stories[^43]. HBO unifies all the aspects of storytelling Aristotle noted, is vertically integrated a producer, distributor and exhibitor, and has thus developed a brand that consumers love to watch.

The lesson here is function. Society likes and needs stories and has since before the time of Aristotle. Whoever tells good, serious stories relevant to the audience with well-constructed plots and believable characters with whom the viewer can empathize, will find success. Whereas movies used to represent society to itself, now they are instead used to draw in revenue from marketing, theme rides, television/streaming rights, and merchandising.

This is where movies are today: a well-established medium controlled by corporations that own the right to produce popular American stories, whose continual sequels, prequels, and remakes maintain consumer interest by resorting to spectacle. This is because a series of decrees from 1948 forbade movie producers and distributors from coordinating and collaborating with exhibitors. Despite a fall in weekly patronage from 60% to 8%, massive growth in television that killed the b-movies who needed block booking and blind bidding the Paramount Decrees were meant to stop, massive growth in consumerism that competes against movies as leisure, and a high level of suburbanization, movies are still subject to a 1948 court ruling that forbids vertical integration, a very common business practice. One study observes that, “Few industries have experienced the same degree of antitrust scrutiny and litigation as the motion picture industry.”[^44] This anti-trust scrutiny prevents writers, directors, and producers from organizing to tell well-structured, whole stories, in the way that television has so successfully done, to the delight of the public.

# The Problem

I have had only one job in the movie industry, that of usher/projectionist. As a projectionist, I was the only person who observed the audience watching the movie, every movie, at every show time — and I saw that most audiences were disappointed. The spectacle that movies had become was enough to draw people to the theaters, sometimes in large numbers, but when in their seats, rarely were patrons laughing during a comedy, or apprehensive during a suspense scene, or crying while watching a tragedy. Audience investment in the storylines of most movies doesn’t happen that often because plot and character are neglected, and these are required to get emotional responses from viewers. When talking about movies today, people often ask something like, “Are you going to watch *Transformers* 4?”, rather than, “You watch *Game of Thrones* last night too: wait, tell David why he’s gotta start watching it…?” The intense crowd reaction to *Game of Thrones’* Red Wedding rarely happen in movie theatres because spectacle cannot arouse strong emotions’. Also too few people now watch movies at the same time, so discussions about them are unlikely. Americans still discuss movies, but usually it’s because of the massive and misleading hype of an impending release, or because of the awards and festival season and its accompanying obsessive media coverage based on fashion or celebrity love lives, rarely because friends shared an emotional experience.

### What story would you rather tell?

(play both at the same time)

<iframe width="700" height="393" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Apc8OU98r54" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

So, movie attendance has stagnated at about 8% of the population. Despite all the adulation that movies and their stars receive, people seldom visit movie theaters. In 2009 the best picture Oscar went to the *The Hurt Locker* (2009), yet only two million Americans had actually seen the movie at the time[^45]; by contrast, 52 million watched the Oscar award ceremony that year. *Avatar* (2009) was proclaimed a wild success because of its massive gross, yet if considered in terms of theater attendance (and not even relative to population size), it’s the about the 30th most watched movie in history[^46]. *The Social Network* (2010) was the top-ranking movie in the country during its first week because it grossed $30.5 million. Yet it had only 3.5 million viewers in an entire week in both the USA and Canada[^47]. By comparison, one episode of *Modern Family *gets about 10 million viewers in the US alone[^48]. *The Social Network*’s marketing slogan was, “You Don’t Get to 500 Million Friends Without Making a Few Enemies.” Ironic, because one also doesn’t attain critical mass with 3.5 million viewers in a market of about 360 million people (total theater attendance for the week in which *The Social Network *topped the list at number 1 was around 11.3 million people, about 4% of the population)[c]. The automatic attention movies receive in mass media is similar to that of automobiles, where every supposed new model, increases in chrome, DVD players, horsepower and size; in short all the spectacle used to attract consumers to what is equivalent to a movie sequel (a supposed new model car), is simply out of habit. Regardless of the habitual attention during trade shows, releases, marketing, and reviews, GM who especially relied heavily on SUV’s[[^49]] spectacle still went bankrupt. And studio’s market value today depends heavily on the “willingness and ability of buyers to pay a premium for access to a glamorous world”[^50]. And glamour depends on lasting social attention. Fading social attention will lead to bankruptcy.

Mass audiences for movies are a thing of the past. Movie interest today is a nostalgic memory of the former glory of the movie industry, maintained by an old-economy news media that need to attract viewership or readership but don’t really care if people patronize the movie theater. Movies do not function as society’s storytellers anymore. I do not know what percentage of the American public should be viewing a movie each week in order to sustain the industry, but it is definitely more than 8%. And, regardless of any impulse to point to DVDs, Blu-rays, higher 3D admission pricing, or even Netflix, if movies aren’t being viewed in a theater, the medium is dying.

The Challenge for HollywoodThis is because the movies *are* the movie theater. There is no lasting substitute. A well told story is an immersive story, the more immersive the experience of watching a story, the better the story. Theaters are designed to watch stories, and thus enhance the product greatly. Go to a movie theater and you see the movie with no interruptions or distractions from phone calls, kids, or emails, in the way a movie should be watched, allowing it to absorb you totally throughout. Moreover, as you are forced to pay to watch a movie at a theater, you tend to enjoy the product more, and you also experience the movie communally, rather than in your own small world. Further, the business aspect is that movie theaters bring money into the industry through concession sales. In short, a movie should be watched *at the* *movies*.

Getting their head out of their sand. Hollywood knows that attendance in the theater is nowhere near pre-television levels. The DVD was an especially big boost to Hollywood during the 1990’s and 2000’s, because consumers paid $20–30 to watch a movie. But that windfall was always going to be temporary. Even with it, however, the theater was and still is pivotal, because, regardless of low attendance, the theatre still creates the impression of success in the minds of Americans. A movie that flops in the theaters only rarely achieves success later on. For example, the price Netflix pays for a movie is highly correlated with its success in the theaters[^51]. Thus, although the movie theater is still being used to spawn movie franchises, it has lost much of its ability to create cultural success. Modern Hollywood has trouble creating enthusiasm for new movies. Before we discuss how to begin restoring society’s interest in movies, we will discuss why Hollywood’s current business model is wrong.

The Hollywood business model is wrong because it provides a poor customer experience. It’s a real pain to be a consumer of Hollywood’s product. As a consequence of the Paramount Decrees, moviemaking today is highly fragmented, with too many interests, none of which concentrate on the consumer.

Let’s start with production. The production of movies today is mainly done through independent production companies, all vying (usually very aggressively) for the limited financing on offer (from studios, sometimes banks, or anyone who will give money; for example, the Coen brothers’ first movie *Blood Simple* [1984] was financed by dentists). To win financial support, each production needs to convince the financier that their movie will be watched by the public. Producers do this by creating enthusiasm, called “buzz” in the industry, to attract “hot” actors or directors who will garner attention from the press. A typical success scenario is fueled by the hopes and prayers of individuals who are all freelancers. If they find work, it’s on a per picture basis, with no contract to protect themselves. So writers write a screenplay, usually solo sometimes in pairs, hoping a producer will read it. The producer buys a script, hoping a star will commit to it. The star commits, hoping that a studio will fund it. The studio funds it, and hopes their contracted director will not mess it up. The distributor hopes its marketing will attract people. Everyone prays people will see the film. However, since no one has ever really known what will succeed at the box office, everyone involved in a movie tries to protect themselves by lining up their next job based on the speculation that their current movie will be the next big hit. The level of positive buzz of the impending release determines the quality of their next job. If there is not enough, the process starts over. Movie industry people thus live twenty four hours a day inside the beating pulse of industry speculation by obsessing over industry magazine’s the *Daily Variety*, the *Hollywood Reporter *and the *National Enquirer[^52]*, because the industry runs on speculation equivalent to a gold rush- which literally came true. In 2010 “futures” speculated box-office performances were to be traded on the Minneapolis Grain Exchange alongside wheat and corn[^53]. It received regulatory approval, and another exchange in New York was about to as well [^54], but lobbying from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) had it banned because the real world prices set on future box-office performances would counter the imaginary marketing hype Hollywood lives on.

There is therefore much aggression between jobs in movie making. Co-workers see each other as competitors and often will not help or pass on information such as better techniques to their rivals. This is because there too many workers, trying to get too little work. In 1995, 173 speculative, “spec”, scripts sold in Hollywood, in 2010 55 did, and in 2011 119 sold[^55]. No one tracks how many scripts are written each year by aspiring screenwriters, but the Writers Guild of America West has about 12,000 members[^56]. Script magazine weekly newsletter has over 200,000 recipients[^57]. There are about 160,000 members of America’s Screen Actors Guild and American Federation of Television and Radio Artists[^58]. The union doesn’t release how many are actors but a majority likely are, and with many non-union actors and with just 599 movies released in 2011 in America[^59] (only 150 from the top ten studio’s) it’s understandable why hundreds of actors arrive for open casting calls. With so many hopeful film workers and so little open spots, the level of competition in Hollywood is so fierce one Oscar winning producer epitomized it by saying “the only time I’ll root for anybody to be a success is if he or she has cancer, and I know for certain that the cancer is terminal.”[^60] Moreover, these individual workers (if the workers are lucky) are assembled and organized by agents working on commission, whose main motive is to make a high sale and get as many of their people on the project, not to produce the best possible movie. This high worker competitiveness exists in television too, especially when a pilot television show tries to get selected for production, but when after being selected television show production is not nearly as panicked because workers have contracts and can be on air for years. Television is also not as sought after or glamourous as movies. In the absence of a studio tent pole blockbuster, or a very successful actor or director such as Leonardo DiCaprio or George Clooney whose stardom somewhat disables the need for speculation, most movies are produced in a climate of huge uncertainty known as “development hell”, which explains why movie quality, filled with talented and hardworking people, falls far behind premium television programming.

Just as the production of movies ignores the patron by neglecting quality, so too the exhibitors actively seek to limit consumer choice. According to the Paramount Decrees, exhibitors decide which movies they will show on a per movie basis[^61]. However, since studios do not compete against each other’s opening weekends, there are few movies to choose from, and exhibitors effectively share blockbusters, a practice known as splitting[^62], which is illegal but hard to prove. Exhibitors also demand minimum distance separation between theaters showing the same movie[^63], often further limiting patrons to one theater. All of this means the patron is continually denied choice and the benefits of competition.

The main task for movie distributors is to market the movie, with a heavy emphasis on the opening weekend. The massive hype generated can attract enormous crowds, 28% of *Spider-Man* (2002) gross came from its opening weekend (*Spider-Man* accounted for 70% of the total weekend box office), while it was 45% (with 80% of the total weekend box office) for *Spider-Man 3* (2007)[^64], but this same hype also often discloses large parts of the story, twists, surprises, funniest jokes, etc., so depriving the movie of any capacity to surprise. Also the society is not able to build its own enthusiasm for stories they like. For example, *The Hangover* (2009) had 38% of its domestic gross within the first 10 days, *The Hangover II* (2011) had 73% of its gross within 10 days. Both *Hangover’s *made about the same gross, meaning there was a lot less naturally occurring social enthusiasm for the second *Hangover*, conversations, arguments, recounting the story over beers, shared laughs, etc. because the business practice of Hollywood is to artificially build enthusiasm through marketing before a movie opens to get as many people into the opening weekend as possible. The success of this one weekend will define the success of the movie. However, regardless of its performance, the movie continues through the same sequence of events: a theatrical run, then a period of withdrawal from the marketplace, then more marketing to hype the VHS, then DVD, and now Blu-ray release, followed by another withdrawal, until finally TV rights and streaming rights are auctioned off. If really successful, a movie will generate theme park rides, merchandising, and the likelihood of a follow-up movie, which traditionally has less success at the box-office when judged against the cost to produce the movie. Using *Spider-Man* again, the production budget was 34% of the domestic box-office gross for *Spider-Man 1*, while it was 54% for *Spider-Man 2* (2004), 77% of *Spider-Man 3* (2007), and 88% for the remake *The Amazing Spider-Man* (2011). These lowering returns and box-office performance are why movie’s revenue stream after the movie theatre is so important. Technology advancements of faster internet and larger storage means the revenue stream was never going to last.

So Hollywood increases prices. The customer is not only denied quality and competition but also an affordable box office ticket. This is again because of the diverging interests of the fragmented movie industry. Officially, exhibitors are free to set prices, but the distributors won’t license their movies to theaters with low prices[^65]. The heavy slant toward blockbusters means prices have to remain high and uniform; otherwise patrons would have an incentive not to watch blockbusters. This enforces a uniform pricing regime, which, however, is based on no sound economic justification[^66]. To see the seasonal shift in movie attendance look at the below graph of Google searches for “movie show times” in the United States, in 2012:

Furthermore, since the exhibitors get less revenue from admission prices, and none from DVDs and other downstream sources, they compensate by increasing concession prices, which accounted for 20% of revenue but 40% of profits for US exhibitors in 2000[^68]. One exhibitor observed, “Selling food is my job. I just happen to work at a movie theater.”[^69] The movie industry is two segmented interests in the same product financially exploit their mutual customer.Thus despite the above market fluctuations in movies, prices never vary within the year, season, or even between movies. Compare that to say baseball tickets where customer interest, and therefore ticket prices, changes because of the opposing team, home team performance, and when the game is played, either what time of day, day of the week, or in the season.

Thus the divergent interests of the movie industry provide the customer with a poor product and an even worse deal for their money. The movies cost too much. Integrating the movie industry into a single interest, and allowing integrated companies to control quality and price, as premium television does today, will rescue the industry by making the movie theater again the focus for its efforts and the chief means of making money.

Although not directly responsible for financial success, the movie theater still creates success by placing a movie either in or out of American culture. The movie theater remains the gate to American culture. However, the financial success of a movie no longer derives from ticket sales but from selling rights to view the movie later on. Thus, Hollywood is very sensitive to threats to its revenue stream. Hollywood leads the expansion of copyright, which now offers 95 years of protection[^70], while patent protection lasts for 20 years. Hollywood greatly fears piracy, which the MPAA calls “the biggest threat to the US motion picture industry.”[^71] Piracy consists of buying burned DVDs, or the more common downloading off the internet. The MPAA leads attempts to fight downloading, having recently lent its support to the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), which failed after the public and most technology giants resisted it. However, it is the mentality of the MPAA that is failing, not its legislation. If digital technology can allow huge Computer Generated Imagery, turn film projectors into digital projectors, allow films to be downloaded to digital projectors (saving lots of money compared to film prints), lets production and digital effects houses transfer terabytes of data across the world, offer thousands of hours of free content upload and downloading on YouTube, if Facebook and Google are free to use, if the Appstore and Google Play provide hundreds of thousands of free apps and games, there’s little reason to think the consumer of these products would then pay $10-$19 to watch one movie at a theatre, or $20-$30 to buy one Blu-Ray from a store. Technology has finally enabled movie patrons to watch cheap, reliable, and plentiful home streaming, whether legally or not. This is the massive change to which the modern movie studio has yet to adapt.

Here is a Google Trends chart that displays how ignorant the movie industry is to the public’s demands. The below chart shows how often the American public searched for each term “Torrent” for illegal downloading, and “Netflix”, for legal downloading.

The American public just wanted to watch stories at a price they could afford, and when presented with the option to pay a reasonable price, they did. Now compare interest in movie theatres.

More Americans were interested in a car wash then the movie theatre while watching Netflix more every year. And yet during this time period the movie industry blames Americans stealing movies for its problems. This is obstinate. This is insulting too. It is also poetic that the salvation of the industry was using the digital technology it helped create with the huge burst in spectacle filmmaking in the 1980’s and 1990’s. It just took an outsider, Netflix, to use it[d]. The movie industry’s dated mentality is much like the automobile industry who did not use technological development to make automobiles safer, cheaper and more efficient and therefore more mobile, as Tesla is doing, but instead used modern technology to create more spectacle with supposed “all-new” yearly vehicles, more horsepower, chrome, gadgets and gimmicks, epitomized by the SUV.

And, whether or not individuals pay for digital delivery, the movie studios today depend on consumers not having the option to stream movies at home. The $8.00 a month for Netflix is minuscule in comparison to the $20 movie ticket or $30 per Blu-ray the industry expects the public to pay. At the same time as Netflix has become so popular with consumers, with 24 million subscribers in 2011, up from 15 million in 2010, the studios are still trying to charge the consumer more. Currently they are testing a $30 dollar pay per view home viewing service, supposedly justified because the movie is still showing in theaters[^72]. The movie industry can’t see the American public can’t afford that price. They industry can’t see that their prices need to come down to safe itself.

It’s great Netflix showed that digital technology is good for storytelling, but is still only a partial solution. Stories should be shared experiences. This price premium mentality is similar to the mentality that permeated the music industry. That industry, which also was greatly reliant on CD sales as Hollywood was on DVD sales, failed when Napster and then iTunes came along and gave the consumer greater control and power. So too download speeds have increased to allow ever easier video streaming. The music industry eventually bowed to the inevitable and stopped depending on CD sales, in the face of technological development that brought vinyl records and CD’s, followed by .mp3 and file sharing as well. Having now begun to adapt, the industry has starting making money again from live performances. As *The Economist *noted, “Live performance, once mostly a means of promoting records and CDs, now props up the music business. The rise of illicit file-sharing and single-track downloading, which is much less profitable than selling albums, has prodded musicians to tour more often and raise ticket prices. Venues have smartened up, introducing innovations such as cold beer and clean toilets. Last year, in the teeth of recession (2009), fans paid a record $4.4 billion to attend concerts in North America.”[^73] The movie industry should follow this lead, concentrating on the movie theater because it’s a lot harder to steal a movie seat than a digital file. As has already been argued, the theater returns the patron to the best place to view a movie. Thus, the movie industry should improve the storytelling experience of the moviegoer by showing fewer sequels and “passion project” art films, undertake less marketing, and offer cheaper tickets (which will be purchased more often) and food, and drinks for a professional entertainment show brought to the masses. Instead of the ever more movie spectacle, at a higher price, which is the same mentality that drove GM into bankruptcy.

Once the movie theater is returned to the heart of the movie business, then production can return to the organized, professional creativity that defined the studio system, and which now defines the artistically and financially successful HBO. All this needs to take place under the vertical integration that is wrongfully banned by the Paramount Decrees.

# The Fleeting Spectacle of the Movies

It is impossible for movies today to emulate HBO. Creating properly told stories depends on unification of the production, distribution, and exhibition of the story. However, the present system is best described as a spectacle system dominated by franchise movies, independent films, marketing, and the technology of 3D, IMAX, and D-Box.

Spectacle is also increasingly expensive. Like a reshown magic trick, a spectacle can, after all, last only so long. Eventually the trick that attracts attention grows old, and if interest is to be maintained, further spectacle is required. The franchise movies therefore maintain interest by continuously increasing their production and marketing budgets. For example, compare the growth in production budgets below. Please note however that reported production budgets are easily skewed because of financing deals, payment deals, and accounting techniques[e]. Franchises are thus used here for easier comparison of the growth ratio.

<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide">
<img src="/src/img/nmm/budgets-returns.png" class="kg-image">
<figcaption>Returns on spectacle https://cloud.highcharts.com/show/ejyteka</figcaption>
</figure>

Spectacle is required to attract public attention and interest. As these franchise movies become more repetitive, actors and directors seek escape in the independent films shown at Sundance, Cannes, Toronto and other film festivals. Actor- and director-driven, such art movies are skewed toward the character element of storytelling. When movies have a strongly written plot, the plot naturally becomes more important and doesn’t allow an actor to overact, or a director to overshoot the story. Art films are thus not complete stories with the clear plots that most moviegoers need in order to become immersed in the story; hence, independent movies are rarely very successful with the American public. Many are produced but never actually purchased by a distributor and never released in theatres. The current system, embodying these two strands of franchise movies and independent films[^74], is, however, so ingrained it’s built into the industry[^75]. Actors and directors refer to it as “one for me, one for them”, meaning for every spectacle movie an actor or director makes, he will get the prestige and clout to get the artistic freedom for a studio green light for their vision of a passion project. Gore Verbinksi made *Pirates of the Caribbean* (2003), then *The Weatherman* (2005), Ang Lee made *The Hulk* (2003), then made *Brokeback Mountain*(2005) [^76], Matt Damon made *The Bourne Series* (2002–2007), then made *Gerry* (2002) and *The Informant!* (2009) Susan Sarandon made *Enchanted* (2007), the made *Middle of Nowhere* (2008). Kristin Stewart made the Twilight series (2008–2012), so could make *The Runaways* (2010) and *The Yellow Handkerchief* (2010). At times the art films can find success with the public, or the spectacle movie can be well made, however the overriding predisposition of both is to be art and spectacle first, leaving the mass public with either unappealing art, or intellectually boring spectacle. Since they are mutually supporting, both are part of the same spectacle system.

<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide">
<img src="/src/img/nmm/art_films_1.png" class="kg-image">
<figcaption>I wonder what blurs the reality?</figcaption>
</figure>

Inflation and other factors account for a small part of the budget increases. Although not all movies are so expensive, and some, like *Memento* (2001), *300* (2006) and *District 9* (2009), can be produced cheaper by being innovative in their writing and direction and using cheaper actors, most movies have to step up the degree of spectacle of more effects, and more “hot” actors and directors, all of whose expense raises the production costs for everyone. Between 1993 and 1997 for example production costs grew by 78%[^78] for all movies.

Now compare the budgets for cable television original programming. The first season of *Game of Thrones* with 10 hours of product cost $60[^79] to $100 million[^80], *Mad Men* cost about $39 million a season, and *Breaking Bad* runs to $3 million per episode[^81]. Why else does a movie require so much more money than a well-written drama, if not for the need to generate spectacle? Moreover, the spectacle system is already financially broken. It does not pay for itself, and has been subsidized for years. Since movie making can happen most anywhere, many state and national governments have enticed movie makers to their shores by offering tax credits. The more money that is saved through tax credits, the more money can be spent on spectacle, creating an ever faster race to outspend the previous movie. In 2009, in the US, 43 states offered film tax credits, and they worked so well that between 2003 and 2008, California, which did not offer subsidies, went from producing two-thirds of big-studio movies to one-third. In the light of the current and future financial crisis, this trend should cause concern, because, as *The Economist* notes, “With banks and hedge funds virtually out of the game, state governments are now the most important external source of funding in the film business.”[^82] However, the studios do not just like this “free” money, studios unequivocally need it to subsidize their business model and attract customers with expensive spectacle.

<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide">
<img src="/src/img/nmm/spectacle-returns.png" class="kg-image">
<figcaption>Vanishing returns http://cloud.highcharts.com/show/abykyqe</figcaption>
</figure>

And just as the production requires spectacle, so do the distribution and exhibition of movies. Distributors heavily advertise movie premieres. Marketing budgets nowadays sometimes equal production budgets. Average marketing costs increased 58% between 1993 and 1997[^83].

Exhibitors also think that the future of their business lies in spectacle — alternative content (showing non-movie content at the movie theater, such as football games and music concerts), as well as building specialty theaters which integrate bowling alleys, circus like arcades and such into the theater, and making use of new technology such as 3D and the D-Box, a theater seat that shakes. Alternative content lets a theater expand its customer options, but a movie theater will always be a movie theater. Specialty theaters tend to charge high premiums for their services, accentuating the squeeze on their finances that theatergoers already feel. As for new technologies such as 3D and D-Box, their rationale is not to improve the story, but to distract from a bad one. The content of the movie is so poor that movie patrons now don’t shake in their seats because they are emotionally involved in an electrifying story, but because they are being forced to by an electric motor. This is the exact opposite to the purpose of a movie, to tell an emotionally engaging story.

Remember however, spectacle, as Aristotle noted, is an entirely valid feature of storytelling. Whether it is the extravagant décor of *Moulin Rouge!* (2003), the amazing visual effects of *Avatar* (2009), or *The Dark Knight*(2008) shot in engrossing IMAX, a spectacle can be an amazing experience. However, today spectacle is far passed over used to have the impact on viewers it otherwise should. Few people ever cared what special effects were found in the plays of Sophocles or what kind of chairs Shakespeare put in the Globe Theatre, because content of stories is far more important than spectacle. In the long run, in this industry as in the automobile, spectacle kills.

# Fixing Movies

## The Past is the Future

The solution is vertical integration, allowing the producer and distributor to coordinate with the retailer of the product. This business model is followed throughout the business world, and it was only the massive success of movies, not any rational reasons, that saw it banned. Apple is allowed to open retail stores, Wal-Mart coordinates heavily with producers and has a store brand, Disney can open theme-parks, manufacture dolls based on its characters and can have a television channel but cannot control its stories inside a movie theatre, HBO was an exhibitor that became a producer, just as Netflix is now doing (interestingly, it was movie exhibitors who bought and formed the first studios, which later became production-centric). How vertical integration will be adopted by the industry is impossible to know, but the Paramount Decrees are an antiquated legal agreement that were thought up when television wasn’t even around, and they have no reason to exist today.

Vertical integration will increase movie theater attendance. Historically, the best way to increase movie attendance has been to lower the price of a ticket[^84]. It seems very obvious, but the industry has not caught on to the fact because they deny prices are too expensive. The MPAA says, “Going out to the movies is one of the most affordable and most popular forms of entertainment.”[^85] Similarly, *BoxOffice *magazine says, “Ticket prices are a bargain.”[^86] According to the industry, the average ticket price in 2011 was $7.93[^87], but this figure is an average of available tickets, not the average price of purchased tickets[^88]. Thus, the industry figure is skewed, as it takes child prices, senior prices, matinee prices, and regular prices into the calculation of an average ticket.

<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide">
<img src="/src/img/nmm/applestore.jpg" class="kg-image">
<figcaption>This is illegal for movies</figcaption>
</figure>

In American culture, the movies are not considered cheap. When looking online, I found the national average ticket price closer to $10–12, and 3D and IMAX shows priced at $15–19, making the average ticket per person $10–19 before travel and concession costs are factored in. *Overdrive *magazine, a trucking magazine, suggests that a trucker can save money simply by not going to the movies, which the magazine regards as a money trap[^89]. One study found the total cost per movie per person to be as high as $50 because of parking and childcare.[^90]

Industry-reported ticket prices are a façade put up by an industry that actively discourages competition, and enforces uniform pricing to encourage the viewing of blockbuster movies as a gateway into merchandising, theme rides and a sequel. Although this may seem ridiculous, the industry has, in practice, no other choice. It is illegal to coordinate pricing, so they are forced to have uniform pricing for all movies, regardless of supply and demand. One study explained the viability of the staggered pricing at each movie theater, and found “transition to variable pricing would likely benefit exhibitors and patrons, suggesting also that, “a move toward variable pricing would be an improvement for the industry.”[^91] Moreover, the cheaper a movie is, the less it depends on spectacle and more on plot and character, the larger the audience for movies will become because instead of depending on one franchise movie to attract consumers, multiple high quality movies will attract a more diverse clientele. Consider the success of movies that were open during *Avatar*’s run in theaters.

<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide">
<img src="/src/img/nmm/ticket-price-weekend.png" class="kg-image">
<figcaption>Same weekend http://cloud.highcharts.com/show/agebyci</figcaption>
</figure>

All of these movies had to charge the same price at the theater as *Avatar *2D, with a production budget of between $280 and 400 million[^93]. Avatar could not compete against the cheaper prices of other movies. Being unable to lower their prices, the movies above did less well than their quality should have suggested. Left alone, the industry will not solve this.

During the aforementioned dip in theatre attendance, in the early 2000’s the movie industry by and large advocated for 3D filmmaking to reverse the trend. It was thought since 3D (at the time) couldn’t be replicated at home it would attract moviegoers while also improving storytelling. It hasn’t worked because 3D was adopted (perhaps unwittingly) to increase the spectacle of movies. In 2011 early 3D advocate Jeffrey Katezenburg, CEO of Dreamworks Animation, blamed poor quality 3D movies for their inability to attract moviegoers[^94]. Yet by 2013, four years after 3D trendsetter *Avatar* displayed 3D’s possibilities and most major movies being released in 3D, the share of viewers choosing 3D over 2D has declined. One investment review said in 2013 “We have become increasingly concerned that these lower levels will actually represent the norm going forward versus a recent exception as consumers are likely to remain increasingly choosy with 3D premiums”[^95]. Consider as well, The Economist recently noted that success in film is based, not on storytelling or value for money, but is all about having vast intellectual property rights, access to emerging markets, and lavish spending[^96]. 3D is a continuation of the spectacle system. Even if 3D can improve storytelling, by perhaps developing into a genre like Film Noir did, moviemakers should figure out how before rolling 3D out to the public en masse. The reader can determine if 3D movies have been more successful then cheaper quality stories such as *Game of Thrones, Downtown Abby, The Big C, Homeland, Suits, *or *Boardwalk Empire* in creating enthusiasm amongst their viewers by noting which stories, Hollywood movies or premium television, create more Facebook updates, twitter updates, and water cooler talks in their daily lives.

The answer for everyone we ask is quality stories. How can 3D, D-Box, blockbuster sequels, the entire spectacle system be what the audience wants, if shows like *The Simpsons, South Park, Robot Chicken, Family Guy, *and*Archer* are so popular with the generation who if anyone should be avoiding simple cartons for the spectacle at the movie theatre, would be, but are not. People like and need quality stories, not spectacle. Much of the motivation of this writer to write this book has been the daily comedic juxtaposition of movie’s grandiose marketing and glamour with the decline of daily conversation around movies in the real world; the conscious admiration of movies by the public, with our simultaneous subconscious disregard of it. An adoring entertainment interviewer calling someone a movie star with a gleam on their face as if looking into an actual star, while few in the public has seen the actors several last movies is a comedy that needed an explanation. Movie’s decline isn’t temporary or because of an inability to use 3D effectively. There is a structural inability for the American movie industry to produce quality entertainment cheap enough to re-attract moviegoers.

When asking for help with a policy paper on tax credits In October 2006, I asked an editor of *BoxOffice*magazine about the reintegration of the industry along the lines proposed here. Her response, typical of how vertical integration is perceived within the industry, was:
>Your question about the possibility of studios once again having a controlling hand in the exhibition sector is one that has come up from time to time, and as you know from your research, that form of ownership is largely prohibited because of the 1948 ruling by the Supreme Court. And, as you also know, the decision was based on the notion that vertical integration under the old Hollywood studio system was in violation of antitrust laws. That notion is still widely accepted and is the reason why production/distribution houses and movie theaters remain separate businesses.
> 
>Your argument that vertical integration would actually improve competition (in terms of product with lower budgets being given a more level playing field, so to speak) is an interesting one, but the industry is highly unlikely to return to that model for many reasons. Having covered the exhibition side, I would say that theater operators feel that production houses/distributors already have too much say in where product is unfurled (it’s sort of an open secret that studios strike more favorable deals with theater chains that have more desirable sites in terms of markets and neighborhoods within those markets, etc.). Exhibitors have also argued for years that producers/distributors fare far better in terms of admissions because of standard box office splits (believed to be as high as 90%/distribs to 10%/exhibs on opening weekend), so ceding any more power to the other side is, to put it mildly, a longshot.

Phrases like “ceding power,” “already have too much say,” “believed to be as high” and “the other side” do not exactly represent a team mentality that inspires faith in the possibility of a reversal of the movie industry’s strategy. More importantly, it is just an assumption that, after over 60 years of massive technological and social change, vertical integration is still regarded as anti-trust and damages the industry. It is an assumption because, after the legal line was drawn, two opposing forces were created, and movies became structured in a way diametrically opposed to vertical integration. This in turn means being diametrically opposed to telling well told stories.

# Pixar versus Directeur

In the motor industry, Ford did not follow GM into bankruptcy. It escaped this fate because its new CEO, Alan Mulally, who came from outside the industry in 2006, quickly saw the need for an automobile manufacturer to return to function and concentrate on mobility. So, Ford started selling smaller, more efficient automobiles[^97]that were more functional forms of transportation. Ford also took low-interest loans from banks, because they knew the short-term profits of the SUV were soon ending, and those banks also realized that Ford’s new vision made economic sense. Moviemakers should follow suit, in the sense of becoming more functional tellers of stories. Just as automobile manufacturers have dealerships and showrooms, so too movie studios should be allowed to exhibit and control their own product. Only then will the movie theater return to its former glory, providing excellent entertainment, such as entertaining pre-shows, double features, live performances, and high-quality storytelling movies, a professionally assembled night of entertainment at an affordable price that cannot be replicated at home. The automotive innovator Bob Lutz commented on the American automobile’s industry decline by writing a book called “*Car Guys vs. Bean Counters: The Battle for the Soul of American Business*”, where he mainly comments on how many business minded American auto industry leaders simply didn’t know or care about bringing quality cars to the American public. The so-called bean counters concentrated on marketing and cost cutting production to sell their ever larger, and less reliable automobiles. The movie industry should be led by showmen and entertainers, not marketing executives and celebrities. There are thousands of hours of movies the modern patron hasn’t seen, many from foreign producers, such as *City of God* (2002), *Goodbye Lenin!* (2003), and *The Lives of Others* (2006), as well as old movies such as *Rebecca*(1940), *The Treasure of the Sierra Madre* (1948), *The Quiet Man* (1952) and *The Apartment* (1960). All of these could be mixed by professional showmen and storytellers with live performances, short films, or the huge variety of humorous clips, outtakes and stories that are much talked about on YouTube in theatres considered palaces again. Unfortunately, this goal of providing the best possible night of entertainment is not at the center of moviemakers’ or exhibitors’ thinking. They are not entertainers. Exhibition managers worry only about selling food, arcades and advertisements, while producers worry about having the commitment of a top actress and owning the rights to a franchise. The result is expensive popcorn, a preshow filled with advertisements, and a rehashed movie with likely too much spectacle. And a public watching HBO or Netflix.

Vertical integration and a return to a studio system would also re-align the power structure of movie making. Prior to the Paramount Decrees, all the jobs of movie making were roughly equal. Screenwriters, directors, actors, production crew, and producers were all members of the same studio, and all existed in a hierarchy that ensured everyone was accountable. Some very talented persons were granted autonomy because their talent and responsibility in employing it did not require much oversight. However there wasn’t the systematic bias for one job in filmmaking over all others as exists today with the director. As today, there have always been directors struggling to tell their vision of a story. D.W. Griffith left the MPPC company Biograph because they would not allow him the movie making freedom that he quickly justified with *The Birth of a Nation*. Erich von Stroheim was a great silent era director who constantly battled with Thalberg and other studios because his films were usually far too long, his vision of *Greed* (1924) was six hours for example. However it was in the studio system where all the jobs were controlled into a system that created the best movies, not individual efforts. The average rank (the smaller the better) for a 1940’s movie in the American Film Institute’s top 100 movies of all time is #36, for the 1970’s its #48, and for the 1990’s its #74.[^98] Classical moviemaking was moderated according to the endearing principles of storytelling noted by Aristotle. Alfred Hitchcock is a very noted director, but once he was free of the studio system, and the studio’s production unit he kept for himself, Hitchcock’s once thrilling films of *Foreign Correspondent* (1940), *Notorious* (1946), and *Rear Window* (1952) turned dull. Left alone, the noted director resorted to excessive spectacle with *Psycho* (1960) and *The Birds*(1963), mostly because he lost of the pool of talent the studio system once insured[^99]. George Lucas had complete control over the production over *Star Wars* episodes 1–3 (1999–2005), yet those turned into disasters compared to *Star Wars* 4–6 (1977–1983) because the first trilogy had much greater input from other writers, editors, directors and producers. The Wachowski brothers made brilliance with *The Matrix* (1999), yet when given the freedom to make The Matrix sequels with a budget increase of 238%, the movies didn’t inspire the public at all. The second Matrix had 71% of its gross within 10 days, the third 82%, while it was just 43% for the first movie[^100]. A trend that notes the decline the public had for the spectacle of the sequels. Movies are too complicated, and have too many components that need to mix so well to create a good story, that no person can consistently produce them when relying on their own work. Making magic takes time, expertise, practice, not impulse. As in any great endeavor, movie making is at is greatest when it’s a collaboration. Moreover, if filmmakers are inhibited by a new studio system, unlike the old one, digital filmmaking and the internet allows anyone to pursue their own vision, ensuring visionary talent always has a voice. If it stands out.

Yet the director as visionary is so powerful today, dislodging it is impossible. Many directors think of themselves, and are often thought as, “auteur” of films. Meaning their vision and influence supersedes all other workers to the point they are the author while all others are functionaries. Auteur theory originated to describe how some directors works (such as John Ford, Howard Hawks, and Alfred Hitchcock) in the studio system could be identified film to film thus proving each of their contributions was above the system they worked in. Yet it’s grown to dominate the filmmaking world today, as most directors automatically think of themselves as auteurs who must dominate the filmmaking process. However if movies are in decline today, then so must the way movies are made and produced. It is only with including all members of the movie making process by returning to vertical integration that movies will again become popular in our society. Let the true auteurs reemerge again from a studio system, like their idols of old. The proof of vertical integration’s superiority, in business and art, was proven by Pixar.

There are of course many good, non-franchise movies today. Leonardo DiCaprio, Steven Spielberg, Jason Reitman and others are members to the well-told movies this article aims to promote. But the admission prices are too high, the preshow is boring, and there are simply not enough of them to warrant making a visit to the movie theater a regular event for viewers. Moreover, many, if not most, of the good movies today are computer-animated films, which prove the superiority of a studio system. Pixar, headed by Steve Jobs and John Lasseter, was the first CGI-based movie studio, and Pixar intentionally made movies that were different from Hollywood’s. It is so expensive to process scenes for a computer-animated movie that Jobs and Lasseter spent four years of planning, conferencing, and rewriting *Toy Story* (1995) to ensure the thousands of hours of generating computer images did not go to waste. Pixar is essentially a mini-studio that makes movies as the studios used to, with departments of writers, directors, actors, artists, animators, and producers. These departments are controlled by a chief creative officer in the mode of Irving Thalberg. Just like Thalberg, the immensely capable Lasseter had oversight of the entire enterprise, while at the same time encouraging individual artistic freedom in their jobs. Pixar works a large collaboration, and has a house style, or brand, the same way MGM, and Warner Brothers use to, and the same way HBO does now.

Pixar thus broke the mold of typical Hollywood moviemaking by devoting obsessive attention to superior storytelling. Because of this, Jobs predicted in 1996 that Pixar would have a substantially different hit ratio[^101] than Hollywood was accustomed to. Not surprisingly, all of Pixar’s 13 pictures have been great artistic, cultural, and financial successes for box office numbers). Lasseter compared Pixar to Hollywood by contrasting their respective tolerance to experimentation “(In Hollywood) not only is there no (safety) net, there’s probably spikes down there, so I’m just going to do something I know I can land right. At Pixar not only is there a net, it’s full of down pillows, and big comforters and all that stuff. So failure is part of the process. Try something, figure it out.”[^102] This toleration is exactly what the studio system did, give individual workers freedom to instill art into movies, but give them oversight to ensure everyone tells a good story. Jobs observed that Pixar was fundamentally about “putting stories into the culture, that’s what we’re about”[^103]. Which is exactly what his intellectual and innovative forebear Thalberg set out to do with his studio system.

Lastly, the other factors that aided to the decline of movies are now themselves in decline. Suburbanization, that distanced patrons from movie theatres, has failed spectacularly, for the simple but probably yet unaccepted fact that our society cannot afford to buy everyone a house[^104] which will likely mean higher urbanization and less friction of distance between consumers and movie theatres which have a 15 mile business area limit[^105]. The re-creation of affordable theatres might just help increase urban density because people’s lives won’t be spent inside a home-theatre. The consumerism culture that increased the entertainment options for patrons beginning in the 50’s has likely stopped, or at least slowed because debt levels are so high. As for television, it too is under threat from piracy and digital video recorders[^106], both of which attack television’s advertisement revenue, or entirely replace televisions’ product in a way that does not apply to movies shown at a movie theatre. As for tax law advantaging individual contractors over salaried workers, that has not changed, but if HBO, Netflix, Showtime, Pixar, and others can find ways to work with top tier talent, so can a vertically integrated movie studio aims to do as Thalberg and Jobs did, and produce, distribute and exhibit quality stories again to our culture.

# Conclusion

Movies began as peep shows. As technology progressed, it allowed the exhibition of full feature stories that invoked strong emotions from the American public, putting movies at the pinnacle of American culture. This success aroused the ire of the government of the time, which forced the industry to separate into two groups that have grown to distrust each other while selling the same product. The cultural success of movies attracted corporations that commoditized American culture and like to make and sell repetitive and boring sequels, prequels, and remakes, using spectacle to maintain consumer interest. This overemphasis on spectacle undermines the function of the movie as storyteller. It kills the magic of the movies. Spectacle sells a non-functioning product for a limited time. Eventually products must either function or die. The crux is that to function again today’s legally divided movie industry must die. Like GM, movies depends far too much on short-lived spectacle. Like the music industry, it should adapt to modern technology and depend on the theatre again. Getting rid of the antiquated Paramount Decrees and vertically reintegrating the movie industry will make it function again, by allowing all the elements of storytelling to work together, as they did in the studio system, and do now in the artistically, financially, and cultural successful HBO cable television original programs and at Pixar. If you doubt my words, read those of John Wayne, who told Roger Ebert the following in the early 1970s:

>All the real motion picture people have always made family pictures. But the downbeats and the so-called intelligentsia got in when the government stupidly split up the production companies and the theaters. The old giants — (producers) Mayer, Thalberg, even Harry Cohn, despite the fact that personally I couldn’t stand him — were good for this industry. Now the goddamned stock manipulators have taken over. They don’t know a goddamned thing about making movies. They make something dirty, and it makes money, and they say, ‘Jesus, let’s make one a little dirtier, maybe it’ll make more money.’ And now even the bankers are getting their noses into it[^107].

Switch the variables, and The Duke perfectly describes the auto industry (and many others). Substitute the SUV for the 3D movie sequel, and this 2009 Detroit Auto Show for a soon to come Oscar awards ceremony when some unforeseen event has revealed the weakness in the movie industry, and the money from the public, conglomerates, and government can no longer subsidize the spectacle Hollywood is now addicted to selling. Hollywood is GM’s sequel:

>The symbolism of the freezing temperatures in Detroit this week was lost on no one. The mood at the annual motor show was somber, the razzmatazz noticeable only by its absence. Nobody needed reminding that General Motors (GM), normally the dominant exhibitor and until recently the world’s biggest carmaker, would be in the bankruptcy courts but for emergency federal loans just before Christmas. GM’s plight is only the most dramatic expression of the bleak state of the global car industry. Sales figures published the week before the show confirmed what everyone already knew: the second half of 2008 saw the most savage contraction of demand since the modern industry was formed after the second world war…The woes of Detroit’s Big Three carmakers have received most attention because of the toxic cocktail of factors that has made them especially vulnerable. They relied too much on mammoth pickup trucks and SUVs, which no one wanted when petrol prices hit $4 a gallon. Their finances were already strained after years of restructuring. And they were the most exposed to the American market, which was hit first and hardest by the financial crisis[^108].

# Comments

The below are a few I think of to adapt movies to the digital age. This part is my opinion, so isn’t referenced.

* Get an end to the Paramount Consent Decrees. Let anyone buy and freely operate a movie theatre. Copy Apple Stores. Reintroduce vertical integration into the movies.

* Stop giving yourselves awards like Soviet generals gave out medals.

* Start realizing special effects and 3D aren’t so special anymore.

* Stop it with the movie premiers. Movies are released every week, celebrating everyone is silly. You didn’t walk on Mars or whatever. Let success at the box office/actually entertaining lots of people be your corkscrew to celebratory champagne.

* Stop promoting movies like your selling WWII war bonds. We disregard movie ads and feel sorry for actors having to sit through all those moronic questions. Encourage success with the public, but don’t try to preempt it for every movie.

* Start realizing a good movie is a profitable one at the box office.

* Stop complaining about movie theft. If ever there was a wrong side to be on in turns of technological historical development, its thinking people will behave as if on dial-up forever. Software makers, and game makers have the same problem and don’t whine nearly as much. You had enough warning when CD sales started dying off. Adapt or go away.

* Start giving the audience more original stories and they might start giving you more original money. If you re-hash movies, why can’t the audience also re-hash money they’ve spent before?

* Lower the cost (by a lot) for production and marketing. Use digital technology to make more, various, stories. Actors play superheroes but aren't.

* Stop showing movie credits. Nobody cares who the Production Manager was or know what an Executive Producer even does (if anything), and the intense politicking inducing nature of who gets public credit makes them needlessly harmful.

* Stop the pretense of the MPAA (13, PG-13, R…) rating system.

* Start relying on movie theatres to generate a movie’s profit, not a revenue stream that will be increasingly hard to protect against technology. If you think bit torrent’s and Netflix were a threat, imagine when 3D printing takes away movie merchandising.

* Stop it with this directuer mentality of “A Film by …“. Let your patrons decide which movies are worth singling out using IMDB. There are lots other people involved in making movies, let wannabe authors write novels.

* Stop it with lackluster “how it was made” movie featurettes. They’re mostly a filler for DVD packaging. We know the actors are “really excited about this movie”, we know what green screens are, and that the digital monsters aren’t really there (these features also take away the magic of the movies by the way. Magicians aren’t supposed to tell their tricks.)

* Start realizing a successful actor is one who gets laughs or imputes emotions and experiences and entertains the public.

* Start integrating movies and theatres with other media streams. NBC or Netflix movie theatres or auditoriums for example. Maybe let bars show Game of Thrones. Who knows. But try stuff.

* Stop actors endorsing watches, cars, swing sets, it’s hard to see a character if I see the same face selling me hair dye.

* Stop saying actors “embody” a character, and “transform” themselves, actors pretend, it’s not that difficult or special. Most people do it all day at work. Try working insurance.

* Start changing how much a movie tickets costs per day, show times, and audience demand. Make movies affordable; let people think of the movie theatre as an easy source of social entertainment.

* Hire ushers to monitor theatres, make sure idiots are kicked out.

* Ask patrons to throw out their movie snacks, they usually will, and it’ll save money.

* Start charging fair prices for movie snacks.

* Stop jamming bowling alleys, huge arcade games, consumer ads, into a movie theatre. You don’t see Apple, or the GAP, trying to nickel and dime their patrons with distractions.

* Start hiring professional showmen to run theatres. The public rarely gets to see a professional show, and well-made ones will attract them.

* Stop giving preference to newspaper paid movie reviewers. Let the public decide with social media what our friends should be watching. Why does Peter Travers like everything?

* Start to realize few people go to the theatres. It’s not a social thing to do for most people who aren’t 13, or have other date ideas.

* Stop giving away your story, which should be your product, with marketing. Let your customers be surprised by which actors appear, about a joke, or what happens next.

* Start recognizing that seeing a movie once, maybe twice, is the best standard, not owning a story so it can collect dust on a shelve somewhere.

* Start realizing that the international marketplace will start watching their own movies more.

* Get rid of most, it not all, of the awards shows. Seriously. Padding yourself on your backs, or circle… Is obviously distracting you from your function. Telling stories. Let the public create the civil society of awards, movie reviews, fan clubs on our own.

* Start trusting your product to survive on its own. You have great talent.

* In short give your patron what they like for a fair price. You’ll know want they like by looking at what they are taking their time to build programs for, organize, research, learn, burn, strip, risk viruses, buy bandwidth, computers and hard drives to download. Legally or not. All of that takes some work and money by the way. People only download/stream the story, not the consumer advertisements, the trailers, the credits; not the red-carpet interviews, the countless reviews and the awards ceremonies. People just download the story, because we just want the story. Because the movie industry is bloated with people who can only delivery the fluff and not the story, is not the public’s problem anymore. The people who download and stream, aren’t all lazy thieves. They are rebelling against the non-functioning product the movie industry offers; acting as a check and balance to your hubris, excess and self-indulgence. And because technology is on the public’s side so is history. Our actions are correct and unless the industry adapts, it will continue to decline while complaining and using the very unfair or honorable use of public money (tax credits, endorsements, free news media attention) to stay relevant for a few more years.
