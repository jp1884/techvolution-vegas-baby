# What is a Political Philosophy

No matter who you are, you have a political philosophy. It filters how you see the world. Is Trump evil, a savior, has-been, the future?

We all answer these questions using a political philosophy. If you have an opinion of Trump, you have a political philosophy. So you really should know what it is.

Do you know what the spleen does? What about eye fluid? Most people don't know what most of the human body is or how our own bodies work. We're made up of stuff we don't understand both physically and mentally.

This world of hidden wheels, gears, and pulleys exists for our political opinions as well. We all have an idea of Trump. But like our spleens, we don't really understand why.

We don't understand why because we don't understand the philosophies that guide our thinking. Do you know why the 2nd Amendment is so important to you, or not? Do political people know why they're so involved, why they donate time and money to parties and causes. You can say "because we like it," any more than you can tell the spleen is there because it's there.

Because sometimes you must remove your own spleen; a bad one can kill you. But only if you realized what a thing is and how it's supposed to help you.

Political philosophy is a part of us, just as a spleen is. It defines how we interact with other people and countries.

This blog shows you the hidden purpose of political philosophy. As we unlock it, this blog will also teach you a shiny new philosophy. One built to help you, me, and all humanity prosper again.

Techvolution is its name. Understanding philosophy will empower you to decide if you like it.
