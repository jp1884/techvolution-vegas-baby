# Good Leaders, Bad Leaders

I don't watch the news. And I try to stay away from posts about current events. Put I heard there's rioting in all 50 states. Another black American citizen was murdered by his police force.

I don't know the gentleman's name. I pray he rests in peace.

I don't watch the coverage, and nor do I much care about any social media campaigns with black boxes or whatever. Not because I don't care (I doubt many people spend as much of their free time reading about Abraham Lincoln, Booker T. Washington, or my personal hero Frederick Douglass), but because I've seen this story before. And I know we'll keep seeing it until we change our politics.

I'll explain myself by explaining stories. There are three kinds.

1. Classic
2. Selfish
3. Spectacle

What specifically are these protests asking us to do? Specifically. How are the leaders of these protests showing us the way to a solution to a real problem like every hero should?

Would we watch Star Wars if Luke Skywalker protested the evil Empire? Imagine him and his friends walking outside the Imperial Palace screaming slogans. What about Harry Potter, did he protest Voldemort? Did Juliette scream at her family for getting in the way of her love.

If these protests were a story on Netflix you wouldn't watch it. There's no clear goal, no clear plot. They are lead by selfish people who want to be followed but have no goal to achieve.

When Frederick Douglass lead America out from slavery, he had a clear mission. Educate Northerners and Europeans about the horrors of slavery. With no pictures or video, his words were the ray of light for so many ignorant minds.

Douglass' goal? The elimination of legal slavery.

And he won! He helped grow the Abolitionists movement. And he inspired the Emancipation Proclamation, 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments that banned slavery in enacted equal rights.

When Dr. Martin Luther King lead America out from segregation, he had a clear goal. The elimination of legal segregation and Jim Crow laws.

And he won! When protagonists win, we celebrate their victories in our history books.

There is no law that allows these killings. There's more at-play than simple racism. If it was outright racism, why wouldn't the cops be doing drive bys to avoid getting caught?

What's the problem exactly? I don't know. I'm not the hero of this story.

I do know if these protests were a movie, the opening scene about a outrageous murder would anger you very much. You'd keep watching to find out if this evil would be defeated.

And then twenty minutes later, you'd turn-on something else because there's no clear goal and no clear plot.

The main-character would be sitting there talking about how great they are, and you'd go looking for a proper hero whose knows how to fix the problem.

All I'm telling you is that the same standards you apply to fictional stories, also apply to our real-life stories. The Progressive politics today's activists and social justice warriors use to promote these protests was invented before humanity had running water, or electricity.

Our politics is so old, it can't solve our everyday problems anymore.

Some ideas:

- Do we tax lawyer feeds, do we regulate lawyer fees. If poor, and often black, people are being harrassed, bullied so often, it's probably because they can't fight back. So why not make lawyers fund public defenders?
- Do we the public, create a independent database to record every police interaction. If the police have a problem, why are we trusting _their_ police reports to study that problem?
- Do we hold _ourselves_, to a higher standard. Police time is very often wasted. For example, about 10% of police emergency calls are for car accidents. If we free up police time, we can expect more thoughtful policing.
