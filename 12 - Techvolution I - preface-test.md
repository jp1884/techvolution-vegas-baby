# Back Page

You, me, and everyone else quarantined in their houses are anxiously waiting for the COVID-19 storm to pass.

On the bright side, we have Netflix.

Thanks to our beloved online streaming, pandemic worries are easily replaced with tales of passionate love, wicked magic spells, and galaxies far far away.

Stories are compelling because they're so simple. Protagonists are good because they want to fix a problem. Antagonists are bad because they don't. This moral clarity tells us precisely who the heroes and villains are, and thus lets us commit our emotions.

We can cherish Romeo and Juliet because we understand their love is beautiful and worth dying for! While we also know their families' rivalry is ignorant and stupid. We see Luke Skywalker's rebellion is righteous and worth fighting for! While Darth Vader's empire because it's hellish and must be destroyed.

But our emotions don't change the story. Even the main character's feelings mean so very little to the final outcome.

That's why all characters, from Hogwarts students to Jedi Knights, reach for real objects like wands and lightsabers. And, of course, the enemy readies their tools and weapons too.

And that's why we watch Netflix. Because we enjoy the drama of discovering if the light or dark side better controls the power of magic, the Force, and, most important, technology.

But unlike us, the protagonists can't sit back and enjoy the story.

Because nobody ever won a battle by watching it. The victors are the ones who control the levers of power. Cinderella used a slipper to defeat her treacherous step-family. While Harry Potter used a wand to defeat Lord Voldemort. And Luke Skywalker used a small ship to destroy the Death Star.

When people master the levers of power, they overcome antagonists and solve problems. And, that is the clear lesson Main Street must learn today.

Otherwise, this pandemic was for nothing.

Talk to any political junkie, no matter when, and they'll say there's a big election coming up. They'll tell you, "if the Right-wing triumphs, infrastructure, healthcare, everything will go to shit!"

If you buy it—and most of us have at some point—you glue yourself to Left-wing blogs, radio, and TV. Filled with Left-wing philosophy, you start seeing sinister Conservatives all over the place. Or, if the other side sucked you in first, you start spotting sinful Progressives instead.

But it's all bullshit.

Despite Left/Right yelling matches, neither ideology is your enemy. Because neither is your hero. Both only care to send you one-way messages to tune-in, protest, or donate. Like a bad friend, Left/Right partisans only want your attention and money. Idealogues think you're an extra in your own political life.

Galileo, George Washington, and Luke Skywalker reached for the power of new technology. So, why shouldn't you? Even more important, why shouldn't the middle-class? Isn't our healthcare, infrastructure, and especially our pandemic preparation, worthy of upgrades?

Of course they are. And, that's the point.

The feud between Left and Right is a distraction. The politics of upgrading our lives (or not) is the real political game of our time.

This contest started in 1970 when our civilization left the Industrial Age and entered the Internet Age.

The owners of industrial age technology don't want you holding advanced tools. Netflix is too affordable. And even more threatening, it lets you decide what to watch and when. That's why "Darth Blockbuster" is working hard to antagonize all future upgrades. He wants to keep society's levers of power all to himself.

Happily, many internet geeks, hackers, and innovators have been fighting Darth Blockbuster's antagonism. But, they can't keep fighting your battles for you. Main Street must now jump-in and help the protagonists.

There is no debate. The story is simple. We must upgrade our society now.

If we don't, this pandemic only foreshadows a much more terrible storm to come. Every year, month, and day we stall, only makes our technology, tools, and culture more outdated. It'll only get harder to respond and prevent things like recessions, depressions, and pandemics.

This book will teach you how to upgrade our society to the Internet Age. Like conquering illiteracy, defeating slavery, and going to the Moon, upgrading our culture will be a glorious story to tell your grandkids.

Once you realize politics is a game worth playing.

# Preface

"_People are angry, man! Most people's lives suck...Even if like the economy is doing better, the vast majority of people aren't doing what they want to do with their lives._" Joe Rogan, November 2019.

This book was going to deal with your levels of anger and happiness in life. It was going to begin with analyzing your take on the economy, nation, and life at large.

Now we've hit the Great 2020 Pandemic. I don't need to inquire about your happiness anymore. If you're like most Americans and Canadians, you're likely downright terrified about getting sick, and perhaps worse, what the future holds.

For years, North Americans suffered under troubling trends: micro-management at work, antisocial behavior at home, and political hatred in government. We got by because superficially we're "doing great": we have full employment, luxurious homes, and stable politics. Whenever things got too bad, and we got too unhappy, we visited the shopping mall for therapy. If we were still angry, we'd install a new political party. Over the years, we've given Left and Right the levers of power again and again.

No matter which we choose, Main Street wasn't happy with the results.

That's because there is something fundamentally wrong with our society. Now its time we step up, as our ancestors did so many times before, and rethink our way of life. The hardest part isn't about explaining our problems or coming up with solutions. It involves the realization that ordinary people should be happy with our jobs, government, and life.

It's our right to enjoy happy lives.

Because individual happiness is the ultimate sign of a healthy society. Interesting to note, our ancestors were often happier then we are. Even though they were hard up in comparison. Our grandparents or great-grandparents weren't "simpler." Nor did they have lower standards. They were content because they saw their society improve every year.

In contrast, our society is going backward. The trends that make us unhappy like horrible commutes, expensive education, and mindless bureaucracies keep getting worse. A significant reason is that as employees and customers of big bureaucracies and corporations, we're powerless to demand better.

But the bigger reason for our society's decline is our belief in Left and Right political ideologies.

We keep alternating which "side" controls our governments. But nothing changes with either because the truth is we give Conservative and Progressive doctrines far too much credit. Regular people on Main Street following one (or hating another) are never going to solve our problems.

When I began writing this book in September 2019, I wanted to (somehow) convince the middle-class to stop putting so much faith in Left and Right writers, commentators, and thinkers. Not only do partisan leaders avoid living on Main Street. Both ideologies were invented centuries ago; before humanity even had electricity. Their ideas and platforms are simply too old and outdated to give us happiness in modern civilization.

It's okay to change our ideologies. Most people don't realize that. But we're free to pick and choose whichever one we want. There's nothing special about any political doctrine. Each was created by a human being to help society prosper.

So, if you're not happy with your life, you're _supposed_ to change the philosophy that rules your nation.

And now you should.

Because this one virus is highlighting just how shaky our foundations really are.

There have been hundreds of pandemics throughout history—and yet today, we were caught with our pants down. Why? Why was President Trump impeached? What was the reason? Even if you agreed with it then, was that media circus really what our government and political energy should have been completely obsessed with only a few months ago?

Both partisan "side" are the faces of the exact same coin. When President Obama tried to overhaul the health-care system, was any commentator, strategist, or politician talking about pandemic plans? We have fire drills throughout our society; why don't we have pandemic plans?

_<City fires plagued humanity for thousands of years. Until we used technology to overcome and prevent them. The invention dates are approximations because fire codes and equipment rolled out differently during the 1900s. Credit: Wikimedia Commons, Library of Congress, and Unsplash.>_

Here's why. Instead of governing our society, Left/Right ideologues, commentators, and columnists have been blaming each other for their inability to get things done.

I mean, if you ignored an election, would you even notice who won? If you looked at a COVID-19 infection map, could you uncover which states, provinces, and countries are governed by Left or Right parties?

You couldn't, because Left/Right have no original ideas. They keep tinkering with government policy because neither understands how modern technology works. But no law encourages traffic, climate change, or forces our workdays to get more fraustrating. Remember, Harry Potter didn't write down new spells and assume Voldemort would go away. Protagonists solve problems with real-life objects.

This isn't just a pandemic. It's a test to see how well we can deal with life's inevitable challenges. Depressions, wars, famines, and epidemics are inevitable and not defeated by TV arguments or words in a regulation handbook.

We're struggling today, because our political ideologies are so old they're stagnating our government, culture, and civilization. I happened to be writing this book long before the coronavirus. Suddenly history has given us all a sad reality check.

To upgrade our civilization and re-attain stability, health, and happiness, we need to revamp a lot of things. Techvolution, a new philosophy that empowers the people of Main Street, will help us get there.

## Our Levers of Power

Do me a favor. Open up Skype or FaceTime. Now check your Instagram feed. Then get Google Maps up and running.

I'm serious, open these apps up. Come back when you're done.

Isn't it cool that within a few seconds, you can chat with friends, see what's trending, and receive pin-point directions? Even as society is under quarantine, you have these formidable levers of power at your disposal. I mean, can you even imagine writing driving directions on a napkin. What about driving back and forth to Blockbuster (twice) every time your family watches a single movie?

Can you imaigne the waiting lines at video rental stores? Good things this is't 1990!

Okay, so now get your medical records ready. Next up, get your health metrics like heart rate, temperature, and sleep cycles. Excellent, now let's evaluate your risk factor to COVID-19 by comparing your statistics to the records of those unlucky people who got sick, especially the ones who are seriously ill.

What characteristics like blood types, fitness, and genetics is this new disease targetting?

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/DemandingImpureBobwhite' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

_Please enable sound. Credit: [JRE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PwTgpTlJBg)_

I pray your risk factor is small. But, if you're in trouble, what does your nurse or doctor say to do? Don't tell me, but I hope it was at least calming to hear specialized medical advice.

Hey, don't forget, there's a possible drug shortage. So, what is your pharmacist recommending? Do you have enough prescriptions? What should you start doing now to plan for the worse?

After you've collaborated with these health professionals, quickly find out what your health insurance company will pay for. Just in case, it's good to know before disaster strikes.

Phew, that was educational. Isn't it good to know all this stuff! Apps and gadgets are cool, but I personally think knowledge is the ultimate lever of power.

## Problems

Wait, wait, wait. FaceTime worked, so did Instagram and Google Maps. But is the medical records "lever" stuck? What will the ER doctor assess you by in case of a flood of patients?

Did I hear that right, you aren't in contact with your doctor? What about your pharmacist? You're waiting on hold with your insurance company! Insurance is basically a bank-account for disasters, and now during a pandemic, you have no idea how much money you have?

This all sounds like I'm talking to someone living through the 1918 Spanish Flu Pandemic. It's like science-fiction in reverse. Because, if someone in 1918 was teleported to 2020, they'd fit in just fine.

Well, at least many of our students, teachers, and workers can learn, work, and collaborate from home in these tough times.

WHAT! You're still driving to work! Or worse, your work or school is closed!

What the fuck is wrong with your laptop and the internet at home? Wasn't there a plan to keep things moving in case of earthquakes (San Francisco 1989), riots (Vancouver 2011), hurricanes (New Orleans 2005), city fires (Fort McMurray 2016), floods (New Jersey 2012), pandemics (H1N1 2009) and blizzards and seasonal flu (every winter in North America)?

Responding to this pandemic should have been a slight modification of dealing with a rainstorm or blizzard. But it wasn't. I wonder what we were all doing before March 2020.

## People in High Places

Left and Right can't help upgrade our society. But they don't operate our businesses, bureaucracies, and daily lives.

Upon reflection, it's no surprise we didn't have a plan for this COVID-19 outbreak. Because we don't have procedures for any disaster. Because our way of life is controlled by a select group of people looking to protect their high-paying positions.

I was an insurance claims adjuster for seven years, the person with the checkbook you talk to after horrible events like car accidents and house fires. Despite promoting a low-risk lifestyle, the insurance industry still didn't prepare for disasters themselves. One example, we adjusters were forced to drive into an office during heat-waves, blizzards, and ice-storms.

It's quite surreal to speak with people who had a tragic car crash on the exact same roads your boss is demanding you drive. You can have a debate about telecommuting versus offices. But not when the streets have three feet of snow.

This speaks to our society's fundamental problem. Regular people aren't ready for bad times because we aren't free to decide what's best for ourselves in good times.

It's our own fault.

We gave the levers of power in our schools, hospitals, companies, and bureaucracies, to the same people that were giving us unhappy lives as customers and workers. That's why our society is shutting down during this coronavirus pandemic.

Should we really have expected better?

## Unhappy is a Sign of an Unhealthy Society

Our workplaces are riddled with too many bureaucrats, managers and, consultants. This way of life made us very unhappy. I wrote a book to try to convince you, it also made us dangerously complacent too. And now, sadly, it's obvious for everyone to see and feel every time we hear "the virus is getting closer."

Our society is fragile against disasters because of our "eight different bosses" culture. They've controlled our manufacturing, hospitals, insurance companies, and many other industries for generations.

As a result, when using our education system, making a claim, signing a mortgage, it's like we're still renting DVDs from Blockbuster. As in, we're stuck with the hours of operation, DVD selection, and corporate policies of the rich and powerful with no ability to have our say.

Having our say makes all the difference in the world. It's the difference between being lost at sea with a radio hearing the search parties. And holding a two-way radio so you can tell the rescuers where you are.

But, the eight different bosses will never give you that power.

Why would they? To keep their positions and prestige, they're following the old maxim, the one with the money has the control, and the one who needs it stays under control.

And crucially, holding onto this power isn't actually their fault. We'll see later in this book, the massive management of today's world is a holdover from the Industrial Age.

We're all simply waiting to evolve a new work culture.

This is why regular people have super-advanced apps like Skype, Instagram, and Google Maps in their private lives. But, we're watching CNN, checking mailboxes for unemployment checks, and wondering how we'll earn a living while an killer disease searches the globe for human hosts.

Being so powerless is needless bullshit, to say the least.

When nagging about TPS reports made us unhappy, we bought bigger TVs, cars, and houses. When the middle-class got too angry, we'd turn to Left and Right politics. We thought to march in a Tea Party parade, or watching a Bernie Sanders political speech, was doing our part to solve our society's problems.

It wasn't. And now we're paying for it.

Because we're depending on our weakened manufacturing base, dated insurance processes, and overburdened health-care system to stop this pandemic.

## Our Old Health Care System

Doctors study really hard to learn the knowledge that keeps us healthy. That's why they're rightfully respected in every society on Earth.

Despite that esteem, [in this TED talk from 2015](https://youtu.be/mafghkNmKgo) Dr. Alieta Eck discusses how much of a let-down her job is. You see, when she started medical school in the early '80s, she thought practicing medicine meant making deep connections with patients. She pictured detailed examinations, home visits, and being there when needed most.

Instead, Dr. Eck got something far different. To her sadness, the Main Street economy, where customers directly dealt with specialists like carpenters, tailors, and doctors, was long gone.

True to the trend ravaging our economy, what Dr. Eck got was ever-more bureaucrats running interference drills. Since 1970, the valuable administration of clinics and hospitals was taken over by government and corporate middlemen. These people created ever-more paperwork to put themselves in between doctors and their patients.

Notice I said paperwork, because actual paper forms, regulations, and fax machines help delay processing and justify more bureaucratic positions. That's why our society doesn't have "Medical FaceTime" or "InstaInsuranceHealth" apps connecting patients directly with their therapists, nurses, pharmacists, nutritionists, and doctors.

Using digital technology to its full potential would put many micro-managing middlemen out of a job.

![Health-Care Bureaucrats](https://techvolution.io/content/images/2020/04/healthcare-bureaucrats.png)

_"Hello, Peter," memos, and eight different bosses multiplied by 3500%, and trending up no matter which political party we elected into power. Credit: [PNHP](http://www.pnhp.org/publications/NEJM5_2_91.htm)._

Is it a surprise the Internet Age started in 1970?

As computers got better it made typing and printing increasingly easy. A small group of administrators turned into almost countless regulators, managers, executives, and lawyers who used computers to make more memos, rules, and regulations.

Using new technology for themselves, and keeping it away from customers, is how the middlemen kept growing.

Some middlemen are in fact needed. Many however, are not. All of them have been sucking our health-care system dry for generations while holding back new technologies from reaching the hands of the middle-class.

Main Street doesn't notice how screwed we're getting.

## Nobody Is There

"Why don't they have enough medical supplies?"

"Why didn't they have pandemic plans?"

Too many of us on Main Street though calling ourselves consumers and taxpayers meant it was okay to assume "they" inside Big Business or Big Government is looking out for our best interest.

Have you ever demanded to hospitals stock months of medical supplies? Have you ever seen a politicians pandemic plan?

Why would "they" do these things, if you're not?

Our problem is we've been obsessed with Left/Right politics and thought "fighting for our health-care" meant picking aside for (or against) policies like Obama-care.

In the end, the Left's ideology of Big Government and the right's ideology of Big Business came together to make a philosophy of Big Problems for Main Street. A 3500% increase in government and corporate middlemen means cleaners, paramedics, nurses, and doctors have been understaffed, underfunded, and underpowered for generations.

> A lab inspector from the state came and wanted to know who was running this (lab) machine. And she wanted to be sure they all have high-school diplomas. Well, we had RN degrees, MD degrees. That didn't suffice. She wanted to see high-school diplomas. That's an example of mindless bureaucracy. [Dr. Alieta Eck.](https://youtu.be/mafghkNmKgo?t=54)

Talk to anyone on the frontline of today's pandemic and ask them if they feel ready. Face masks are already running low. So are disinfectant cleaners. Hand sanitizers are often empty. More ventilators are needed, but no one knows where to get them. Even with so many bureaucrats and historical examples, no one was planning for a disaster.

Likewise, whenever there is a bad storm, our car and property insurance claim departments scramble to keep up.

Long-time and loyal customers can wait hours to speak with somebody and months to get their checks. During my time, I'd often have to explain to customers why the insurance company takes their money digitally but insists on paying claims with paper checks sent via snail mail.

I felt sorry for them. These customers paid their bills, and their claim was approved. Yet, they were like a ship-wrecked man on a beach, desperately waving at passing ships because he has no real levers of power to wield.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/SickWetIndusriverdolphin' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

_This is exactly how people respond after being on hold for 45 minutes. I'm sadly only exaggerating a bit. Credit: [Cast Away](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cast_Away)._

There is no good reason my customers had to wait. But like I said above, the powerful managers and executives won't give regular people a fair deal if they don't have to.

It's sad if you think about it.

Because the people who pay the bills and taxes are like extras watching their society, instead of being active players in it.

Think of this pandemic. A person during the Spanish Flu Pandemic of 1918 got their news on radios and newspapers. What would they say about us doing the same while holding supercomputers, HD cameras, and biometric sensors in our hands?

If you believe in Leftist politics, explain how more regulations or single-payer health insurance will help us prepare for the next pandemic. Coverage is crucial, but have a vote on the issue and move on. There are many other ways to improve our health-care system, such as comparative analysis of treatments, bio-testing sewers to track disease, or making every insurance more natural to use.

If you're a Rightist, ask how many corporate boardrooms want their employees to be financially independent and capable of taking months off work when needed? Practically none is the answer. Then how is more corporate employment the best way to make regular people more secure?

The truth is, at this moment, people need solar panels, stores of food in their cellars, and a robust local supply system. Even better would be online education, seamless communication with medical professionals, easy tests for the virus, insurance apps that customers control, and the ability to still make a living during a disaster.

Regular people can have all of this with modern technology. That's the hidden truth of today's society. For example, watch [The Pharmicist](https://www.netflix.com/ca/title/81002576) on Netflix, and you'll see how a simple online database of prescriptions stopped oxycontin pill mills.

Big Business or Big Government only made nearly a decade after it was needed.

But with open-source software (the free technology that makes programs like Instagram possible), the public could have banded together and built a secure and straightforward prescription database that would have prevented the turmoil, sorrorow and needless waste of [500,000 doctors prescribed opioid overdoses.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_epidemic_in_the_United_States)

With today's electronics and software, we don't need to depend on Big Government or Big Business. Main Street doesn't have to give the levers of power to middlemen.

In a nutshell, if someone from 1918 were to see us today, they'd marvel at FaceTime and Youtube, but then say we have the tools of science fiction, just not the way of life.

Techvolution will give it to you, me, and everyone else on Main Street.

## Segway

A crisis should teach us to evolve. But, the many in recent memory, from the [loss of American manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_in_the_United_States), [Savings and Loan Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_and_loan_crisis), [Dot Com Crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble), [rising cost of formal education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_tuition_in_the_United_States), and the [Great Recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession) our society borrowed more money instead. We subsidized and bailed out the "too big to fail" manufacturers, insurance companies, colleges, and banks, who caused the problems.

The truth is, these big institutions are holdovers from the Industrial Age. But, rather than admit we needed to fundamentally rework our society, we used money to sweep the bailouts, and bullshitization of work, under the rug.

Now we can't sweep anything, anywhere. This pandemic is something different.

Printing more money can't kill a virus. Regular people literally can't go shopping or watch professional sports to distract themselves from the bad news. After so many crises were ignored, this one is actually shutting our society down.

The public scare, economic fall, and makeshift plans caused by this pandemic is not a surprise. Our society has been getting more in debt, wasteful, surrounded by red-tape, dependent on foreign manufacturing, and micro-managed for years.

The coronavirus is only exposing problems we've ignored for years.

There is no reason to despair. Internet Age technology is wondrous. There is a golden meadow waiting for us once we decide to upgrade our culture.

To get to this new world, Main Street needs a new philosophy.

Here it is. Its big lesson is this. The middle-class must solve our problems with digital technology now. If we don't, we'll soon be suffering something much worse than unhappiness and scary pandemics. There's only so much longer we can keep running our civilization on the fumes of Left and Right ideology before our debts explode, or bureaucracies implode, and our bullshit jobs aren't worth working anymore.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/GoodDimpledBarbet' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

_We have so many bullshit jobs because we still use Industrial Age culture. To make the most of modern technology, we need a new philosophy. If we don't evolve soon, we'll end up erased from history like the Soviets._ [Wisecrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Lngf3J8vN4).

## Note to the reader

As you've already seen, I used many images and videos throughout the book. I did so because visuals help explain ideas better. Also, since total strangers made the videos (I only edited them down), they exemplify how powerul the internet is. Today, millions of regular people are communicating their opinions and expertise directly. Not since the printing-press has information empowered ordinary people so much. These content creators and their audiences are doing historic work. Of course, all credit for the media goes to them.

Also, I use pop culture references such as those of Star Wars, Star Trek, Harry Potter, The Office, and computer games (e.g., Civilization). If you're not a fan, don't worry too much. If we were in Ancient Greece, I'd use Greek Mythology. If we were in Victorian Britain, I'd use Shakespeare. Using familiar stories is a more natural way to explain philosophy, politics, and in general, to relate to one another. Of course, all due credit goes to the media's owners.

I am still getting reader feedback, so if you like to contribute anything [let me know](https://www.techvolution.io/contact/).
