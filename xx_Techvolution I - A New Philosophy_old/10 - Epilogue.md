## My App

My app. Using modern web development, it took but a few weeks of coding. Take some free code from GitHub, a cloud computing platform access, and the app design of a novice. It would barely pass a introductory coding course. Probably wouldn't even get me a job in "tech".

The tool wasn't polished because new tools never are. It was, would have been, so effective because it came directly from the frontline. A place far away from the ruling philosophy.

Here's how it worked, after a car accident, two drivers don't know what to do, so they don't often exchange "contact details" like names or insurance policy numbers. My adjusting job was talking to these drivers to process their insurance claims. The one supposed to return drivers back to normal. Or at least as best to normal as money can get them. A big problem was simply knowing who the other driver and adjuster were. Names, policy numbers, phone numbers, were all gold.

The job sucks. Drivers are "hallowed customers" who want normal now! The only tools we adjusters had was telephone, email, voicemail, checkbook, google, and a supervisor telling us to hurry up or get fired. Beyond st-st-stress ~~stressful~~, very emotionally taxing.

Until you speak with a driver who is a real person.

Real people, whose car accident wasn't an inconvience, but a life changing horror. Maybe they lost an arm, or their friend is in the Intensive Care Unit, or maybe their kid burned alive twelve hours ago.

You're mind disregards the threats of homelessness from your idiot supervisor the moment you talk to this real person. They have a problem and your soul wants to help.

Why did this happen? That's all they want to know. Was someone trying to beat a red light? Was the road not salted for ice. Was it drunk driving? What's the reason for the pain.

The frontline, where things of consequence happen, experienced a problem, and this person on the phone is now defined by it. And they feel relief when knowing the reason. They love the chance to fight the pain by making sure this problem wont happen again.

My app was a new tool that combined several technologies. Email. Internet. GPS systems. Google Maps. Web apps.

It let insurance adjusters post an accident on a google map, and verified their identity by their work email. Since every accident shares the GPS coordinates, all adjusters, regardless what drivers do, can find each other. It's minimal operating cost was paid for by rental car companies and repair shops, who loved the ability to send invoices directly to adjusters without have to call first.

A new tool for adjusters that only someone on the frontline would ever feel the pain to make.

Society would save hundreds of millions in insurance claim processing. That's cool. Adjusters's would save hours a day. That's cool too. But this is the part worthy of fighting over. With my app, for the first time, we'd have a database of the exact location and causes of car accidents. Thereafter we could cross reference this database with weather, traffic, and other patterns. We'd finally learn why car accidents happens, and start to fight back.

This database doesn't exist today. Branches overtop stop signs. Cars with faulty brakes. Intersections that need longer red lights to be cleared. Buildings that reflect a sunrise too brightly. And whatever else machine learning, and artifical intelligence can tell us when we give it data about the millions of accidents, and tens of thousands of deaths, that happen every year.

Seeing the blank faces, the clueless looks, the complete arrogance, of the executives, lawyers, marketers, and consultants who stood in the way of the frontline workers, and entire society, waiting for this solution, merged years of political theory in my mind and let me see a new ruling philosophy called Techvolution clearly in my head.

It was still hard as anything writing this book. It was condensing so much history and political theory in my head. I was mentally very tired and a little bitter to be honest. Then I watched an episode of Netflix's _Black Mirror_ and went back to work.

This episode was the tale of a crazed man, out to talk with the CEO of an app called Smithereens. He holds a company intern hostage awaiting his call. Police surround him, corporate lackies try to deflect him, but he waits his phone call. Nobody knows why.

I soon started to cry, eyes tearing puddles as I full out wept. I knew this crazed man.

I knew a few minutes into the show that distracted driving killed someone close to him. The crazed man had been driving, and he checked his Smithereen feed, and he missed a drunk running a stop sign. I didn't guess it was his own distracted driving, but I knew the pain the actor played out so well. I used my soul to ease this person's pain for years.

I made a new tool that would have helped. Not solved. Not actual magic, but it majically would have gotten us closer. Darth Blockbuster stopped it. He'll never say that, or even know it. To him the frontline is a place to stand above, not live within.

I did my best as a protagonist. I still wonder how many lives were lost because I failed going all the way, but I did my best. The point isn't self-pity. The point is self-pity doesn't need to exist in the digital age. For the philosophy of digital tools isn't a place of heroic individuals with a mass of extras behing them. Everyone is a hero in the ruling philosophy of techvolution.

Rest assured, the millions of the protagonists inside the open-source community will soon make a app far better and more powerful than my little thing. And Darth Blockbuster will never stop it. The question is, now that the Sith are dead, how do we empower you in the open-source community of Jedi, to build the future. Living on Mars and travelling the stars needs a new way of life. All us geeks have seen it, and wish to work under it, inside the command of Captain Picard.

That's coming up in the sequel, _Techvolution: Building Starfleet_.

### Personal Note on Political Philosophy, The Prince, and the Executive

This was the the executive. It will do for economics what the prince did for science and later on for politics. putting humans below the story, and letting the truth of the world as seen and sensed by tools, to determine our truths. human affairs, especially economic ones of what we make and use, needs the same transition as science, and democracy has today.

If it was called and presented that, you'd likely seen it through red and blue eyes. I hoped to showcase how the prince changed and belittled human thinking but that meant to empower it with science that has done more to improve humanity's progress than anything else in history.

I wish this book means humanity will never need another lesson. That's probably too idealistic. So hopefully this books will make it easier the next time human hubris gets in the way of heavenly progress.
