## We Dream To Fight in The Grandstory

communities needed, think membranes. _One Strange Rock_

Why do we dreamers do it. Think of the foolishness. Luke Skywalker was a farmer, fighting an evil galactic empire. Romeo and Juliette died for love, at 15. There are lot of Cinderella's who dream of their prince, years into their marriage.

Real-life personal dreamers are no more rational. Rousseau was chased around Europe. Socrates had to drink poison. Jefferson declared independence from the world's superpower. Douglass faced down horror every day. One thing's for sure, whatever their reason, dreamers aren't selfish.

Wait... dreams, the brief visions of a better world, can't be selfish. Because they're not choices. Dreams are afflictions. They choose to show wondrous perfection to some people, who become bound to make the vision real. All stories, whether about defeating a galactic empire, or finding love, are fueled by dreams. Because the only thing harder to live with than a failed dream, is never trying to make it real.

That's why we celebrate heroic dreamers. Their lives are messages across time. Because while items, passions, dialogue, antagonists, and thoughts change, the plot of life is always the same. Be the protagonist. Keep fighting evil. You'll know what to fight for, because you'll dream about it.

Dreams connects our microstories to the grandstory. They make us realize our lives make a difference, if we dream. When enough dreamers live to make new technology and network them together, life prospers. When we master our microstories inside this grandstory, we'll achieve my dream of techvolution.

## The Grandstory is Life vs. Entropy

Do you think fish, dogs, or dolpins dream? I don't know either, and we'll probably never find out. But they must do something similar. After all lifeforms fight for their life, and at the very least dream of making life better with their very existence. We humans are just lucky (or unlucky) enough to see our dreams and consciously fight for them. Either way, all lifeforms want to contribute to the grandstory.

The grandstory is pretty simple. Keep life alive and evolving. The devils is in the details. Because the setting to the grandstory is a dangerous, lifeless, and remorseless place called the Universe. And like a sand castle on the beach, every non-living thing in the Universe, from stars, meteors, or mountains, eventually falls a part; stars run of fuel, meteors hit something, mountains erode away, and sand castles return to just being sand. Science calls this entropy. It's the law by which every non-living organization eventually disorganizes into nothing.

To survive life must organize itself faster than entropy can tear it a part. Think about it, if the Universe was heaven, and stayed the same, then life could just exist, and not need to evolve. Life battles entropy inside this grandstory with two strategies. The first is simple survival instincts, used when entropy attacks with disasters like hurricanes, tidal waves, or volcanos. The second strategy is planning ahead by evolving between entropy attacks. These good times is when lifeforms can evolve more tools like eyes, sonar, fur, feathers, warm blood, and hands. The desire to live, and then to evolve more tools, is how life went from a single-cell organism on a nearly desolate Earth, and turned it into a Eden full of life.

Life is thus a beatiful story about overcoming entropy. The plot of the story is survival and evolution, the setting is the Universe, entropy's henchmen of disasters are the antagonists, and life's protagonists are a bunch of different lifeforms trying to survive and evolve enough tools to defeat entropy's next attack.

Inside this grandstory all lifeforms, from Luke Skywalker, to Darth Vader, dream of being protagonists. However, there is a trend to life's grandstory that actually makes some lifeforms antagonists, because even life uses entropy to its advantage during its evolution.

## Evolution Is How Life Fights Entropy

Evolution was discovered in 1858 by Charles Darwin. But it's been with life since it started the grandstory over 4.2 billion years ago. Evolution is how life writes new characters to battle entropy.

Since life starts as simple cells, evolution had a lot of writing to do to get to us humans. Evolving new characters via adaptations has three steps:

1. give individual lifeforms slightly different traits (ex. bigger eyes or thicker feathers)
2. different traits give different rates of survival and reproduction for each lifeform.
3. traits are passed from generation to generation.

These evolutionary steps are called natural selection. They're how life writes new characters to battle entropy. By giving each lifeform slightly different variations, life experiments which is best. The most able to problem-solve live on and thus and pass on their traits to following generations. The failures die. However the failures, along with the the rest of life's infinite varations, are always waiting for the casting agent to call back if entropy introduces a problem that requires their unique mix of traits.

Life thus uses death to its advantage. Life can't be stubborn, or have favorite lifeforms. Life must listen to death, to find out which lifeforms to procreateto and evolve from. So while a chubby cheetah doesn't die because of entropy, his death is a disoganization of a lifeform, and thus is entropy. Life thus uses entropy as a test bed to find out which variation to keep alive. If evolution is life's writer, death, whether by an ice age or because of a unhelpful trait, is life's audience.

Although evolution may seem like a cruel, all lifeforms dream to join the story. We dream of being the microstory that helps life prosper. This is perhaps ruthless, but natural selection's "survival of the fittest" has stayed ahead of entropy for billions of years.

So here we have two teams battling for control of the Universe. Humans have called their dreams to win the grandstory many different names. Good vs. Evil, God vs. Satan, Gondor vs. Mordor, Hogwarts vs. Death Eaters, Jedi vs. Sith, Blockbuster vs. Netflix. These are all stories about the ultimate battle in the Universe, Life vs. Entropy. Evolution is the Life Star to entropy's Death Star. And evolution has a roadway.

## Some Characters Are Better Than Others

Life writes characters according to entropy. Yet, life still works towards more complex characters during its evolution. Complexity makes lifeforms more self-sufficient, and thus more able to survive the many different entropy attacks. When life got to us very self-sufficient, reasonable humans, we can study entropy, and win battles like city fires, or earthquakes, before they set life back.

But humanity could never exist by itself. We're the result of billions of years of evolution. It took life's evolution inside various categories of plants, bacteria, animals and fungus, that each divide in millions of divisions, classes, orders, families, genus, and species. The point is, evolution kept bringing more lifeforms down into existence, and built enough lifeforms to support us humans.

As life evolved from simple-cells, to antropods, fish, lizards, mammals, and finally us humans, life wrote ever more tools into its lifeforms. Thereby making us more resilient to entropy. The first adaption is the simplest, the last the most complex:

- *_Nutrition:_ leafs, digestion, blood, stomachs etc.
- *_Procreation:_ seeds, pollen, nuts, reproductive organs etc.
- *_Locomotion:_ branches, stems, hooves, hands, etc.
- *_Sensation:_ touch, eyes, ears, noses,  etc.
- *_Intellectual:_ memory, problem solving, learning from experience.
- *_Reason:_ understanding abstract rules.

They key is life is always adding more tools. Think of a blade of grass. It a rock fall in front of its sunshine, it can't move to save it's life. Thus when trees grew branches, it became more self sufficient, and could travel a bit. Now think how much faster ants can move, and thus can flee danger better. Yet ants can sense their world as well as a bat, which can move and sense where it should go. Then there's an animals ability to remember and learn from experience. Like where danger lies, or the best food is. Then lastly, there's reason, the ability to understand abstract rules, like evolution, and therefore manipulate the world, and not be bound to suffer death to learn.

Life starts from near zero. And given enough time from entropy, will keep writing characters with more tools. As lifeforms get more powerful, they're more self-sufficient, and thus individuals can survive entropy attacks more, and don't need to die as much to evolve. However, all life fights entropy best when all its lifeforms collaborate inside ecosystems.

ecosystems modes and orders, is the ruling philosophy.
[need Aristotel triangle]

## Evolution Happens Inside Ecosystems

In the grandstory, lifeforms use survival instincts to live through entropy attack. During peaceful times, life evolves more tools. Life uses each other get better tools. Iron sharpens iron so to speak. And since no lifeform can have it all, networking all these tools together inside a ecosystem supercharges life against entropy.

All ecosystems start as barren landscapes, with just the basic neccessities at hand like sunlight and water. The sooner life fills the area with lifeforms, the sooner its stabilized. The first step is thus a land rush. Competition is the means of success. Whichever lifeform is the first to lifeform to repeatedly seed, grow, and procreate, wins.

When life's making a new ecosystem, the winners are mostly grasses, weeds, and ferns. These plants are resilient, self-reliant, grow fast, spread fast, and reproduce faster. Their success in the land rush gives them property rights over it. Literally, they control the physical property where they're growing. And their families keep control of their property via inheritance.

And here's the best part, while all these plants keep fighting for survival, they all still end up dead. And here's how life uses entropy again. Because after lifeforms die, their decaying biomass keeps the nutrients to harbour more life. The more biomass, the greater an area's carrying capacity. The more carrying capacity an area has, the more lifeforms it can carry. The winners of the land rush deaths, fertilizers an environment for way more lifeforms.

Rich soil and high carrying capacity enables ecosystems. With ecosystems life stops the land rush. Now life obsesses over every resource. Every drop of water, ray of sunshine, and gust of wind becomes valuable. Life's problem is figuring out how to harness them. Evolution starts writing into like a crazed writer, trying to find a character to harness every resource. Flowers need bees, bees need trees for their hives, trees need heigh to find sunlight, the web of characters is keeps going.

The more time life has to evolve, the more characters it calls up. Each character is increasingly different because each uses resources a little bit differently. Whether its tall trees, beautiful flowers, hidden mushrooms, fish in the streams, birds in the air, whales in the sea, or monkey's in the trees. These diverse lifeforms aren't like the simple grasses, weeds, and ferns. They don't compete for property rights. These lifeforms collaborate to defeat entropy inside their shared ecosystem.

Ecosystems are a community of lifeforms inside a shared environment, like a mountain range, grassland, or coral sea. All lifeforms inside the ecosystem collaborate to use every possible resource to sustain and make more lifeforms. Life wants to keep writing new characters, living millions of different microstories.

By networking life, lifeforms collaborate inside an ecosystem, each is working together to fight entropy. Every resource is maximized, and Earth becomes Eden. with more lifeforms, life is better prepared for entropy's next attack. If it's an ice age, meteor hit, or sun flares, life has a better starting point to evolve from. Ecosystems distribute life, not putting all eggs into a few lifeforms basket. Ecosystems must keep so many lifeforms honest to keep the system working.

## Ecosystems Work Because of Accountability and Reciprocation

Ecosystems help life write ever more lifeforms. These characters grow stronger, preparing life against entropy's next attack. This blend of individual survival, with community networking, means all lifeforms benefit from their own improvements. When we dream, we dream of making a difference inside a ecosystem.

So ecosystems need a way to track contributions. They do this with food chains. Food chains are like a financial system for nature that enfore good behavior. Lifeforms exchange nutrients in a system of that helps the ecosystem use all its resources efficiently. Plants start if off by converting sunlight into plantlife they fill with nutrients and calories, herbivores then eat the plants turning it into animal tissue, and predators eat herbivores preventing them from eating too many plants, and decomposers break everyone down to re-nourish the biomass the plants grow from. Each segment has a check and balance to be sure the food chain keeps moving. For example, plants have fire, herivores have predators, predators have starvation, and decomposers have to wait for life to die. A balanced food chain is the goal of every ecosystem. When in balance an ecosystem can perpetually adapt.

Food chains run on efficiency. The lifeforms that use resources the most efficiently, can find their niche, and usually be left alone; because why compete with a niche if you can find your own? Life in a healthy ecosystem isn't a struggle that is nasty, brutish, and short, it's a struggle to find a niche. Sure the alpha male position, the good feeding spot on the river, protecting one's children, chasing down a fast gazelle, running away from the jackel, are survival moments. But most lions don't over kill their prey, just as like their prey don't down their predators for a reason. The ecosystem efficiency would suffer.

Most lifeforms die after living a life inside an ecosystem that lets them all prosper. There's a reason why captive animals run back into the wild when let free. They dream about helping the ecosystem keeping adapting. They're characters who don't want to miss out on their story.

Food chains have three big threats. Freeloaders, hoarders, and foreigners. Ecosystems need to harness every resource to increase they're carrying capacity. When a lifeform hoardes resources, the food chain stops. Stopping the flow of nutrients and calories stalls the system until it strikes back and reasserts accountability and reciprocation. Freeloaders are the same, they don't give back what they give, and therefore don't reciprocate. There aren't many examples of either in nature. It's hard to hoard food, and free-load.

Foreign lifeforms are a more common and serious threat. Foreigners can often be devastating because they're not integrated into a ecosystems food chains unique philosophy of accountability and reciprocation. Thus, while there's nothing inherently wrong with the emerald ash borer beetle, its still devastating to North America's ecosystem. The ash borer takes far more then it gives for the simply fact its larvae tunnel inside ash trees horizontally, and North American ash trees are adapted to insects tunneling vertically along its trunk. That one quirk from an obscure Asian beetle, will kill _all_ of North America's ash trees. Tens of millions of trees, and many ecosystems devastated because of one foreign beetle.

Other invasive species are the South American python in Florida swamps, the Asian carp in American rivers, zebra muscles from the Caspian sea in the Great Lakes. Thus, while all ecosystems share some resources via things like rainfall or animal migrations, ecosystems have to be mostly closed off and self-reliant to be sure their system of accountability and reciprocation keeps the ecosystem moving sustainably.

Life fights entropy best inside ecosystems. To make an ecosystem, life first mass producers simple lifeforms who fertilize a non-living area with biomass. Thereafter new lifeforms collaborate inside an ecosystem to maximize available resources. Each food chain has a specific ethic of accountability and reciprocation that rewards efficiency. Foreign lifeforms threaten a ecosystems balance, as do freeloaders and hoarders. Fast adaptations helps prevent problems, so we should learn more about them.

## Grandstory

The short study into life's evolution has a point. It's the grandstory we are apart of. And we often forget that. The invention and distribution of tools, whether biological or technological, is lives mission. And it's the most important mission any lifeform has. That's why we dream so much.

This is an especially important lesson for us. While our ruling philosophy tells us to keep consuming, and that will win the grandstory by itself. That's not always true. Life has stages, and requirements in the battle against entropy. The first stage is a land rush of grasses, weeds, and ferns. All of whom are simple lifeforms, that at least guarantee life is alive. Thereafter, life can take some to evolve better tools. Evolution happens inside ecosystems, because defined borders and members lets life enforce  checks and balances, to keep each lifeform accountable, and be sure each reciprocates. Each new lifeform helps life endure more attacks by entropy.

Life needs to get more powerful lifeforms. Lifeforms use each other to get there. Thus while each lifeform is a protagonist to itself, some play evolutions antagonist. Without the ability to reason, life has to make some of its lifeforms antagonists. Thus, while entropy attacks with natural disasters, life attacks itself with disease, plagues, thievery, murder and so forth down the list of sins.

Reason, however lets humans learn abstract rules, and make technology to counter all of entropy, whether natural disasters or lifeforms, proactively. Thus, we can prevent fires with fire breaks, drywall, or flame retardant clothing. We can design buildings to withstand earthquakes. We can design tsunami warning systems. We can clean wounds to prevent infections, and make vaccines for diseases. We kill these antagonists be realizing what they are, and making tools to thwart them. All because reason lets us understand abstract rules. And now revolutions, caused by our inability to see our ruling philosophys within the grandstory of life, can also be mastered.

Without techvolution, some humans are bound to be Darth Vader. To take on the role of antagonist, in order to push life along in the grandstory of making tools to defeat entropy. That's why Charles I, or Louis XVI, wouldn't just leave their thrones, remove their dresses, or stop their banquest and balls. Their insistence of their divine right to rule, their celebration of it was so unreasonable, that it caused the violent transition to a political ecosystem we call democracy. Without the "vaccine" of techvolution, clicking people to becoming Darth Vader is lives way of forcing evolution on humanity. Now we can see all this, and bring about reasonable revolutions called techvolution, by mapping the grandstory.

## Mapping Revolutions

You ever see old maps. The ones on material like animal hides showing the Roman Empire, or the New World. Except Italy is way too big, Ireland is missing, and the New World is just Cuba and some of Florida. I always found it funny. How the heck did people get around back then. They did their best, journeyed in the dark, through self-sacrifice, gave us the knowlege to build good maps.

Well the same goes for revolutions. We could never map them, until we knew what the heck they were through experience. And here is the map of them, based on our experience. We'll be using Aristotle's poetics, and mixing it with life's march of technology, so see revolutions.

## Camels in the Amazon

If you were to see camels in the Amazon, polar bears in Syria, tree frogs in Mongolia, or desert fox in the Arctic you'd automatically see something wrong. Not with the lifeform, we take our kids to visit these cuties in the zoo, but you'd see a mix-match of a lifeform in a foreign ecosystem.

Now when you see SUV’s in Shanghai, daily newspapers in England, American McMansions, coal power-plants in the Sunshine State, and another Spider Man playing throughout the world, you wouldn't the same mix-match. Even though England has few paper mills, China no oil fields, or Americans having no desire build and clean their own mansions. You wouldn't see the same mix-match between lifeform/adaptation and it's ecosystem, because you wouldn't see foriegn lifeforms because you wouldn't see different ecosystems, as you automatically do with a camel in the Amazon.

That's because right now, our society is stuck in the grandstory. We're still in the immediate growth part of economics where the factories were designed to make as many grasses, weeds, and ferns, to secure life against entropy. The stiff competition, and ownership of property rights are exactly what happened in politics, and thus in economics. With politics it happened after Clovis (453) I to Charlemagne (800) secured Western Europe after Rome's collapse. To create the grasses, weeds, and ferns, humanity was forced into strict roles of feudal king, priest, knight, gentry, and peasant. This how feudalism fostered the beginnings of political life. The nobilities descendants then passed on their political control right via inheritance, despite the fact the political situation was much different by 1500. Europe actually had enough political freedom, enough political "carrying capacity" because technological we achieved secure government, mass education, easy personal protection. To fully use this technology, humanity had to adapt against itself. Thus, the noility played the antagonist, so human could fight for political ecosystems via revolutions.

The scientific, political, and industrial revolutions kept making more technology, more lifeforms, that kept empowering life. More locomotion, more senses, more intelligence, and more reason. We kept on improving life on Earth, kept entropy at bay with natural disasters and diseases. We mastered ever more topics like gravity, human antonmy and war. Our enlightenment kept taking tools away from entropy. Which is really to say, life suffers entropy because of its own ignorance.

So many technological lifeforms have us enough carrying capacity to make economic grasses, weeds, and ferns. According to nature we let economics being owned by the first characters to find prosperity. We encouraged their growth via economic property ownership, which was to be passed on via inheritance. And like in nature, and politics, once we had enough carrying capacity, we will start making economic ecosystems.

But like with political ecosystems, democracy, we don't see the natural transition to an economic ecosystem. So we have people, well intentioned people who think they're protagonists, being the antagonist. Let's pick up the movie studio head, the guy who said internet streaming was criminal. Do you think he'd buy back all those DVD's he was selling in 2009. What value do the loyal consumers get? You can't give away DVD's ten years later.

So while the American middle class is under a huge recession, with massive layoffs, regular people are criminal for using a technology that saves hundreds of dollars, and never loses its value like a DVD. Do you think Fox Media Corportation treated its stock price with so much foresight.

The fact Netflix was fought against is a simple way to show how individuals work for entropy by antagonism technological upgrades. Yet, we do this throughout our entire world economy. And we suffer for it way more than movie watchers.

North America designs all its cities based on a automoble being the primary source of transportion. Even though, like with DVD vs internet streaming, we don't have to physically travel to watch movies, attend a lecture, pick groceries, work on a spreadsheet.

We design and mass produce houses without self-sufficient solar and wind energy, because all houses mass production is more important then self-sufficiency. Even though life specifaclly places higher value on smarter, more self-sufficient lifeforms. So Florida, Arizona, and the rest of the Sunbelt spends far more money on gas powered cars and homes, despite not having much oil at all.

Life wants us to form economic ecosystems like it wants to stop a meteor from hitting the Earth. The recent history of housing market collapses, auto industry bailouts, calling the first internet streamers thieves, migrant crisis, European and American nationalism, increasing trade tarriffs, Trumps Wall, are all ways life is trying to use its lifeforms to be antagonists, to create enough problems, so we eventually have a revolution and create economic ecosystems.

However, addicted to the ruling philosophy of liberal global free-market economics, we're unwilling to separate ourselves into ecosystems, all with their own version of accountability/reciprocation, borders, and members and foriegn species, that forces lifeforms to collaboration to maximize every local resources, we are live without an ecosystem. Which makes us all essentially camels trying to live in the Amazon.

The ones who suffer aren't the ruling nobility. It's the extras lives wants to force into a violent revolution. The ones who aren't clicked to be antagonist, are free to be protagonist. If they accept the new area of human reasoning, and realize revolutions are just another field of human understanding we can master. If the extras techvolutionize.
