# CHAPTER TWO - THE BACKSTORY

## Introduction

The American Revolution was finally over. After 18 years of war, the divine British nobility swallowed their pride, admitted they lost. The and met their once colonial subjects in France to sign the Treaty of Paris in 1783. Of course the British were too proud to sit for the official painting with the "commoner" Americans. It didn't matter; America was the protagonist who rose above the ruling philosophy, changed it, and won a free country with a ruling philosophy of "all men are created equal".

This is your ruling philosophy today. The one you need to change with techvolution. Here's the backstory of prior changes to tell us how that should look.

## Roman Swords, Scrolls, and Stones

To understand our current ruling philosophy of blue vs red, we must understand what it replaced. And that's the divine rights of the nobility.

Humanity was biologically the same 2,000 years ago. Technologically our most advanced civilizations were in the iron age. Tools were all hand powered like swords, chisels, and shovels, with some animal power like oxen and horses. Not much to farm, build roads, buildings, sanitation systems, scrolls, and everything else civilizations need.

The best civilzation was ancient Rome. Early Imperial Rome used the tools of the day very successfully. So successful the time between 27-180 is called the _Roman Peace_; a time of peace and prosperity that attracted millions to Rome's excellent roads, ordered cities, fresh water, steady food, relative safety, common language, single currency, valued citizenship, entertaining culture, effective military, and most importantly, stable politics.

Rome's ruling philosphy was a reflection of its tools. Harsh discipline made it's soldiers nearly unbeatable. Love of practical engineering let it build well ordered cities and roads throughout Europe. It's leadership felt responsible for the welfare of its citizens. Rome's religion honoured stories concerned with politics and morality, and how an individual's personal integrity relates to his or her responsibility to the community or Roman state. Most of all Rome's ruling philosophy was practicality.

Success however created huge problems. After 180, Rome controlled the entire Mediterranean basin, had many different peoples, and suffered huge infighting. All this made Rome very hard to govern. In 380, after cenutires of civil wars and general decline, Emperor Theodosius I thought he needed to re-unify Romans. He used the once outlawed Christianity. Unlike using race, or class, Christianty let anyone be a member. Thus, it was made the official State Church ordered to changed Rome's ruling philosophy.

It half worked. Rome was divided between West and East. The East, capitaled at Constantinople did well under Christianity, and lasted for another thousand years. The West did not. It limped on in bureaucratic corruption, military in-fighting, and population decline until 476 when it was sacked by another Germanic barbarian invasion for good.

Western Rome's provinces became German "Babarian Kingdoms" with nominal alligiance to Constantinople. When Islamic conquests inn 600-700 severed the ties with the Eastern Empire, Roman provinces in Western Europe had to find their own identity. This was the birth of Western Civilization, and the divine rights of nobles.

## Noble Swords, Scrolls, and Stones

Roman civilization, from infrastructure, administration, and military, was no more. Western Europe had to start its own civilization from scratch. Germanic tribes fought each other for control. The big winners were Franks, Anglos, and Saxons. They turned their small tribes into large kingdoms of England, France, and Switzerland.

Still in the Iron Age, they had the same tools as Rome did. Hand tools, swords, and some oxen and horses. To unify their peoples the German tribal leaders used the one Roman institution still around; the Roman Catholic Church. During the The Dark Ages, Germans slowly converted themselves, and everyone else they could, to Christianity. Using Rome's religion let German tribal leaders unite their conquered tribes, and get them to work. They justified nobility by saying God was everyone's father, and thus a male king, is God's representative on Earth.  Western European had an identity and ruling philosophy.

The people bought into this ruling philosophy for their self-interest. The average person had no books, no guns, no electricity. They had farming with hammer, plow, and buckets of water. They needed peace to grow their good, and protection from someone stealing it.

The Germanic kings like Clovis I, Alfred the Great, Charlemagne, gave that to them. They were great military and administrative leaders who defeated raiding Vikings, invading Arabs, roaming vandals, and slowly returned civilization to a chaotic land. The people slept better. Ate better. And saw their children grow up more often.

Nobles divinity was a reality. Today we call it feudalism. A rigid social hierarchy with the king, church, nobles on top. And gentry, merchants, and peasants, below. Everyone believed the kings earned the crowns on their heads. It's just too bad the nobles descendants thought divinity was in their blood, and not in their accomplishments. Either way, the basis for the nobles divinity was laid in the civilization's resurrection in Western Europe.

## Now What

Now what. What's the natural course of action. Would the leaders emulate Athenian democracy, or Roman Republicism and return citizenship, rights, and dignity to the masses? Nope. Not least because they didn't know about that stuff; they had few books back then. And besides, Athens and Rome were small towns when they experimented with their unique ruling philosophies, and worse neither ruling philosophy lasted that long anyway. The Kingdoms of Western Europe were huge and had millions of subjects. All of who depended on feuldalism to survive. So no changes were made to society's dependable ruling philosophy. Noble divinity stayed absolute.

Europe didn't have much time to think about it anyway. Everything went to hell starting in 1317 when Europe entered into the terrible Late Middle Ages. Europe had several huge faminines, large peasant revolts, and the Black Plague; all of which killed half the population in a few decades. Although there were still technological innovations, like the printing press, the English longbow, and the first cannon's. Life wasn't very good for the average person between 1300-1453.

Thus, as increasingly better tools were developed, Darth King didn't distribute their powers. The divine rights of nobility stayed the same, and had many features we'd recognize today. The noble's divine right to rule, no equality, the joining of church and state, peasants with no right to arm themselves, no free-speech, no religious toleration, and the Holy Bible as the supreme authority on every question for biology, astronomy, and every other question in society.

Unfortunately, there wasn't a happy ending to this fairy tale. Each stake of the ruling philosophy would die byway of revolution.

## Greek Philosophy Asked the Question

To start a revolution, needs to ask a question. Europe got that power in 1453. That's when (Eastern) Rome finally fell to the Turks, and Greek philosophy scholars flooded into still superstituous Western Europe. These Greeks supercharged the young Renaissance. If you've ever visited Vatican City, Florence, or Milan you've seen the huge changes Western Europe was in for.

The Greek philosophy of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle teaches many things. Some of it turned out to be wrong, like the Earth being the centre of the Universe, but Greek Philosophy is still the most important thing to learn in human history. Because no philosophy will always be right, the important thing is to be honest about mistakes, learn from them, and if need to, good deep and question the philosophy you had when making a mistake. The ability to self-correct makes a philosophy great.

In all of human history so far, Greek philosophy is the best at questioning everything, most of all, itself. Probably because it was started by Socrates, who pissed off the rulers in Athens so much they put him on trial for "irreligion and corrupting the youth". During his trail Socrates responded by saying he should get a state pension. Instead the executed him. Thus, Greek philosophy's lets anyone, question anything. Getting persecuted for breaking the rules is a compliment.

Thus, when Greek philosophy arrived in Western Europe it asked profound questions and starting calling bullshit a lot. This was good. What was better, was when Europe had more tools to collect more information of the natural world. The most important was the printing press (1439), musket (1500), telescope (1608) and microscope (1610). These, and so many others, helped protagonists not only question the ruling philosophy, but revolutionize it. Because we finally had the real answers about nature, using science.

![Philosophy Questions](img\thewriter\triangle-the-matrix.png)

## Science

The first modern protagonist was Niccolo Machiavelli (1469-1527). He was born was poor, but his father got him many books from the recent printing press, and mixing a commoner upbriging with new tools, proved itself again to be a recipe for protagonism.

Machiavelli read much Greek and Roman history and philosophy and soon thought religion was over used in his time. This helped him be the first person to see through Europe's ruling philosophy. Machiavelli foresaw a new ruling philosophy where humanity overcomes problems, by using human reason to build new tools. Religion was a crutch, and now an especially unneeded crutch for a society with the printing press and scientific instruments. Humanity could master the many misfortunes of nature with new tools.

If, Machiavelli said, humanity were to wise up, and ignored the "imagined world" of the old ruling philosophy and judge human actions for their "effectual truth" on making the real-world better or not based on the problems on the frontline. Machiavelli appreciated Christianity once brought civlization back to Europe. But new tools need new ruling philosophies. Something he called new "modes and orders".

People the call for "effectual truths" was answered. A chorus of people started to question the ruling philosophy in astronomy, religion, medicine, politics, and more. As ever more technologies got invented and adopted throughout Europe, scientists like Francis Bacon developed the Scientific Method, which was a systematic way to test and find effectual truth. Starting with Copernicus's _On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres_, scientists like Galileo, Kepler and Newton overcame much religious opposition from the ruling philosophy when they participated in the Scientific Revolution (1543-1687.

There were many battles, but scientific truths replaced religious ones inside Western Civilization's scienctific DNA. And Christianity was itself liberated from having to answer questions it simply wasn't meant to. Alas, it was these scientists, inspired by Machiavelli, who set the standard for furture movements against the divine rights of the nobility ruling philosophy.

![Effectual Truth Diagram](img\thewriter\triangle-the-matrix.png)

## Political Protagonists in The Age of Enlightenment

The Scientific Revolution discovered many wondrous details of the universe. Things like the Earth revolves around the Sun, human anatomy, and the laws of motion. Scientists made using the Holy Bible the basis of all human thought look silly. While most of these scientists were faithful Christians in their personal beliefs, they advocated using science as humanity's new and improved ruling philosophy for understanding how the natural world worked. They were thus revolutionaries.

And it was in their tradition of questioning the natural world, that spawned the Age of Enlightenment (1687-1789). The Enlighenment was when humanity itself "wised up" by directing scientific questions to better understand not just physical nature, but human nature.

Now Thankfully, it wasn't long before dress wearing, banquest obsessed, cake eating, self-described divine nobles, were under the spotlight of effectual truth.

Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679), writing during the chaos of the English Civil Wars, started the long process to give Europe a new political ruling philosophy. He started it by defending an absolute monarchy, saying a super strong government is the cure against chaos. Hobbes said everyone should obey one king, who he called Leviathan, to avoid the anarchy that makes human life that is "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." This was revolutionary.

Because how Hobbes justified his nobility was monumental. Like Machiavello, Hobbes disliked religion, so he didn't use the "divine right to rule". Instead, he said humanity is naturally, in our State of Nature, equal. The State of Nature is a place without government, where we're all equal because... well whose to say otherwise. Hobbes biggest proof of our equality is, without government, we can all kill each other with our ability to scheme, plot, and murder. So to keep everyone from killing each other, the people should forfeit their natural rights of equality to a Leviathan to ensure everyone's security.

Thus, _the King_ and _the People_, would have a social contract with each other. One based on equality, that ends in complete tyranny, but that guarantees everyone's security, which as we've learned before is the soil that grows a healthy civilization. This reasoning, believe it or not, started the liberalism that we have today. From constitutions, to the right to own property like race cars, and the right to control ones body with abortions, all guaranteed by the social contract between the people, and Leviathan, or what we call government. Guaranteed if these rights didn't threaten the country's all important security.

We'd recognize Leviathan better after reading John Locke (1632-1704). Locke says it's too idealistic to expect one person to be Leviathan. If power corrupts, then absolute power corrupts absolutely. Thus, Locks says its best to divide government's Leviathan powers up in executive, legisative, and judicial branches. Each would "check and balance" each other, to prevent a government that's worst than the anarchy it's supposed to get rid of.

Locke's philosophy is behind our written constitutions, bills of rights, elected governments, citizens right to bear arms, checks and balances between executives, elected legislatures, lawful judges, freedom of speech, and freedom of religion. Mass printed books, guns, scientific instruments and many others, were enshrined by Locke into society's ruling philosphy, via constitutions, which finally replaced the Holy Bible as society's ultimate reference guide for our ruling philosophy. Most people today live under Locke's Leviathan.

## Revolutions

Rousseau (1712-1778) liked, but disagreed with, Locke and Hobbes. Yes, humanity is naturally equal, but said humanity is only murderous in a society. If a thinker goes back farther into human nature and history, they'd find happy-go-luck hunter gatherers who weren't filled with the envy, jealously, or anxiety of modern humans living under unnatural ruling philosophies. This is where the Rousseau's new philosophy, "Man is born free; but everywhere he is in chains" that we discussed earlier came from. Rousseau says yes society needs a social contract, but one that harnesses the natural goodness of humanity.

Rousseau thus keeps Hobbes' social contract, but wants to create a new person to live inside it. Rousseau's Leviathan is not concentrated into a single person, or even a checked and balanced government, but is distributed throughout society via direct democracy. Meaning there are no representatives of government inside a nobility, or a elected representatives. Instead, all people who live under the all powerful Leviathan, also control the Leviathan.

To have this new society, requires a totally "new person". Someone who can give responsible commands to society, while accepting the rules society gives back.

Once Locke and Rousseau's ideas spread, nation states emerged from the feudal kingdoms. Wars continued to decline, because once the extras fighting the wars on the battlefield, is ruling their society, they don't tend to want more wars than absolutely necessary. Empowering the people breeds collaboration not competition.

Politically free democracies, while not uniform, or everywhere, are now the norm in the world. The ruling philosophy dreamed by Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau, was also dreamed by many Cinderella's, and made real by the people into a new ruling philosophy with many revolutions. Now Cinderella just needed her glass slipper.

Minuteman, fought for free. They're the cousins of open-source....

## Your Ruling Philosophy

Humans keep solving problems. We invented new tools to solve political insecurity, mastering nature, and the ruling philosophies this tools need to prosper. The reason we spent so much time understanding the rise and fall of kingdoms, is because this story is very similar to ours, except this time kingdoms were called companies.

Here is where your own ruling philosophy comes from. One that mixes the political freedoms of Lock, Rousseau and Jefferson, but includes the philosophy of economic kingdoms that share much in common with their deceased political cousins. Our ruling philosophy is called liberal free-market economics. It has political liberties and freedoms, but also strict economic obligations of feudal hierachies that replaces the "nobles divine rights to rule", with its "divine rights of property owners". And, in the human timeline you are politically free, but economically bound in chains, in pre-revolution American and France, waiting for a Rousseau to inspire you to freedom.

## Our Rulng Philosophy - Part I - Free Markets

Towards the end of feudalism, Europe invented some cool technology. Among them was the quadrant, sandglass, nocturnal, and most important, the huge "ships of sail" you've seen in pirate movies. All this technology meant ships could store lots of food and water, navigate at night, and travel against the wind.

For a few centuries, Western European countries used these new tools to turn their kingdoms into empires. Portugal, Spain, France, England raced to colonize the world, and set-up merchantalism to expand their economies. Colonies like the Americas, India, Brazil, sent their abundant natural resources to the home country, who sent back finished goods. Importantly, home countries never traded with other home countries. To increase their economic strenth, they warred to expand their colonies. Market share meant colonial size.

Happily two protagonists eventually called merchantalism bullshit; Adam Smith (1723-1790) and David Ricardo (1772-1823). These enlightenment thinkers realized to rid the world of poverty, society needed to create much better tools, and that meant massive concentrations of resources into new castles called factories. Factories are the centres of power for the new economic kingdoms/companies.

However, one hiccup was borders. No country, no matter how big, could ever have enough resources to build all these new factories. Thus for any country to conquer poverty with companies and factories, they needed to share the burden. They did this by starting a new ruling philosophy to let companies conquer poverty, Europe needed to open the political borders. Only a world without economic borders would let the world unite inside the ruling philosophy of world wide economic growth.

Smith and Ricardo killed merchantalism with "free-market economics" using mathematics. They discovered trade between countries, who each fostered their own companies and factories, would enable much more production and thereby grealy increase the wealth of all nations. The happens with economic specialization via "comparative advantage". The math shows if countries build companies and factores that only make a few products, like England with textiles companies and Germany with toolmaking companies, they can produce more stuff of a higher quality. Even if a country could be self-sufficient, it still mathematically makes sense to build specialized factories, mass-produce, and trade. Free-market economics was the fastest way to grow the new technologies that would conquer the economic anarchy causing the world's poverty.

When countries slowly opened their borders to trade, a company, a entity seperate from political control, was allowed to operate whereever it wanted to. Barriers like borders, language, culture didn't get in the way. Now, like seeds blowing in the wind, whichever markets a company could reach, grow in, and estabilsh themselves, they could compete in.

Unsurprisingly, the First Industrial Revolution (1760-1840), swept through the world on the back of free-market economics. New inventions kept getting invented. For the first time since animals were domesticated and steel was forged, humanity had access to fundamentally new tools; machines, chemicals, the loom, steam power, water power, and the rise of the mechanized factory system.

Countries moved from basic farming and scrapping by, to building factories that opened up a new world. Farmers, the descendents of feuldal peasants, moved from their small plots of land, to get jobs inside massively growing cities. Factories, and soon office buildings, replaced castles as the bringers of security. Those people who got inside, i.e. were hired, were protected from economic uncertainty. People lined up, hoping to get the chance to obey their new economic nobility inside a economic social contract. If workers help grow the economy, they can do whatever they want with their payment. Which was usually buy stuff like a stove, car, radio, or computer, and fuel more growth.

The companies that won the marketshare were like Charlemagne. John D. Rockefeller (1839-1937) and his Standard Oil, Andrew Carnegie (1835-1919) and his U.S. Steel Corporation, and J.P. Morgan (1837-1913) and his J.P. Morgan. New tools kept coming. Tractors, water pumps, vaccines, cars, calculators, all had new factories, with new kings like Henry Ford (1863-1947), Bill Hewlett (1913-2001), David Packard (1912-1996), and Thomas Edison (1847–1931) and many other kings sat atop of new kingdoms for cars, power generation, electrical components, and telecommunications.

These economic kingdoms had a hierarchy like feudalism. Like nobles wrote laws to own whatever happened in their land, company owners do the same. They owned the property, the tools, the products, the copyrights, and freely decided who will access their castle/factory/office building.

The protectors of the econoimc realm were brigades of lawyers, accountants, and university graduates, defended and attacked other kingdoms using the laws and finances of massive corporations. The gentry were the host of superviors and branch managers supposed to keep the people in line.

The people were the masses, who wilfuly, and rightfully, forfeited their natural rights of equality, to the new kingdom, in return for economic security. They ran the machines, built the power stations, used the computers, which was pumping out so many poverty killing technology and tools.

Oh, what about the priests. Where are the ones telling everyone in the system to stay in their lane. Where are the ones converting non-believers to the holy word of free-market economics. Say hello to the economists on CNBC. The "C" might as well stand for Catholic.

Like factories liberated people from their feudal roles of baker, or copper, as economics kept getting more secure, more people upgraded their roles. The "self-made" started to rule economics. Now when somebody asked "what do you do for a living" they were really asking "what do you do for a living". Increasinly, Cinderella dreamed of starting her own company, inventing a new tool, and becoming self-made, and hosting her own banquets and balls.

Free market economics worked. That's why its spread across the globe, and survived even as the political empires that brought it have long fallen by way of political revolutions. And that's why free-market economics is one half of your ruling philosophy.

## Our Rulng Philosophy - Part II - Liberalism

The second half of our ruling philosophy is liberalism. Here enter's the infamous conservatives and progressives. While they hate each other today, they both share the same purpose; what's the best way to manage economic growth inside democracies.

Conservatives have their own answer, originally written by Edmund Burke in 1790. Conservatism values tradition, and only wants prudent changes learned from practical experience. Conservatives thus want to slowly distribute the political and economic power of the rich and powerful.

The father of progressives is John Stuart Mill who wrote progressvism in 1859. Mill's the opposite of Burke. While Burke says go slow and steady, Mill says the oppressed person shound't be patient with their oppression. Liberty, and the progress towards more liberty, should thus be extended now to minorities, the needy, the oppressed, etc.

This choice between going slow like a consevative, and going fast like a progressive is seen in every political issue in western politics. Like the economy they fight over, they spread the world. The color alternates, but red and blue politics spreads the world like the economic power they fight over.

From health-care reform, to immigration, to gay marriage, to tax-policy, stock-market regulation, to everything. However, since conservatives and progressives agree on world wide econoimc growth, they together make up the second half of our ruling philosophy

And this comes down to the tools they use. Suburban housing, cars, office buildings, factories, stock markets, banks, paperwork, all of this creates the ruling philosophy, not viccersa. That's why liberalism, is the other half of your ruling philosophy. After the end of World War II, its slowly spread throughout the world, and has been responsible for the _Long Peace_, the time reminscent of the _Roman Peace_. Doesn't meant ours will end, but it's healthy to think all good things come to an end.

Why Techvolution, the proactive changing of society, is a lesson for the one you just read. We must change our ruling philosophy to reflect the new digital tools we have today.
