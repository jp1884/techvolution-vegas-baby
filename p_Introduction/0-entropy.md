- Mention cells, as Life's composables. All of which are devoted problem-solvers.

This book changes the world. The place where we all live and breath. A place that's been the setting for every living thing's entire life.

But where is Earth's setting.

Earth exists inside a Universe where life is not the master. Rather life is the weird one.

The laws of physics rules the Universe. Life is powerless to change them. Tiny electrons, protons, neutrinos mix together and make atoms such as hydrogen, iron, and copper. These atoms make water, metal, atmosphere, and rock. Atoms and elements make stars, comets, and planets. Even life uses atoms to build itself, every piece of iron what made inside a star's supernova, that means the iron in your blood right now too. Life is made of stardust.

And it all falls apart. But life is subject to the laws of physics, such as gravity, the conservation of energy, and our topic right now is entropy. If Evil had a name in science, it would be entropy.

Life loves to grow. Entropy is still there. Like a mean school teacher, the rule of Entropy must also be followed. Once the life cannot generate new cells faster enough, it dies, and entropy is there to decompose the back into the atoms that made it.

The story of Life is a constant fight against Entropy. It steals our buildings, monuments, ships. It robs us of our loves, hopes, and dreams. When we dream of Heaven, it's a place with everything in this Universe, stars, comets, mountains, moon; but no entropy. Folklore, religion, ideology, are all ways to help humans band together and fight the universal villian, Darth Entropy.

Our stories idolize heroes and saviors because they help us fight the hunger, thirst, and death Entropy is always throwing at us. Like all the comets, planets, and stars in the Universe, all eventually decompose into their atoms. You, me, and everyone else is no different.

The measure of a lifeform is how well it helps life fight off Entropy. If a lifeform can't harvest resources fast enough to keep entropy away, Life uses evolution to form a new being that's given a chance to play. Likewise, every person, culture, and ideology is subject to the same rules. Help life prosper or make way for another. If Life were God, it would be amazing, yet it would also have a side intolerant of non believers.

You know this story. It's the story of life. Everday you must find water and food to fuel your body. You need warmth or shade to regulate your temperature. And most of all, your need companions on the same mission.

Entropy is out to kill us all.

This book is about you finding some friends to fight back.
