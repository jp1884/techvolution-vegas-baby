Techvolution A New Philosophy
It's almost time to party

(manuscript September 2022)

Have you been to a good banquet lately? One where ladies shimmer in elegant dresses, gentlemen move in tailored suits, and the hall is decorated so beautifully it makes your soul smile. I'm talking about the kind of night that builds your anticipation, sparks your imagination, and gets everyone dancing, joking, and visiting the bartender for another round.

Banquets like these make life easy to love. I hope you get to enjoy one soon. As we live through pandemics, job losses, inflation, and war, we could all use a good night out.

Sadly, it might be hard to let loose and forget our troubles. Rather than bringing us together to solve our problems, as it's supposed to, politics in the Western world is driving us either crazed or hopeless.

We won't enjoy too many good nights out until we fix that.

To fix our politics, we must go to the root of the subject. Although its most known for arguments and protests, laws and rules, a much more critical force exists behind the scenes of politics.

Before a group of people can argue about the rules in places like courts or television shows, they must create rules. But before a group of people can create rules, they must first share a philosophy.

Every community shares a philosophy. Sports teams have philosophies like "win at all costs," while businesses might have a "maximize profit" philosophy. A group's philosophy is often unspoken in day-to-day life but underpins every member's thoughts and actions. Only when people share a philosophy can they share a similar outlook, form a group, socialize, do business, and create rules to achieve the mission of their philosophy. 

Let's look at a banquet to see the power of philosophy over our lives. Just think about all the decisions made when organizing a party. What's the dress code? What food and drinks to serve? Who should get invited? Who should stand guard? Who's paying for it all? And most importantly, who makes the decisions?

Now think of the differences between weddings. There’s religious ones with hours of formal ceremonies, modest weddings held in small halls with only close friends and family in attendence. Think of the difference between a lavish and religious Indian wedding to a wedding between two vegans.

Each party celebrates a wedding, but because each party is organized by people who believe in a different philosophy, their banquets are very different too. But most people at the wedding will understand or agree with the decisions because they’re all part of the same community and therefore believe in the same philosophy that the organizers used when making decisions about the banquet.

Now imagine making decisions an entire country must agree on. The choices of a wedding are tiny compared to the list of choices a nation must make: what to teach kids, what calendar to use, how to manage the monetary system, who's in charge, who's paying for it all, etc.

The lesson to learn is people in any society, from banquet guests to citizens of a country, need a philosophy to guide their choices. Although other areas like religion and literature can do that, it’s explicitly political philosophies that tell people what to think, inspire rules of everyday life, and justify enforcing those rules with education or force.

For example, there were no designer dresses and tuxes at a banquet in the old Soviet Union because Soviet philosophy said lavish wealth was fundamentally wrong. Cinderella, a farm girl, needed a fairy godmother to get into the prince's ball because she did not have the "noble birth" her society said guests needed.

Even though every society is bound by a philosophy, it is taken for granted, hard to see, and often unspoken. A society’s philosophy is expressed in fragments with ideologies; such as our Conservative, Progressives, Feminists, and Nativists. Ideologies all share much in common and agree to the rules that govern our elections, courts, economy, etc.

So our ideologies debate for our society’s government offices with arguments in books, radio shows, and cable news. When reason doesn't work, fear and ridicule are the next options. That's why you'll hear television hosts, and Twitter feeds say "controversial," "provocative," and "unbelievable" so often. These words paint the other side as stepping out of bounds of our society's mostly unspoken philosophy.

Even with all the drama in society, there isn't much at stake in daily politics. Most big daily decisions are made by the political philosophy people already believe. It’s like Game of Thrones, where several noble families 

So that’s the lesson to learn. Like any banquet, daily politics is entertaining, but the true power to change anything about the party is rooted in the philosophy your society believes in. Because, when there is a decision to make in daily politics, it's done by those with the power to pull the lever.

—

A society’s political philosophy answers most daily questions for the people inside. Cinderella would have had a much easier time getting a ball in our society then hers that emphasized bloodlines so much. Even though political philosophy are so powerful, there are still big decisions to make in society. Everyday politics in town halls and coffee shops answer some, but the people with the most influence control the necessities like the electrical grid, medical system, educational system, banking system, etc. These people have a hand on a "lever of power" in society.

Look at exclusive banquets in any country, and you'll see who controls its levers. You'll see kings and queens, generals and presidents, moguls and executives. These authority figures have power far beyond a single voice. They decide where to put factories, where to drill for oil, how much immigration/emigration is allowed, whether to increase interest rates, and so much more.

The power brokers control leves of power and they host the most elegant banquets.

But don’t dispair, the guest list of this banquets often changes. The list is for us today. Our established banquets, once beloved a few decades ago, for example, the Oscars, are now "not the cool kids anymore." Old hollywood losing it’s grip on society’s entertainment “lever”. Tesla is likewise battling for the transportion lever right now.

So even though philosophies are the true power broker, there is still much competition within philosophies as people battle to control the levers of power in a society. Even so, taking control of a lever is awfully hard, and is a true David versus Goliath battle where Goliath usually wins.

—

And we return to our original point; fixing our broken politics. We could join the fun and drama of daily politics, but while it's entertaining, cable news programs and Twitter feeds don't solve inflation or unaffordable housing.

We could fight to contorl the levers of power to improve how things like interest rates or housing by-laws are created. But taking control of levers of power is tough and it usually fails.

So, how to change our fate? How can we fix our politics and make our society benefit us more?

If we want to change the banquet of our life, we must rethink the political philosophies we believe in. Only with a new framework will we bring civility back into our politics and get new answers to improve our everyday lives.

Only with a new political philosophy will we build a better society.

This book is a new political philosophy. It's a new framework to give modern answers to the same fundamental questions humans have been asking for generations. Questions like what food we should eat, transportation to use, and entertainment to enjoy. If we don’t like the banquet we’re living, only a new philosophy will create meaningful change.

If this book was written for academics, it would be a dissertation full of references. If it was for bureaucrats, it would be a policy paper packed with diagrams. If it were written for ideologues, it would be sold for profit and have a book tour.

It's none of those (although I wouldn't mind going on a nice long trip). This book is a readable vision of the amazingly inclusive and productive society we can create today, written for anyone who wants to invent tomorrow now.

This book aims that high. It's also completely free, with two rules. First, you can't read this book if you're not willing to admit all of us are equally to blame for humanity's current problems.

All problems; from climate change to the migrant crisis—government debt to widespread mental illness.

There's no "them" to blame for our current state of affairs; we all need to do better. Placing blame is unhelpful, toxic, attracts self-righteousness, and discourages people admitting their problems and improving their choices. Building a better future is more important than placing blame.

Not blaming anyone for our problems means leaving behind a lot of baggage. 

So, if you're addicted to cable news, want to raise your hand and protest for change, are poor and want someone else to give you a better life, if you're rich and powerful but aren't willing to compete to get on the list of a new banquet, or if you're anyone similar, you can't read this book. 

This book's not for you anyway. The new philosophy aims to be transformative and change human civilization. If it doesn't, that's on me. If it does, evolution starts with you. And like any good therapist would say to any patient, you must leave the past behind you to create a better future.

Colonialism, wars, famines, uprisings, enslavement, no one's biology or technology is innocent of humanity's often evil past. Leaving the past in the past is contrary to today’s politics. But to solve today’s problems we must. After all, no one can eat the food of past decades. We should study our history and learn from it but leave it in the dust of our footsteps as we walk to the future. If you can't do that, please stop reading.

There's another group who shouldn't bother with this book; anyone with an ego. A new philosophy means change, and change shakes things up, and some individuals will lose out. The people at Blockbuster didn't all benefit when Netflix took over their market. But personal loss doesn't mean it's okay to resist technological improvements. If you are attached to being an executive vice president of a dying industry, a student activist of a dying education industry, you can't read this book.

Those are the two rules. No ideologues or egotists can read this book. You've got enough for-profit political products out there to keep you occupied.

Buy them and leave the dreamers to get to work.

This book is for a new person. One who grips modern tools to create custom-made solutions to today's frontline problems. This new person has no gender, race, career, religion, nationality, or loyalty to the past; she is faceless because she adapts to solve real problems and improve her society.

If you do read this book, your kids will thank you. At least you can say you did your part to make human society a better place to enjoy a party. When we're done, maybe the next generation will celebrate a banquet in your honor.

If you don't read this book. That's fine too. I deeply understand the powerful self-doubt that one person can change the future. But I  (painstakingly) wrote this book anyway to clear my conscience because while I can't invent tomorrow's technology, I can modernize our politics and thereby help new technology finally get adopted to improve life on Earth. And someone certainly needs to do that.

Now I'm going to ask a favor. If you do read this, you can't hate me for it. I'll try to remain anonymous, but if that fails and these words spark anger inside your soul that says you need to re-assess yourself and has nothing to do with me. Civilization has changed many times. Our ancestors had to change with it. You're no different. This new philsoophy isn’t a manifesto to inspire a revolution; it’s about getting to work. I avoid as many trigger words as possible, but this new philosophy is supposed to make you reflect on your job, your identity, your ideology, and the many other masks you wear.

You getting angry is a good sign this new philosophy is working. What you decide to do with that anger–evolve or go back to watching/complaining/ranting–is your choice. Whatever you choose, you can't blame me for offering you the chance.

If you can't live with that, please stop reading. Because the truth is our Earth is nothing by a tina struggling space station and it’s the only place life has a foothold on survival. If you can’t be bothered to change your opinions to help life prosper, then you might as well go back to your standard programming and watching the problems pile up while you stare into a Twitter feed looking for someone to annoy.

Okay, let's get started. Of course, creating a new shared understanding for society is a lot of work. On the bright side, this new philosophy is easy to learn and live by. As you'll soon understand, looking at the world in a different way enters your mind whenever you embrace the magic of new technology.

This new philosophy was written on a laptop, transmitted through fiber optics, stored in remote servers, and downloaded via WiFi. How wonderful are the digital tools technological evolution has given us.

Since you use modern technology, you already believe in this modern philosophy called Techvolution; you just don't know it yet.

You will after reading this book.

Cheers. 

P.S.
What a party the future can be.

This book will explain Techvolution in detail, but let me explain some of this new philosophy using the popular "equality vs. equity" meme.

The meme shows a family standing outside the walls of a baseball park. This event is not a banquet, but the principles are the same; there's a fun gathering, the people inside share a philosophy (of baseball), but spots are limited and this family didn’t meet the criteria for entry.

So, what options do the outsiders have?

This family decided to peek into the game (good on them). Sadly, the fence is about 5 feet, leaving one kid unable to see the action. 

Good thing there are three crates.

Well, maybe; it depends on how you answer the question, "how should we allocate these three crates?".

The possible answers are filtered through our society’s philosophy. On one side we have the the Conservative whose answer allocates one crate per person, which conservatives call equality. The Progressive solution gives two crates to the small kid and none to the father, which progressives call equity. A Conservative might say their ideology is being mocked here, however, this meme still shows how the Right and Left allocate resources differently.

This meme is a small example of the political battle going on every day in on television and Twitter. The Left and Right are constantly arguing over resources in the school system, healthcare, housing, baseball tickets, crates, etc.

Both sides say society benefits when supporting their answer. When neither side gives in, ideologues start calling names, singing to their choirs, and making wild accusations on social media.

It's so easy to get lost in the storytelling that you forget life has more than two answers.

Just look at this one meme. Many people today see this one meme and think they've got American politics all figured out. If your personality likes the stories of "equity," you'll think something like, "Only if Bernie Sanders were President, then all kids in America would get their education, house, food, their 'crate'; so we must fight!"

Or, on the flip side, if a person like the way "equality" ideology sounds, he might think, "The Progressives will steal all my property, savings, stocks, my 'crate' if they win; get ready for battle!".

A person doesn’t even need to back up their principles with their actions. Just watching the correct news channel supposedly makes a person a “hard working” conservative or a “fair minded” progressive. Modern politics is a fiction novel people read everyday. The contradictions are endless with such a separation of belief and reality. For example, many climate change activists fly around the world and free-market conservatives so easily take government handouts because real-life princinples are meaningless when politics is so fictious.

And this is what I mean by leaving the old ways behind. It's not that there's nothing to learn from Feminism, Progressivism, Conservatism, etc. They can teach us many things. Yet so can the world’s religions and we don’t let them control our politics. Today, the ideologues fight an almost religious war because neither is rooted in daily actions. Today’s ideoligies are old narratives looking for evidence.

You can do better because humanity must do better.

We can by asking questions. And that is the power of a new philosophy; it forces us to ask questions such as, shouldn't this family go to a place that wants their business? And if, for some reason, this family must watch this baseball game, are three crates the best solution to help them do it?

A new philosophy adds a blank page and forces us to think up new answers to our everyday problems. Because if this family does want to watch this baseball game, they shouldn't be stuck choosing between "equity" or "equality." 

After all, either option still only gives the family three crates. This father and kids should have their own tools, their own abilities, and the freedom to solve the problem themselves.

That's what old established ideologies, their infotainment, their pundits, and their mass-produced products–take from us. The fact you either act or you don't. And acting means using tools to fix your real-life problems. Be it expensive insurance bills, rising inflation, or outsourcing good jobs.

If people help you solve your problem, they're your friends. Not because of some superficial tribal community over ideology, race, or religion, but because you've worked together to help each other live better lives.

Humans naturally solve problems. Because hunger, cold, and danger forces all animals to adapt to their specific problem in their unique environment. Humans adapt with technology; thus, we're supposed to invent new tools to live more efficient lives by clearing debris from drains, planting a home garden, or turning the crates into a bleacher so everyone can watch the game.

And if a person couldn't build or buy a custom product to solve their specific problem, true politics would teach them how.

Here’s the rub. Neither the Left nor Right can teach you modern technology because they're devoted to an old way of life. This life is working in a large corporation or bureaucracy from 9-5. Living in a suburb, driving cars to get anywhere. And mass producing generic products like shoes, television shows, professional sports, houses, education, and crates, and telling us to be consumers of these generic products.

We’re so used to this lifestyle now, many Westerners have forgotten how to be seamstresses, shoemakers, craftsman, designers, or how to experience a problem and not expect government or big business to do something, but to solve the problem ourselves.

We’re missing out on so much adventure and accomplishment. Especially because we don’t understand modern digital technology can now create custom products to solve your specific local problems. The remarkable abilities of 3D printers, instant telecommunications, solar panels, and virtual reality to improve your individual life and today’s big societal problems are unseen to the Progressives and Conservatives and are therefore not included into your politics, as witnessned by this “equality vs. equity” meme that only gives a family three crates to solve their problem.

There's a reason why. You'll learn that soon. But the vital thing to know is Techvolution is a new philosophy and so it’s free to ask questions. That means there’s a blank page for us all to fill with new solutions.  

Techvolution learns from the past, and takes the best from the Left and Right, summed up in the mantra "local need solved by local greed." Let today's businessman make as much money as he wants. As long as he solves a local problem for the average person using local resources, which progressives rightfully demand.

When Techvolution is our political philosophy, we will solve local problems, improve our daily lives, fix our broken politics, and the middle-class will enjoy free-loving banquets and ball games again across the Western world.

And the best part is our future parties won't be putting up too many walls.
