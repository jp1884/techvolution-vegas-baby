# Techvolution A New Philosophy

Let's Go Camping
Politics is simple

In grade six, my class designed a space station. In groups of five or so, we got a big sheet of graph paper and were tasked to create whatever station we wanted. Every square represented water filters, air purifiers, sleeping areas, farms, engineering, or entertainment.

This space station had requirements. So much human population needs so much water, food, air, entertainment, etc. I always loved society-building games like Age of Empires, so I was excited to build the perfect space colony.

This being a space station, the challenge was to make the colony self-sufficient. Although it sounds simple, most civilizations don't find the right balance; go to places like Iraq or Greece today and see the ruins of several human space stations. It's sad, but almost all societies end up dying. My space colony did, and pretty darn quickly too.

I can't remember how the other groups fared, but my group's space colony ended on the vine. We suffocated ourselves. Instead of installing enough air filters, we packed entertainment "squares" into nearly half our space station. The space station turned into an extravagant banquet that was actually breathtaking.

I can still remember losing the argument to change our design. It was in the school hallway where I tried to explain why we needed more air filters. Looking back, my sustainability plan never stood a chance. I argued against people with a lifetime full of candy, parks, and television.

You might be saying, "oh, typical kids," but you'd be wrong.

My group wasn't typical kids; they were regular consumers. The space station project was supposed to get us thinking about humanity's future among the stars; instead, we defaulted to our upbringing and did what consumers do; enjoy life and leave it to someone else to work, supply, and pay for our lifestyle.

My grade 6 space station–flying through space with dwindling supplies and short-sighted occupants who party too much–is the perfect analog for today's society. We plan our society's housing, transportation, education, employment, and other sectors like my classmates did and assume Earth is the Garden of Eden with endless resources.

It's not. Our planet is a space colony flying through a Universe extremely hostile to life. Whatever resources we do have must be used effectively. If we don't, the party of life ends very quickly, as the many fossils of extinct lifeforms and civilizations show us.

Regardless of the ever-present danger of death, the lifestyle we're used to still drives our actions. Our morning routines, work habits, and celebration rituals surround us daily. The result is we don't care to evolve proactively. We know our way of life has problems, and we should improve our space station by lowering carbon emissions, reading more books, or even exercising regularly, but…

Our lifestyle says to consume stuff, so we buy and cherish flashier, larger, more expensive stuff and watch our problems pile up. A lifestyle is a tricky thing to change.

We inherited our lifestyle from the Baby Boomers. This generation grew up in the 1950s and 1960s, during the Golden Age of Capitalism (and Socialism too). This golden age had high employment, low-interest rates, cheap housing, and an easy suburban lifestyle. Most Americans still idolize this way of life and try to recreate it.

Times have, of course, changed. The low-hanging fruit of cheap gas, land, and labor that fueled the Golden Age of Capitalism are all picked. The baby boomers, of course, got older and refused to leave their golden age behind. Their huge demographic bulge means they've had the voting block and spending power to keep our culture fixated on the consumption that characterized their youth. Today, the retiring boomers and their lifestyle of picking the easy fruit are like an old-growth forest, sucking so many resources that their offspring struggle to find much light, water, or space to grow.

With such a prominent demographic bulge, baby boomers have overbearing control over the American lifestyle. As a result, today, the kids and grandkids of boomers have the same Left vs. Right politics, with the same equality vs. equity arguments. We have the same car culture, live in suburban houses, attend the same schools, have the same routine, 9-5 jobs, and corporate cultures.

Worst, the millennials and gen Xers have intensified the boomer culture. We'll discuss this more below, but because boomers refuse to let us pick higher fruit, our society can evolve to solve everyday problems. So we're stuck in the boomer economy and culture. They are leaving us to fight for our betterment with more heated politics. More intense economic arguments while consuming bigger houses, longer commutes, and more 9-5 jobs. Perhaps worst of all, to facilitate our consumer habits, our society works hard to avoid feeling the pain of paying for our party. Instead, we've borrowed more money, abused more cheap labor, and wasted more natural resources to keep the good times of pretend golden age of Capitalism (and Socialism, too) going.

And we're slowly realizing see our space station is suffocating. We've got too much carbon, exploding debt, decreasing social capital, and many other symptoms of decline.

Absent a new philosophy to identify our poor choices and help us harvest the fruit higher up the tree, we're left blaming "the other" political party, gender, race, or class.

All that fighting and blaming on cable news, Twitter accounts, kitchen tables, school rooms, and everywhere else in consumer-obsessed America only uses up the dwindling air in our failing space colony even faster.

All the while, it's all of our lifestyles and culture that are to blame. And like biologists say about any other lifeform, to stay on Earth, a lifeform either adapts or dies. Since we're blaming each other and not adapting our lifestyle, we're slowly dying.

My elementary class could design whatever space station and lifestyle we wanted. And we still failed.

Our problem wasn't "the other"; it was the consumer philosophy we inherited from the boomers. Philosophy is the all-powerful–but usually unspoken–force that defines our society and ourselves even more than the desire to live and breathe.

No animal can choose to evolve a new adaption. Every animal is born with specific abilities, and if those abilities can harvest resources in their environment, the animal lives. If the environment requires other skills, the animal dies. Evolution only wants the fittest to survive. 

Boomers prevented our evolution to keep their youth alive, so today, we're lifeforms unfit for our environment. But we can harness evolution consciously. We can assess our environment and decide to drop old abilities and develop the ones we need to prosper.

Today you, I, and everyone in this society can create whatever human colony we want. We can fix our problems from big to small with technological solutions.

We've already most of the new technology needed to improve our space station, but that's not enough. We must also evolve our lifestyle with a new philosophy to teach us a new lifestyle and philosophy.

New philosophies are usually written as a country dies, a sort of wish list of things that could have changed the fate of those suffering through wars, depressions, and other terrible things that happen in collapsing civilizations. The space station's descendants read this new philosophy from the ashes as they rebuild and try to learn from the past. Sadly, the writers who inspired the new countries created by the American and French Revolutions never got to live in the better world they envisioned.

Changing a society's philosophy is very hard. It never happens proactively. Instead, philosophies only change after violent revolutions. Instead of failure being our lesson, we can replace our society's philosophy proactively by changing our consumer mindset today.

Let's take a look at the future you, a person who isn't obsessed with boomer politics and who doesn't suffocate their space station with consumer toys but lives and breathes a new, practical, and problem-solving philosophy.

This new philosophy gives you the freedom of mind to mix and match ideologies as needed to overcome any political or economic problem you face. Be it a dreadful morning commute, climate change, or government red tape.

This new philosophy might be called mixed ideological politics; here's what that means.

The Universe is magnificent. It is filled with stars, nebulas, galaxies, and new wonders that never seem to stop coming. Like a good book, the Universe gets more exciting the more you look into it. 

The Universe--if it had a mind--is also a murderer. Everything about it is hostile to life. So our precious Earth is a space station flying through an empty, dark, and life-hating environment. We control very little on this station. The Earth's rotation, the Sun's brightness, the Moon's orbit, the laws of physics, and so much more are things we can study but never change.

On the bright side, Earth loves us. It's full of water, minerals, fossil fuels, dirt, and other resources to harness. But these supplies are limited. That's why every living thing–including us–must fight for its right to live on this space station. There's always a more efficient and better-evolved lifeform ready to beat us in the game of evolution.

All life forms fight the game of life, and there is much combat to stay alive. Polar bears fight for territory and mates. Fish fight over the best reefs. Insects, bacteria, fungi, everything battles. And, of course, humans fight too.

But we're naturally not good at fighting because we're so adaptable. Most species' physiology gives them limited options. For example, giraffes fight using their long necks and huge legs because that's what they got. Lions have sharp claws, prominent fangs, and massive paws, which are their weapons. Bees can only use their stinger to cause any damage to their enemies.

But with our adaptive bodies, humans are spoiled for choices; we can kick, throw, choke, pinch, bite, climb, punch, run away, and so many other things. With our high adaptability, there's no obvious way for humans to fight. This freedom enables us to invent and use remarkable technologies but also requires us to create fighting systems to defend ourselves. We call these fighting systems martial arts.

[dolts punching the air]
[Without martial arts training, we're clueless about hand-to-hand combat].

A few of our martial arts are Thai kickboxing, which is noted for its excellent kicking techniques. Wrestling is famous for manhandling opponents. Boxing teaches powerful punching combinations. Submissions are the realm of jiu-jitsu, while throws are the discipline of judo. Aikido, karate, Tae kwon do, and Krav Maga are popular too. 

Each martial art banned most fighting techniques to specialize in a few. For example, there are no chokeholds in boxing or punching in wrestling. If a competitor does outside methods, they are automatically disqualified by a referee. Each martial art removes choices to help students master a specific fighting style.

(note, that's what today's political commentators are, referring to their ideology, they're not as.)

For hundreds of years, each martial art evolved independently. Each fighting style surrounded itself with books, teachers, schools, judges, referees, competitions, and awards, all of which created an official rule book and culture. For example, karate has dojos and black belts, boxing has boxing gyms and world champions, and wrestling has college scholarships and Olympic medals. Many times, a martial art even got intertwined into a country's culture. Japan, Korea, Thailand, America, Brazil, and most other countries have their favorite form of hand-to-hand combat.

As a result of their cultural and national isolation, there was very little cross-pollination of techniques between fighting styles. Boxers never learned how to wrestle, and wrestlers never learned to throw a punch. Each martial art was like a church, with believers only attending services for their chosen craft.

However, things changed as globalization spread people, culture, and technology worldwide. A world connected by cable and satellite television lets anyone peek into any martial art. Even more critical, instructional videos taught techniques that only a live instructor once could.

With more accessible access to information, some boxers started to train submissions. Thai kickboxers learned some wrestling. Curious masters in one discipline started as eager newbies in another. Many martial artists began to follow the rules of evolution and adopted the philosophy of "adapt or die."

The world of martial arts started to get all mixed up.

Eventually, after several years of watching, learning, and generally participating in the cross-pollination of techniques between the world's martial arts, martial artists started to ask themselves, "which martial art is best?"

In the early 1990s, the questions stopped, and the fighting started. At first, called Vale Tudo, then Ultimate Fighting, master martial artists from every discipline fought in fights with no rules. Finally, the world's masters could prove their martial art was the best in the world!

And the winner of the best martial art was…

All of them are.

And none of them. 

And this surprised everyone because every discipline thought it was the best. But it was only good at its techniques. It seems obvious, but it wasn't. Every martial artist evolved inside its man-made rules. Their culture, referees, coaches, and pundits, everyone didn't care to notice Nature has no rules. The winner of a real right is the person left standing. Said another way, fights should not be judged according to who has the best techniques but who can use any method to win a battle.

Every lifeform on Earth knows this truth. No deer in the world depends on a judge to save it when fighting off a bear, as no bear depends on a judge declaring it the winner to get its next meal.

Because humans so easily fall prey to good storytelling, each martial artist was so encased into the culture of their sport they forgot real fights don't have rules. So, they'd engage in street fights without fear of their opponent's techniques.

Think of that.

Many martial artists got beaten up black and blue, knocked unconscious, or suffocated by a choke hold because human storytelling convinced them fights have rules.

For generations, even professional martial artists didn't learn from their mistakes. Martial artists were parishioners loyal to their church. When losing or winning natural rights, they'd doubled down on the belief that their chosen martial art was the only one they needed to learn. Their coaches would help them perfect their techniques but not encourage them to learn new ones.

Once martial artists opened their minds, they stopped being parishioners and started fighting for themselves. They quickly realized the rules of boxing, kickboxing, wrestling, etc., were excellent for honing their techniques but were also artificial and must be forgotten when preparing for an actual fight.

Once the martial arts community learned to "adapt or die," they eventually became "faceless"; they stopped acting how they wanted and evolved what they needed. Instead of falling prey to their martial arts culture, history, and storytelling of being the best, martial artists slowly embraced evolution as their best instructor. Training all disciplines teaches these new martial artists to thwart any attack and threaten an adversary when an opportunity arises.

Once martial artists adopted the rules of evolution, they entered a brave new world. 

A world of remarkable progress. With an open mind, fighters improved themselves by leaps and bounds every year. Boxers became wrestlers, and Jiu-jitsu black belts learned body throws. The individual disciplines brought their techniques to an open marketplace of ideas. Real fights were experiments to highlight the best fighting adaptions and weed out the bad ones in a process similar to the scientific method.

With evolution as their ultimate teacher, these new martial artists started to listen to their bodies to tell them which techniques were best. The faster the victories, and the less pain suffered in winning them, was the best judge, teacher, and pundit of fighting philosophies. The best martial arts trainers were the ones who helped their students adapt faster.

This new open-minded fighting philosophy was so successful it created a new way for humans to train and combat called mixed martial arts.

In mixed martial arts, fighters don't limit themselves within the confines of an artificial rulebook. Anyone with an open mind can learn a little from every discipline. The best technique is whatever works to win a fight.

Mixing the human body's adaptability with a free mind created a new, self-correcting, and sustainable martial art. Since mixed martial arts includes all techniques, any person, whether short or tall, chubby or skinny, aggressive or meek, can find their niche and learn to win a fight.

And finding a niche is what evolution is all about.

This birth of mixed martial arts is a fantastic story that you can watch the results in the Ultimate Fighting Championships, Bellator, Professional Fight League, and ONE Fighting Championships. Any fighter in these organizations will defeat even the best master of any discipline.

We achieved all this progress in one generation. And it's all because mixed martial arts define success based on results and not loyalty to man-made rules.

But this progress shouldn't be taken for granted.

As one astronomer says, "The Universe is under no obligation to make sense to us." This saying is true, but in many areas, humans have a horrible habit of thinking we don't need to probe, analyze, and adapt to Nature. Instead, we create stories and rules and, like a devoted Aikido practitioner fighting a mixed martial artist, assume the Universe will change because we told ourselves it should.

[Aikido vs. MMA.]

Getting out of our heads is a recurring source of progress for humanity. Man-made stories are a great source of inspiration but not truth. That's why a free mind is the starting point for our best advancements in engineering, medicine, physics, chemistry, biology, technology, and martial arts. Sadly, politics isn't yet on the list. It's easy for us to be tricked into believing stories about an ideology being the best in the world before we've even observed real-world results.

Mixed martial artists help us combat that awful habit when learning the best combat techniques. When learning the best political techniques, mixed ideological politics will help us fight ideological storytellers.

And now we return to our spaceship. Earth is still traveling through a hostile Universe with dwindling resources. Even though this planet will keep revolving around the Sun for billions of more years, which doesn't mean we'll be on it.

We have to earn that privilege by creating a sustainable colony. And given that our consumer ideologies teach our offspring to suffocate ourselves rather than live more efficiently, our prospects of having a long and prosperous career on Earth aren't optimal.

Only when we use mixed ideological politics will we have the free mind to pick ideologies based on their results instead of their stories. Only then will our space station continually adapt and, therefore, (hopefully) never die.

To practice mixed ideological politics today, you must realize you're a lifeform fighting to earn your place in a space colony. A scientist always wants to run a better experiment. A mixed martial artist always wants a more effective combat technique. These professions follow the rules of evolution. It would be best if you're politics always wanted a more efficient way of life because that is what life needs to prosper on this planet.

Defining an efficient way of life requires some work. Like the space station exercise tried to teach my class, human beings need a mix of necessities and luxuries. Mixed ideological politics empowers us to find the right balance by valuing real-world results and not storytelling. 

Better politics requires we keep all the pundits, referees, teachers, and ideologues selling their discipline at arm's length. Today's ideologues are like old-school karate or boxing teachers, someone who knows their techniques very well, but not someone who doesn't accept their ideology is limited.

Let's demonstrate this limitation using one common ideological hot topic; is there a "pay gap" because females are paid less for the same work?

Ideologues talk about this question daily (and charge you for it). But do they run any experiments? Do they ask you about your specific situation? Most workplaces forbid co-workers from sharing their salaries. So, how are ideologues in books, television, and social media so adamant there is a clear answer relevant to you?

Instead of a scientific answer, ideologues are like Aikido martial arts teachers selling a one size fits all solution. One side says yes, there is a pay gap throughout society, and the other side will say no, there isn't. Both sides are arguing half-truths because no one is talking about real people.

That's like a fighter being told boxing is relevant to their fight before the opponent is even known. Your life is unique. And if you want to discover the answer pertinent to you, you must find out what your co-workers and colleagues earn to know the answer. If you don't, you're like a scientist who never tests their theories or a martial artist who never gets into a real fight, someone who is stuck living in their head.

It would be best if you used ideologies to ask questions. Ideologies can raise important questions, like how fighting disciplines help us train specific techniques. The Feminist ideology presents lots of good questions and solutions, but it's up to you to uncover if their methods matter in your life.

Because your life has thousands of problems, you must prioritize what to train. And the best answer to your particular problem is like finding the best fighting technique; it could be found in any ideology, as long as it shows real-world progress to help you live a better life.

With all this in mind, let's use mixed ideological politics to re-frame today's political media. All the pundits, columnists, professors, hosts, and authors who sell their ideology are not good or evil, but they're limited to the stories they've created. They generalize all Americans' lives to fit their discipline. Their solution to every fight is the few techniques and public policies their ideology specializes in.

So, if you're a female earning less than your male co-workers, maybe you should fight for your rights, as a feminist might say. But it's just as likely that everyone needs a raise because all your co-workers are struggling. So perhaps it's better to band together and find ways to increase everyone's pay.

Or maybe your pay is as good as it's realistically going to be, and your energies are best spent elsewhere—better spending habits, more time with your kids. Your list of problems is long; the list of ideological options to solve them should be long too.

With mixed ideological politics, you're free to pick and choose the good from each of today's ideologies and concentrate on improving your long list of problems. Your fight shouldn't be picking and defending a doctrine but keeping your space station healthy by evolving a more affordable, profitable, and sustainable lifestyle.

Sadly, practicing mixed ideological politics can be challenging.

Ideologues tell great stories. Except they don't want you to read their stories, they want you to live them. To practice mixed ideological politics, you'll need to avoid being sucked into the fascinating stories ideologues tell. Before you can pick and choose better politics and policies from any ideology, we need to protect you from ideological storytelling.

It sounds dramatic because it is literary. To free you from ideologies, you'll learn everything about storytelling. Afterward, you'll be as powerful in your politics as a mixed martial artist in a street fight.
