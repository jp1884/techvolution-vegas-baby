# The Theory of Everything

If you're talking politics with a person you've already lost. Politics isn't about arguments or people. Politics is about who, or it's better to say what, can provide shelter, food, and water.

Can you eat debate? Can you drink philosophy? Does any lifeform debate who gets to eat or procreate?

Only in the Pixar movies we love to watch. But these tales only showcase how little we really understand about politics and our Nature.

There are debates in Nature and there are no debates in true politics.

What people think today is politics is--the fighting, arguing, writing--is a proxy argument over resources; and especially control over the technology that humans use to harvests resources. Like all lifeforms Nature demands we maximize how efficiently we harvest our resources.

But we don't evolve our biology. We don't evolve thicker fur, or grow a longer tail. No. We can only improve how we harvest resources by changing how our technology harvest resources.

Thus we don't biologically evolve; we technological evolve and this is a process I call techvolution.

Like with our Pixar movies we today humanize technological development. We think we're the main characters of the story behind techvolution. But we're not. By finally understanding techvolution we uncover the true nature of politics.

And like how Charles Darwin's "On the Origin of Species" uncovered the rules by which Nature selects biological winners, this book will teach you the rules by which Nature picks technological winners in the never-ending story of Life's ceaseless mission to harvest resources to grow, expand, and prosper.

- Understanding animal behavior and existence before evolution sucked. It was filled with bs. Understanding human behavior before techvolution also sucks.

The tax rate where I'm physically standing is 45%. The tax-rate in Singapore is 25%. I decided to pay my taxes to Singapore and save myself 20%. I shouldn't expect any problems.

If that makes sense to you, that a person and pick and choose where to pay their taxes, then status of our politics and economics will in general make sense to you. This book will explain them both in great detail but you'll be able to follow along pretty easily.

If you think I would have problems selectively choosing where to pay my taxes

- Every true political thought, debates, arguments, should happen standing next to a hungry child. A community responding to real-life immediate physical pain of its members is the point of politics.
- Are there aliens? Was the British Empire over zealous spreading modernity? Maybe, but those aren't political topics because neither is about an immediate problem. Nor are they addressable either...
  
- growth/centralization ---> adaption/decentralization ---> growth/centralization ---> adaption/decentralization ---> growth/centralization and so on in circle.
- A cyclical relationship in biological and technological actualization. Evolution and techvolution. Growth is the start of an age, where new lifeforms spread as far and wide as possible looking to set-up roots. Adaption happens after all the space is filled, and the established lifeforms adaption uniqueness in mostly closed ecosystems. See: anamorphosis.

- We anthropomorphize civilization. Like bad storytellers who think the character is more important than the plot; we by default think civilization is about our biology. It's about the technology we event (inside micro-stories) inside life's/God's never ending story to defeat the ultimate villain called Darth Entropy and colonize this Universe.

- Juxtapose the techvolution of tractors from 1945, 1980, 2000, and 2020 against the stagnation of computer work in most industries. The difference is farmers must, and are allowed to, specialize in the tools of their craft and thus have incentive to evolve. Hence why food got so much more plentiful while...
