Please watch this clip. I'll make a point afterward.

This book deals with topics of violent wars, civil-wars, and revolutions. I don't mean to scare or frighten you. But, just like pandemics, these horrible events happen in societies, and they'll happen again.

I'll prove it with a small thought experiment.

Take wherever you're reading this; be it Toronto or Miami. If you go back in time, you, your exact person, would be subject to the dominant or ruling philosophy of the time.

Let's use New York City, for example.

If you'd lived there in 1600, your personal politics would very likely be devoted to a European Royal. You'd be absolutely sure He, or She, was Divine and sent from God to rule over society with absolute power. Your economics would be Mercantilism. Which would mean your daily job would somehow help send the New World's bountiful resources to the home country so they could use it to manufacture goods for you to buy.

Unless you were black or a Native American. Then you'd be totally excluded from, and likely oppressed by, European society.

But on the bright side, when you fast forward two hundred years, New York would be about to abolish slavery. On top of that, you'd think Kings and Queens are tyrants. Your daily job would be connected to capitalism in some way, where you'd be (somewhat) free to try and make it rich.

Fast forward 200 years again, and you'd get you.

Of course, in between, you'd have many wars, civil wars, and revolutions.

Because each jump through history means society is evolving with better technology, and new philosophies to run our economics and politics. And human evolution is bumpy.

That leads me to my point. If you're entirely devoted to Marxism, Progressivism, Conservatism, or other popular philosophies today, this book isn't for you. I want to smoothen our evolution. And while I don't think these philosophies are invalid or evil, I believe they are too old to create a healthy society.

I think our job as regular people on this Earth is to evolve. So, if you believe our evolution stops because you really like, or hate, Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump, then again, please don't read this.

This book is for the people sick of hating the _other side_ because hate leads us to all those nasty wars, civil wars, and revolutions we all never want to talk about during times of peace, yet keep recurring in our history.

And that leads us to the clip above. The one where "everyone hates everything." We hate everything today because we're living with amazingly powerful Internet Age tools. Yet we work and live inside a dated Industrial Age way of life. Our potential is wasted, and we're all increasingly frustrated for being held back.

And that "Netflix Moment," that's the realization, the "clicking" in our head, that this book wants to recreate many times as we venture to create a new philosophy for the Internet Age.

Because only when we realize our potential can we evolve our society with a better way of life.
