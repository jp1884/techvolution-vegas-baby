# CAST OF IDEAS AND CHARACTERS

## Introduction

I'm being serious, you are literally the hero of this story. The one who will change the world.

Don't worry. All heroes start as extras. Luke Skywalker worked on his farm, Neo typed at his cubicle, Cinderella cleaned the chateau. All heroes suffer under evil antagonists, until the story needed them to step up, and take charage, and win their, and everyone's, freedom.

Before we change the world, I want to layout cast and ideas clearly, so you know what's ahead. Here's what we need to know:

Philosophy: the largley unspoken ideals that tells members of society what's right and wrong, good and bad, in science, art, morals, politics and economics. Used to make rules around questions like: what is scientific truth? Who should govern? How should resources be organized?

Ruling philospophy: is a civilization's chosen philosophy. One that all factions agree on. Like the "Divine Rights of Kings" derived from Christian theology used in royalist Europe, "Marxist-Leninism" of the Soviet Union, or the combination of "red vs blue" of our political and economic philosophy today.

Technology: a catchall term for things we make tools from, like concrete, lumber, nails, shingles, insulation, and bricks.

Tool: a catchall term for things we create with technology to solve a problem, like guns to kill bad guys, books to learn, and houses to shelter in.

Frontline: The place of contact between a tool and the problem. A movie usher talking to moviegoers, nurses talking to patients, cleaners cleaning a bus, police chasing a robber, soldiers on the battlefield.

Hierarchy: Every tool develops a power structure. We usually reward those who rise in it with more power and prestige. Feudalism castles and their rigid hierarchy of nobles, church, knights, merchants and peasants is easiest example.

Civilization story: The invention of new technology and creation of new tools to overcome whatever problem troubles us. We use tools to evolve.

Protagonists: people who selflessly invent, spread, and use new technology and new tools. Usually close to the problems on the frontline, they individually struggle, but their continued self-sacrifice slowly improves life on Earth. We call their leaders trailblazers who often skirt the rules like Nikola Tesla, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk.

Antagonists: people who selfishly resist new tools to defend their wealth, power, and prestige. Often called established, or elites, antagonists usually manage companies or institutions based on dated technologies and think working on the frontline is beneath them. They hide behind rules, which they work to control. We don't often individually identify them. I invented "Darth Blockbuster" so we can.

Extras: everybody in the middle of a battle between two tools. Because they have no direct interest in either side, they can pick winners and losers. Usually extras are in the middle class; not so poor as to be desperate, but not so powerful they want to keep the world the same. Sadly, extras don't realize their power.

Techvolution: a new philosophy empowering seemless human technological evolution by ridding Darth Blockbuster of his power, by empowering extras to decide when society should upgrade our tools.

So that's what you need to know. Here's how we fight with it.
