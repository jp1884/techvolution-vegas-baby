# The Damaged World

## Introduction

There is a destination to your training. This world is hurting. Like the stories in Star Wars, The Matrix, Cinderella, there is something rotten in the state of our world.

We don't master our politics. We fight political battles out of habit. We spend billions on education programs, and argue who should pay. Yet we live in a world of free education, that's deprived of prestige and resources in order to keep the Darth Blockbuster's kindergarden to university system fed.

One small example in a world of no techvolution. Here's the consequence.

## Happy

Are you happy? It's an important question. Like Sophia teaching Douglass to read, it's supposed to feel good living inside a ruling philosophy. After she was clicked by the ruling philsophy, Sophia turned wicked to others, but herself was miserable.

So are you happy? I'm not asking in a small way. I'm asking in a big way. Is your life, happy? Do you spend lots of time with friends and family. Are you debt free. Can you quit your job. Does your work give you dignity. Have you experienced love. Is your livelihood secure. Do you raise your children. Are you following your passion. Would you watch your life if it was on Netflix. Whatever it means to you, do you happily live your life?

If a ruling philosophy is a good story, you should see the reason for being a character inside it. So let's re-ask the question of your happiness this way. If you think of your relationship with society now; things like the cost of food, shelter, and transportation, how much your vote matters, when you see your friends, what your boss gets paid, how we care for the environment, are you really chained to your desk. These things, and others, are our way of life. Are you happy with the connection between you and your ruling philosophy?

You should be asking this, because the nobility is happy with the ruling philosophy, and thinks your happy too. They actually take it for granted. But I doubt you've really asked yourself, "am I happy?". You assume the ruling philosophy is good, because it makes the rules. But your happiness should rule you. Like in every relationship, happiness is a two way street.

## The Situation

Being unhappy is a good sign of bad times. Heck, our ancestors during the Great Depression and World War II were happier than we are today. Extras were struggling, but society was still operating better than ours, because the ruling philosophy was more in tune with the technological times. Politics compromised more. Corporations felt civic responsibility. Individuals trusted government and each other more.

The internet, transitor, personal computer, all stated to be invented in the late 1950's, early 1960's....
