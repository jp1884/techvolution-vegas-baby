# PROLOGUE

## Dedication

For the open source community. For the unspoken philosophy you handed down to me. For caring so much when updating Wikipedia, writing free software, and building cool new tech for us all. For showing me who the protagonists are. Itâ€™s the best education a political guy can get. I hope I learned enough.

For the antagonists, the self-entitled delegators keeping Blockbuster alive, thanks for making the past come to life. I hope you learn something.

To the extras. I pray you pick the right side.

## The Start

It all started with a door in the face. I few more actually. I'm either too stubborn or too hopeful. Either way, I eventually learned my lesson. I was selling a product they were never going to buy.

Before you wonder, it wasn't the price, there was no price. It wasn't the competition. None of that either. And I can promise it worked, because I had done the frontline job it worked for.

I figured out how to solve a problem, and save 100 million dollars, 300,000 hours of productivity, and even several lives, with an app that was virtually free. All I wanted was to give it away. I wrote (another) book about the untapped possibilities of new tech like apps, bio-monitors, and bitcoin. I wanted real-world proof, and maybe get some real-world credentials, to help validate my ideas.

But I was a fool. I wasn't even knocking on doors. I was knocking on gates. See, I wasn't talking to the frontline workers suffering through the problem I solved, but bureaucrats, lawyers, managers, and executives, who were paid to deal with problems. Actually solving anything was asking them to fire themselves. Hence the gates they kept closed to new tools.

That's why they never said no to me. No needs a reason. Instead they said it was against the rules to say yes. Obscure ones hidden inside regulations and contracts. They believed in these rules, especially the one against letting frontline workers decide for themselves.

I'm not going to talk about my experience too much. All that's important is there was a problem, a big one wasting millions of your dollars, weeks of workers time (lots of it unpaid overtime), and maybe even your life, and it was against the rules to solve it.

## The Power Of Stories

Do you love stories? I think it's a safe bet. Who doesn't? They entertain us after hard days of work, bring us together to share our joys, and my favroite, open our minds to the different rules and philosophies of foreign cities, mythical worlds, and galaxies far far away.

Stories are so powerful because they're so simple. Protagonists are good because they want to fix a problem. Antagonists are bad because they don't. Stories aren't debates. We take the protagonists side. Thus, Romeo and Juliet's love is beautiful and worth dying for, while their familes feud is ignorant and stupid. Luke Skywalker's rebellion is good and worth fighting for, while Darth Vader's empire is wicked and deserves to die.

Moral clarity about a problem turns protagonists into our heroes, and antagonists into our villians. We thus watch their story with strong emotions, which burst out at the climax, where we find out who wins.

Our hero fights hard to defeat the stories problem, but his superior morality, justice, and heroism isn't enough. He's often too weak or unskilled, and the villian beats him bloody. On the verge of failure, the hero needs to find something, something that'll turn the tide. He searches, sees, and reaches for his salvation; a sword, gun, or lightsaber.

Will our hero reach it, or will our enemy? We in the audience, like extras in the story, hold our breadth because the story's society is controlled not by desires, opinions, or rules, but by which character holds the tools. It's a lesson we need to learn for ourselves.

## A New Empowering Philosophy Called Techvolution

The rules. We think they control us. They don't. I'll show you.

Talk to any political junkie, no matter when, and they'll say there's a big election coming up. They'll say something like "if the red team wins this one, education, healthcare, infrastructure, everything will go to shit." What he means is elections decide the rule makers, and blue rules are good, red rules are evil.

If you buy it, most of us have at some time, you watch blue cable news, read blue blogs, listen to blue talk radio. You fill your head with blue's philosophy. Soon enough, your face is painted blue, your waving a blue bristol board while yelling blue chants at rallies, marches, and protests. You feel like a hero! You're fighting evil red philosophy!

Let me ask you, if your a regular middle class person, and you ignored the election, how much would you bet, that you would know who won, just by living your life.

I mean today, when team blue wins, does traffic suddenly disappear? When team red wins, does everyone suddenly eat healthy? Do you breath fresher air, or see healthier neighbors, i.e. do your real life problems get solved, when one color's philosophy writes the rules?

If you think yes, if you think the red vs blue story is an edge of your seat thriller deciding the future of our society, you can stop reading. There's lots of blogs, shows, and books waiting to sing to their choir, telling you to fight the enemy until your blue in the face.

If you don't like the choir, or you're starting to wonder if blaming the other color is a convenient excuse for both red and blue to distract from middle class stagnation, you'll probably like to keep reading. I wrote this book for you.

Whichever color wins an election today and writes the rules, regular people still pay taxes, have a mortage, drive in traffic, don't sleep enough, buy unhealthy food, watch climate change, over pay for questionable education, can't understand their health insurance, get abused by unhappy customers, work unpaid overtime, don't know their health records, are micro-managed, and hope a job we likely hate isn't downsized or outsourced.

Under blue or red rules, our lifestyle stays the same, because the tools in which we live our lives, stay the same. Blue and red rules promote a suburban, 9-5, way of life. That means single detached homes homes, gas cars, call centres, paper based tax forms, mass produced unhealthy food, television for entertainment, an increasing education industry, and everything else in suburban America and Canada sprawl.

Neither red and blue can improve middle class lives, because their philosophies, from conservatism to progressivism, capitalism to marxism, does not put new tools into our hands.

It's not their fault. All of them were invented before we had many tools. Horse and carriages, ships pushed by wind, the moon as a nightlite, were common tools when red and blue were born. Think of it, their philosophical fathers like Adam Smith, Edmund Burke, John Stuart Mill, Karl Marx, never turned on a light-bulb, watched a movie, wore rubber shoes, touched plastic, flew in a plane, drove a car, made a phone call, opened a fridge, took a picture, used penicillin, had an x-ray, started a motor, or listened to the radio.

Red and blue philosphies were invented to group society into a massive collection action. With red and blue philosophies we came together, industrialized, and built the first rudimentary tools like toilets, gas cars, black and white televisions, and computers the size of rooms. The masses needed to be extras, regulated and managed inside massive color coded parties because our tools were few, and couldn't be shared with everyone. To their credit, blue and red philosophies at least gave extras a voice in how our tools factories, regulations, and profits, were controlled. Even if the voice was one among many in protests and rallies.

Yet today with live in a world far far away from limited tools. Digital tools are so easy to make we can customize them for every person's individual problems. Netflix, Lyft, Skype, WhatsApp, 3D printing, bio-monitors, air quality sensors, GPS trackers, Kickstarter, YouTube, Khan Academy, smart watches, GitHub, AirBnB, or Firefox are amazingly powerful new tools that are so easy to make, we don't need to fight to control them, but fight to spread and teach them.

Techvolution is a new philosphy about making regular people the hero of their own story. By empowering them with new tools.

With Techvolution, you wont fight political battles with bristol boards or painted faces. You'll economically exercise your right to vote, by deciding which tools best solve your problem at home and work. Unlike me, you'll never see any gatekeepers, because you won't have to knock at anyone's door asking permission to do what's best for you.

I'm not talking about an idealic world from storytime. This place of sharing tools already exists. Wikipedia, YouTube, StackOverflow, GitHub, Linux, Mozilla are only a few examples of the wonderful world of cooperation today called the open-source community. It's a place where even for profit companies are realie the power of sharing to help create new tools. Millions of creators and contributors, designers and coders, are already working and living inside a fundamentally new story that's responsible for our online world. I only want to rid our society of old philosophies holding it back, to let these protagonists prosper.

People often say we're addicted to our phones. We aren't. We getting to know them. They are lightsabres set to destroy the gatekeepers of old philosophies. We've just been waiting for a new philosophy to turn them on. That's techvolution.
