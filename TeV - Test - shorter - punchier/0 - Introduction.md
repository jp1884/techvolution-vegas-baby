# INTRODUCTION

I want to empower you with tools. Yet, this is not a book about how to invent tools. Amazing books like _Rework_, and _Zero to One_ already do that. Nor is it a book about the history of invention. _The Innovators_ does that better than I could dream. If you want brilliant critiques of our society, _The Incerto_ and _The Great Degeneration_ are already waiting for you. Instead, this is a book about how new tools empower society, and how we can distribute their power to improve the lives of regular people today.

That means changing the rules of our society with a new philosophy. Todays philosophies don't mix well with modern technology. They consider the middle class as extras. People to watch the story. Even if we watch our problems pile up at home and at work, we're not supposed to solve them until we pass the gatekeepers of old tools in government bureaucracies, creeky corporations, lawyers officers, or consultant meetings. All versions of Blockbuster writing rules to protect themselves in an era of YouTube and Netflix.

We start our new philosophy in nature. Notice gatekeeper's don't exist there. Evolution doesn't have anyone telling a cheetah she's running too fast, that the ants are too cooperative, or a camel is too water efficient. Lifeforms adapt as best they can to their own problems and the winners survive. No middleman, no gatekeepers, just problem solvers.

Human biological adaptions have stopped. We'll never evolve to fly, do advanced calculations, or breath Martian air. Humanity continues lifes evolution with tools. We're basically cyborgs who adapt and solve problems by upgrading our tools to the lastest problem in transportation, calculation, and breathing. Hold a hammer, gun, or calculator and you're a different cyborg each time.

However, our problem solving is held back by old philosophies that empower gatekeepers. People in control of old tools like Blockbuster, getting to decide when, and if, humanity will upgrade our tools. I actually don't like the term gatekeepers. Some gates are good. I use a different term.

In _Star Wars_, the Force is an all powerful energy field. The Jedi like Luke Skywalker, harness the light side of the force to help others, while the evil Sith like Darth Vader harness the dark side to help themselves.

Tools empower humanity. We already call technological protagonsts "trailblazers" who invent new tools for us cyborgs to hold.  But we don't have a term for the antagonists. Thus, I call antagonists to our technological evolution Darth Blockbuster. Assholes who prevent human evolution for their self-interest.

We call biological upgrades and adaptions evolution. I call human technological evolution _Techvolution_. This book is about inventing techvolution, a philosophy to re-write the rules of society, to forever kill Darth Blockbuster, so regular people can solve our problems with technological upgrades as smoothly in human society, as evolution does in nature.
