# THE OPENING BATTLE

## Introduction

All stories start with an opening battle. It helps the audience understand the story'e problem, and meet the good and bad guys fighting over it. For us, the problem is the invention of new technology, and creation of new tools. So, let's see how the a battle looks like.

## New Tools Start The Fight

So humanity evolves with tools. Some people help, others hurt.

Upgrading a technology isn't a big deal. Sedan's and SUV's, tube televisons's and LCD's, are basically the same. But when we upgrade enough technologies, like microchips, touchscreens, batteries, and WiFi, we unlock a new tool, ala smartphones. And this is a big deal.

Because creating a new tool asks a climactic and political question, who controls it? After all, whoever does, is more powerful. Thus, while civilization is a struggle to overcome problems by upgrading technology and inventing new tools, it's also a battle to control them. The people with the old tool usually want to retain their power, while inventors and innovators imagine a new society that shares it.

The eternal story of civilization is thus protagonists making new tools, antagonists attacking new tools, and many extras watching them fight. Our politics is an ongoing history of technological change, with inventor and gatekeeper both reaching for the tool to make themselves the winner.

Today the extras are not self-aware of their power to decide the winner. I'll show you how important you are. Here's how you changed the world just by being curious.

## Extras Killed Wikipedia's Evil Twin

People always have some nagging question. Like why are movie theatres so expensive, or is a candy apple a real apple. Constant questions are a problem and we need a reference tool to solve it. True to ourselves, we make one with the technology available and upgrade it when possible.

Our first reference tools was the wisdom of elders. The first technological upgrades were papyrus scrolls and ink (500 BC) and books (500), which turned elders into experts like Hippocrates and Aristotle. When wood-pulp paper (1200) and printing press (1456) were invented, humanity unlocked mass produced books. Now experts could share knowledge between themselves, and educate the masses. We called the reference books encyclopedias.

People loved encyclopedia's. For the first time many answers were available on demand. The Encyclopedia Britannica (1878) was the standard. It went into continuous publication (1933) to keep people updated to the latest facts. In the following decades, the computer, digital printer, and telecommunications meant encyclopedia's were written and stored digitally. But they stayed a set of books controlled by experts.

Then came the world wide web (1991), a new technology that unlocked many new tools like websites, forums, blogs, and something called "wikis". Wiki software lets anyone write or edit a webpage by pressing "edit now". All changes are saved, so anyone can erase errors or vandalism by pressing "undo now". For years programmers used wikis to collaboratively write technical manuals.

As web tools boomed in the late '90's, protagoinst Jimmy Wales wondered if the web could upgrade encyclopedias. Most of us curious about things like candy apples know the story ends with a free online encyclopedia anyone can edit called Wikipedia. But it didn't start out that way.

Wikipedia started as Nupedia (2000). Nupedia was a free online copycat of Encyclopedia Britannica where only “expert” professors made articles. Wikipedia (2001) was a side project. Only programmers knew "community content creation" would work.

Everyone else assumed regular people would only read professors. The first issue was the professors didn't like to share. In its first year Nupedia had 12 articles. Wikipedia had 40,000, which most professors loved to belittle as rubbish and disallowed students from referencing. Yet professors refused to improve, or assigned students to improve, Wikipedia.

The second issue was it turned out "expert" answers, and answers, are the same. Candy apples are real apples popular in autumn festivals no matter who says it. And thirdly, most importantly, Wikipedia turned many extras into protagonists! A huge community of non-academics voluntarily shared their knowledge one "edit now" at a time and fiercely protected their common knowledge with "undo now".

And lastly, so many of the remaining extra's flocked to Wikipedia. The extras mass support quickly made Wikipedia king, while giving Nupedia and Encyclopedia Britannica quick deaths.

That's the story Wikipedia. Made by new protagoinsts, made the standard reference tool by empowered extras. Few believed it was possible, because even professors don't understand new tools always unpower the few, to empower the rest. Interestingly, after I finally conceded temporary defeat to Darth Blockbuster, I uploaded a few pages to Wikipedia instead. Not as helpful as my app, but it took a few weeks of work, and one "edit now" button, to make it real.

## What Happens Next

Fighting to spread the power of new tools is an archetypal human story. Galileo fought a religious establisment with a telescope, George Washington fought a political establishment with a musket, and Steve Jobs fought a economic establishment with an iPod.

And that's the story I want to empower all the extras to join with lightsaber's a blazin', dicing up old tools like the evil storm stroopers they are, to smooth out humanity's natural evolution. It's vital to realize the story is about problems and tools, not people. So while professors were antagonists to a better reference tool, many of Wikipedia's facts were discovered by professors, so they're hardly pure villians.

Our lives cut across thousands to millions of problems. Thus, our villians are not in a massive group like "the rich" or the "the unions" as old philosophies label. Instead we have "micro-villians" inside thousands of companies, institutions, and organizations, withholding new tools, so they can keep their version of the DVD alive.

While, I'll show the Jedi in the open-source community how to fight Darth Blockbuster better, my audience is the extras. They are the power brokers in our society. They should understand the apps they use, the tools they fund, the rules they follow, drive our society's future more than any political election ever will.

The extras can kill Darth Blockbuster. I know this because our battle today was fought generations ago with his master, Darth King.

Darth King lived inside palaces, using society's money to host splendid banquests and balls. His absolute power hidden inside a ruling philosophy of the "noble's divine right to rule". Slowly, as protagonists invented scientific instruments, books, and guns, a new philosophy was born. A philosophy of science, enlightenment, equality, and democracy made real when the protagonists and extras fought as one in the American and French Revolutions. These revolutions are our guide to kill not just Darth Blockbuster, but the Sith for good. They were inspired by the new philosophy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau.
