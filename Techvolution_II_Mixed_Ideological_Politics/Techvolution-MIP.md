## Book II: Mixed Ideological Politics

## Back Page Summary

Even before the covid pandemic, middle-class Americans and Canadians had serious problems: rising debt, stagnating wages, expensive healthcare. Not too long ago, we could relax and assume our political culture would solve our everyday headaches. Not anymore. Today, politics on both sides of the border is controlled by ideologically obsessed reporters, columnists, and pundits creating new ways to sell to their Left-wing or Right-wing choirs.

The pandemic made middle-class problems worse, making traditional Left/Right politics even more dysfunctional.

In _A New Identity_ we helped people realize our technological nature. In _Mixed Ideological Politics_, we'll see what we can do with our new awareness.

We can see how Main Street has a big choice to make. To improve our lives we can either pick a side in the increasingly nasty Left/Right war. Or, we can start funding, buying, and using new interoperable products, apps, and electronics that we custom-design to solve our everyday problems in what we call Bumblebee Economics.

But before the middle-class can choose the better option and reach for the incredible power of modern technology, we need to redefine what's good and bad in our politics. To do that, we must adopt a new political philosophy for people in the moderate middle.

Here it is.

## Series of Works

_Techvolution: On the Origin of Technological Species_ presents a new way of understanding human civilization. It showcases how the human story is driven not by our beliefs or ideologies, but by the technologies we create and use. In a series of books, we explore how becoming self-aware of our technological nature transforms three interconnected realms: individual identity, political discourse, and economic systems.

**Book I—A New Identity:** This foundational work introduces a "technological identity"—the idea that we humans are best understood through the tools and technologies we use to house ourselves, earn a living, and in general, interact with the world. While we have names for our nationality, ethnicity, employment, and politics, we lack consciousness of our technological nature.

Consider someone labeled "Californian, female, Hispanic, college graduate, progressive, regional manager"—yet none of these captures what matters most to her: it is 2011, high-speed internet is finally widespread, and she sells DVDs for a living. Because technological evolution is about to make physical media discs obsolete, her personal networks and knowledge base are now of questionable value. Yet, we have no name for this identity that might upend her life. This is but one example of why, from power tools to smartphones, our technological choices not only shape what we can do but who we should see in the mirror.

**Book II—Mixed Ideological Politics:** Having established our technological identity, we must next liberate our toolsets from ideological constraints. Today, we often reject useful tools simply because of their political or cultural associations—renewable energy is labeled "green," diesel trucks "red-blooded American." These artificial divisions prevent us from combining technologies in optimal ways.

Mixed Ideological Politics teaches how to evaluate tools based purely on their effectiveness in solving our real-life problems, from the cost of home heating to increased storm activity. This new political philosophy prevents any ideology from blinding us to any worthy technology. In essence, this book is about learning political moderation in the modern age.

**Book III—Bumblebee Economics:** Once we combine technological self-awareness with ideology-free tool selection, we can create an economy as adaptive as life itself. Nature shows us the way. Her diverse biological species create collaborative ecosystems through simple rules of interaction. Bumblebee Economics applies this wisdom to our technological world. While we have already developed some open-source and interoperable technologies like USB and Bluetooth, we need an economic philosophy that accelerates their use to create a freely evolving technological ecosystem.

The goal is to create an ecosystem similar to Apple's, but more decentralized and dynamic: imagine medical records seamlessly flowing between a doctor's office, pharmacy, and your smartphone. All this via independent, yet standardized, programs that can evolve independently. Like bees and flowers co-evolving in a symbiotic relationship, this framework would enable technologies to adapt and grow, with users benefiting from increasingly capable and interconnected systems. With this approach, we can finally move on from the Industrial Age's mass-production mindset and embrace the era of mass collaboration in the Internet Age.

_“When you grow up you tend to get told the world is the way it is and … to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. That’s a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.”_

## Introduction

An important concept in both biology and technology is the idea of cohesion. Whatever adaptation life comes up with must integrate with the other players, otherwise no ecosystem can form and entropy takes a hit. Life is a team game, and player cohesion is vital to winning.

How do humans, who operate the technological ecosystem, become and stay cohesive?

With all the diversity on the game board, how can we filter so that humans will act together.

We use stories, and most of which are ideologies. Ideologies are powerful things. The are responsible for organizing groups of humans, from hundreds to this and that....

What does the term even mean?

The term "ideo" in "ideological" comes from the Greek word "idea", which means "form", "thought", or "concept". In the context of ideology, it refers to a system of ideas, beliefs, or values that shape an individual's or group's perspective on the world and guide one's thinking, behavior, or actions. An ideology is a comprehensive and coherent set of ideas that provide a framework for understanding and interpreting reality, often influencing one's attitudes, opinions, and decisions.

The term "logical" in "ideological" comes from the Greek word "logos", which means "reason", "discourse", or "study". All of which suggests a connection to the rational, systematic, and coherent organization of ideas.

In essence, the "logical" aspect of ideology implies a structured and reasoned approach to understanding and interpreting the world. It connotes a sense of intellectual coherence, consistency, and rigor in the development and application of a system of ideas.

However, it's worth noting that the term "logical" in "ideological" doesn't necessarily imply that an ideology is objectively rational or true. Rather, it suggests that an ideology is a systematic and coherent framework for understanding the world, even if its underlying assumptions or conclusions may be subjective, biased, or flawed.

In this sense, the "logical" part of the word "ideological" highlights the importance of reason, argumentation, and intellectual coherence in the development and promotion of a particular ideology.

In short ideology is self-referencing. It's ideas are logical to itself. Since humans are creatures like any other, our ideas do not control our destiny. We are subject to the game board of life and thus the rules of evolution.

But we will always tell, believe in, and need stories. It's how we make sense of the world in which we live in.

Thus, it's essential to filter out the good from the bad rules throughout our everyday lives. It takes practice, and it demands cultivating our integrity and inner truths. Yet it's a struggle that's been taking place for centuries.

As an example of how to break from ideologies, we need not look further than this story of a Maryland farm boy named Frederick, who was born approximately two centuries ago.

---

Our story is about a Maryland farm boy named Frederick using tools to overcome ignorance. His farm is one of those you might have seen on shows like _Little House on the Prairie_. Salt of the earth farmers raising crops and families in 19th century rural America. No internet, no school systems, not much to learn but how to survive with your hands and the fortune God gave you.

Frederick worked in the fields with his mother. It was hard labor, of course, there weren't many machines around, so he had to spill much blood, sweat, and tears, for himself and his mother.

In a few years, Frederick was sent to work with a relative in Baltimore. The house was large, and the young family could use help cleaning, shopping, doing chores. It made his mother happy he wouldn't sweat so much, yet Frederick was a farmer and unsure of the big city.

The patriarch of the house was named Hugh. He wasn't around much. His new wife, Sophia, was. She was a foreigner used to colder climates who didn't know many people yet, so she stayed in a lot. Sophia was kind and treated Frederick well. Not as a farmer, but as an interesting person. She made Frederick feel at ease.

One day, Sophia handed Frederick a list of items to pick up from the store. Frederick's eyes looked down, his shoulders slouched, like a dog who disappointed its masters. Frederick mumbled, "I can't read."

"My God, that won't do!" Sophia responded, then continued, "Reading is good. How else can a person give and receive information from... from... the world! I'll teach you; we'll do it together."

So, Sophia began to teach Frederick to read. Sophia was a majician every day and was overjoyed.

Frederick even more so! Finally, all those markings in the store, on street corners, in books, in newspapers, in the Holy Bible, meant something! Go left, turn right, open, closed, discounted, welcome, and Salvation, all words that open a new world!

For the first time in his life Frederick had self-respect. He felt like he was a player in the game of civilization.

Now Frederick danced to the store, and he whisked himself to do his chores. As he kept learning he loved how the world kept getting bigger, and more information kept pouring in.

One day Hugh came home early. He saw Sophia and Frederick reading at the dinner table. Hugh walked into the room. "Boy, get out, and wait in the hallway. Face the wall."

Frederick got out, went outside, and faced the wall.

Seconds turned to minutes. Frederick rolled the newspaper in his hands tighter. He didn't want to go back to the farm. But even more, he didn't want his angel to get in trouble.

Inside the room, Sophia was curious, "What is it?." Hugh responded, "This isn't Ohio... Darling, you can't do that. We could get in a lot of trouble. You can't teach them to read."

Sophia responded, "everyone learns to read in Ohio."

Hugh takes a seat and takes a deep breath to calm his nerves. Now he looks at his naive wife "This isn't a free State. He is a slave. What do you think happens when slaves read? Don't you think they'll start thinking?" Sophia's eyes went wide. Hugh continued, "It's against the rules to teach a slave to read... now teach the boy."

As Frederick hears the hallway door open, he straightens up and grips his newspaper.

Sophia says, "Turn around."

Frederick does and looks at his angel, who talked with him like he was a person. And she looked back and only saw _her boy_.

Sophia slapped the newspaper from her boy's hand. He didn't let go. She hit again and again and again. Each slap hurt more than a dozen whips on his scarred back.

She slapped, and slapped, and hit, and hit. Sophia was told her new society's ruling philosophy. The majical joy of teaching someone to read, of expanding humanity's cyborgology to better win the game of evolution, was erased.

Sophia now knows what evil is, and she will not do it. She will use the Death Star. Sophia then and there became a demon protector of vile racism to justify human slavery.

Frederick's world shut down again. The one white person ignorant enough to treat him like a person was now an educated convert to the rules that put him into chains. Physical chains if needed, but evil prefers mental chains of ignorance; they stay on so much easier.

Weeks later, Frederick was still in despair. His daily routine was the same. Yet, working under demonic masters is just different. He didn't dance to the store, he didn't whisk to do his chores, and he never saw Sophia smile again.

Demons are never happy. Demons are always on guard.

One day while doing his chores, Frederick saw a newspaper, the avenue to knowledge whose path Frederick was once on. He looked at the markings, saw some words he knew, and one word he didn't. Yet he still stared at it.

Why?

The answer slapped him harder than the demon ever did, he read the words "The Free States in the ~~North~~." He heard the word freedom before, but he didn't know freedom was a real place.

A shockwave went through him when he realized if slavery was a place, so must freedom be a place too. Frederick realized he could break chains! Because ignorance was always his demon, and knowledge was always his angel. And he fought ignorance and received wisdom, whenever he read.

So, Frederick taught himself to read.

He practiced with "ignorant" white kids on the streets. He read items tags at the grocery store and signs on the road. And he practiced every time he was at the Baltimore dock; did you hear me Stargazer, the dock I said, you know the place, where ships will take you anywhere in the world.

If you can read the schedule.

One day Sophia waited for her boy to return. But the boy died when the man Frederick Douglass walked onto the ship headed north to freedom. The man knew the exact time, place, and fare he needed to get on. He read it, himself, on the schedule.

Reading opened the world to Frederick, and now the free world was opened to him.

The story gets better. Frederick Douglass wasn't happy just reading, he became a world-famous orator and writer. His words changed the game of civilization.

In a world with no radio, video, or telephones, Douglass travels the Northern States and Europe telling everyone the truth about slavery. When the American Civil War (1861-1865) broke out, his books helped Britain reject recognizing the slave States, and thus deprived it of much-needed support.

The irony of a slave educating people about slavery, and thereby helping to end slavery, is the cherry on top of this great story.

Darth Blockbuster writes rules to keep the tools he commands, and therefore himself, in power. Bank mainframes, insurance underwriting systems, university lecture halls. These are examples of Industrial Age levers of power being guarded by the Death Star of confusing terms of service policies, elitist academic guidelines, and dense government regulations.

But how can a regular person pinpoint a rulebook as a Death Star? Darth Blockbuster doesn't tell people he's Darth Blockbuster. Instead, he says he's the prince or the executive, an earl or consultant. Are these people genuine authority figures in society, or antagonists protecting their paychecks?

It's essential to filter out the good from the bad rules throughout our everyday lives. It takes practice, and it demands cultivating our integrity and inner truths. Yet it's a struggle that's been taking place for centuries.

As an example, you needn't look further than this story of a Maryland farm boy named Frederick, who was born approximately two centuries ago.

Frederick Douglass was a true hero. His exceptional bravery, persistence, and intelligence showcase humanity's endless potential. He became a protagonist and convinced extras to become player gods and upgrade their society's ruling philosophy against vile racism. His books were levers of power that still improve the world today.

Among his many lessons Stargazer, Douglass teaches us how to use majic to tell the difference between good and evil rules.

Sophia taught Douglass to read. She wasn't told to. She did it because we all love showing our chosen tools, whether they're pen and paper, new apps, or how to tape drywall. It's as natural to spread our cyborgology, as it is for a species to propagate their biology.

When a magician makes a playing card disappear, we smile in awe and childish wonder. That's cool, but nothing new was created, so we soon lose our joy. However, when a majician connects someone with typing, drawing, or reading, they've similarly performed something awesome. They've upgraded someone's cyborgology, helped them solve problems better, and effectively created a new and improved person. This makes us smile for a long time.
