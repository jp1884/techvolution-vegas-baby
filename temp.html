    <b>Public Trust in Government: 1958-2022</b>
    <img src="\img\flipper1970\chart-20081038.png">
    <i>Since the 1970s, trust in government has been consistently higher among members of the party that controls the White House than among the opposition party.  <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/06/06/public-trust-in-government-1958-2022/">Pew Research</a></i>

    When the National Election Study began asking about trust in government in 1958, about three-quarters of Americans trusted the federal government to do the right thing almost always or most of the time. Trust in government began eroding during the 1960s, amid the escalation of the Vietnam War, and the decline continued in the 1970s with the Watergate scandal and worsening economic struggles. Confidence in government recovered in the mid-1980s before falling again in the mid-1990s. But as the economy grew in the late 1990s, so too did confidence in government. Public trust reached a three-decade high shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks but declined quickly thereafter. Since 2007, the shares saying they can trust the government always or most of the time has not surpassed 30%.

    Public trust in the federal government, which has been low for decades, has returned to near record lows following a modest uptick in 2020 and 2021. Currently, fewer than two-in-ten Americans say they trust the government in Washington to do what is right “just about always” (1%) or “most of the time” (15%). This is among the lowest trust measures in nearly seven decades of polling. Last year, 20% said they trusted the government just about always or most of the time.


    <b>The Rise of Partisanship</b>

    <i>The Rise of Partisanship and Super-Cooperators in the U.S. House of Representatives.<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0123507">Plos One</a></i>

   It is widely reported that partisanship in the United States Congress is at an historic high. Given that individuals are persuaded to follow party lines while having the opportunity and incentives to collaborate with members of the opposite party, our goal is to measure the extent to which legislators tend to form ideological relationships with members of the opposite party. We quantify the level of cooperation, or lack thereof, between Democrat and Republican Party members in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1949-2012. We define a network of over 5 million pairs of representatives, and compare the mutual agreement rates on legislative decisions between two distinct types of pairs: those from the same party and those formed of members from different parties. We find that despite short-term fluctuations, partisanship or non-cooperation in the U.S. Congress has been increasing exponentially for over 60 years with no sign of abating or reversing. Yet, a group of representatives continue to cooperate across party lines despite growing partisanship.

    -The United States has been running consistent trade deficits since 1976 due to high imports of oil and consumer products. In 2022, the biggest trade deficits are recorded with China, Mexico, Vietnam, Canada, Germany, Japan, and Ireland, and the biggest trade surpluses with the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Brazil, Singapore, Australia, and United Kingdom. Canada is the top trading partner, accounting for 15 percent of total trade, followed by Mexico (14 percent) and China (13 percent).

  <i>The Productivity-Pay Gap.<a href="https://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/">Our World in Data.</a></i>

Most Americans believe that a rising tide should lift all boats—that as the economy expands, everybody should reap the rewards. This outcome can be guaranteed by smart and compassionate policy choices or subverted by policymakers choosing a different path. EPI's Productivity-Pay Tracker shows the shift toward the latter: Since the late 1970s, our policy choices have led directly to a pronounced divergence between productivity and typical workers' pay. It doesn't have to be this way.

The gap between productivity and a typical worker's compensation has increased dramatically since 1979
Productivity growth and hourly compensation growth, 1948-2022

Productivity-Pay Tracker Change 1979-2022: Productivity +64.7% Hourly pay +14.8%. Productivity has grown 4.4x as much as pay. 1948-1979 Productivity +117.5%. Compensation +107.3%.

In 1972, the imprisonment rate was 93 per 100,000 people.11 The prison expansion that commenced in 1973 reached its peak in 2009, achieving a seven-fold increase over the intervening years. Between 1985 and 1995 alone, the total prison population grew an average of eight percent annually. And between 1990 and 1995, all states, with the exception of Maine, substantially increased their prison populations, from 13% in South Carolina to as high as 130% in Texas. The federal system grew 53% larger during this five-year period alone.

Growth in the number of healthcare administrators has far outpaced growth in the number of physicians. Between 1975 and 2010, the number of U.S. physicians grew 150%, roughly proportional to population growth, whereas the number of healthcare administrators increased 3200%. Supporters of this exponential growth argue that increased administration is necessary to navigate changes in healthcare delivery, including advances in information technology, new regulatory requirements, and unprecedented levels of scrutiny. On the other hand, critics say administrator growth increases physician burnout. As administrators impose rules, management procedures, and regulations to streamline clinical processes and achieve the "triple aim" of healthcare, the burden often falls on physicians.

  Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Data. Global carbon emissions from fossil fuels have significantly increased since 1900. Since 1970, CO2 emissions have increased by about 90%, with emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes contributing about 78% of the total greenhouse gas emissions increase from 1970 to 2011. Agriculture, deforestation, and other land-use changes have been the second-largest contributors.

  Carbon dioxide emissions account for the largest share of greenhouse gases which are associated with climate change and global warming. Data for carbon dioxide emissions include gases from the burning of fossil fuels and cement manufacture, but excludes emissions from land use such as deforestation. Oil releases about 50 percent more carbon dioxide than natural gas, and coal releases about twice as much. Carbon dioxide emissions are often calculated and reported as elemental carbon. The unit of measurement is kt (kiloton).
