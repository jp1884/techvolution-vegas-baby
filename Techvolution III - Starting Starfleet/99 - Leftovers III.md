Gene Roddenberry's vision for the future had to do with mankind being at a at a better place he felt that Wars and poverty and sickness were all things that were over with and that man could spend his time seeking a better quality of life he saw human beings as being beyond petty petty arguments which made things quite difficult because in when you're writing drama you you want conflict and gene and want conflict within the core characters of the show so it had to come from outside so that was probably the biggest rule and the hardest rule for for the writing staff we also had to follow to two separate rules of science the the real rules of science to whatever degree we could follow them and the fictitious rules of science that had been set up by Star Trek by the original series and by however much of the new series had come before and it was it was very interesting because we had people working with us who were really experts at science and who would help us with things but then there was you know the things like transporters and warp speed and photon torpedoes and all these things that don't exist but that still had a set of rules attached to it so it was a it was a continual challenge and it was very often very difficult to have to go back to the writers to say you can't do this when in fact they were doing something that seemed perfectly reasonable considering how much stuff within the show was just made up mmm-hmm love the fact that so many of the fans would certainly catch it the roll was broken yeah we once had a phaser come out of photon torpedo port in a visual effect and I certainly didn't know the difference and we got hundreds of letters hundreds you
