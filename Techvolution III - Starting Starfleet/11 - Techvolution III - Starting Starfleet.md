# TECHVOLUTION: STARTING STARFLEET

by Johnny Majic

## Backpage

We'll conceptualize digital tools totally detached from the Industrial Age. These products will make The Computer Age lifestyle one of "perpetual profit." We'll send the massive savings to Musk and his protegees and hence, start Starfleet.

_"...I was one of those people who needed validation in the popular culture when I was growing up and and that's the power of the medium that's one of the things that we're able to do is by telling these stories giving ourselves an idea that you know it's all good we're all in this together that there's a place for you that's what Star Trek represents to people when the future comes there's a place for you and that we will have reached and a part of our evolution as a species where race and class and sex and how much you make a year all of those will have been overcome those are no longer the things that we are so concerned with on a day-to-day basis there's a principle in Star Trek called edik an acronym IDIC infinite diversity in infinite combination and in jeans vision there was an inherent respect for all of the diversity that exists as life throughout the cosmos that's a world I want to live in you"_

# Introduction

## Reminder

**I. A New Philosophy:** This part upgrades our political philosophy to the Computer Age. It gets Main Street to see the big picture that they're all player gods who must use digital tools to solve their own problems.

**II. Building the Life Star:** Explains the new political and economic truth we'll see in the Computer Age with technologies like apps, bio-monitors, and big data. With these and other digital tools, we'll be able to create much more objective definitions of political and economic right and wrong. The Life Star will therefore remove phantom storytelling from our politics. In short, the Life Star will do for politics and economics what scientific instruments did for physics, chemistry, biology, etc. The troubling part is many people won't accept what this new telescope shows us.

**III. Starting Starfleet:** We'll conceptualize digital tools totally detached from the Industrial Age. These products will make The Computer Age lifestyle one of "perpetual profit." We'll send the massive savings to Musk and his protegees and hence, start Starfleet.

## Techvolution

There's never an s in evolution. It's ongoing. Never stops. And thus there is no s in techvolution, because unlike revolutions, techvoluion is constant, our adaptations never stop.

## Our Banquets and Balls

Thought experiment. How did Douglas know freedom was better. How could Techvoluion in 1841 have predicted 1941. Humanity as a character, adapts to technology change, the grandstory. Thus if we predict we'll be on Mars, the moon one day, that means we'll have the technology to do so, and thus we'll have had to adapt to this space/Tesla/SpaceX technology to get it. So what society will Mars require of us on Earth to live.

[note, do that as Douglass, than do it for us today, by posing a question "what will Mars require of us, and then proceed to critique what's in the way of mars today, gasoline, cars as transport, one-use everything, limited access industries, complex tax codes, gold, and whatever...

So Part II, is a thought experiment... Life on Mars]

- Note how protagonists, ex YouTube traversy media and real engineering, are self motivated without getting much help. now that DB is gone, we can give them lots.
- Money is the distance maker from the frontline. not in nature of course, human made rules say it doesn't expire, about that....
- read The Man Behind the Microchip, pg 182, people don't need products (drill bits), they need a way to drill 10 million holes, speaks to the triangle vs circle, items are merely temporary problem solvers.
