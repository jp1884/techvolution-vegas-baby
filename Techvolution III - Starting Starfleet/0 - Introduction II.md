# INTRODUCTION II

## Techvolution

There's never an s in evolution. It's ongoing. Never stops. And thus there is no s in techvolution, because unlike revolutions, techvoluion is constant, our adaptations never stop.

## Our Banquets and Balls

Thought experiment. How did Douglas know freedom was better. How could Techvoluion in 1841 have predicted 1941. Humanity as a character, adapts to technology change, the grandstory. Thus if we predict we'll be on Mars, the moon one day, that means we'll have the technology to do so, and thus we'll have had to adapt to this space/Tesla/SpaceX technology to get it. So what society will Mars require of us on Earth to live.

[note, do that as Douglass, than do it for us today, by posing a question "what will Mars require of us, and then proceed to critique what's in the way of mars today, gasoline, cars as transport, one-use everything, limited access industries, complex tax codes, gold, and whatever...

So Part II, is a thought experiment... Life on Mars]
