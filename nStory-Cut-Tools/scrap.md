I study technological innovation. I want to understand what helps create new technology and what prevents new technology from being developed. It can be hard to research innovation because human self-interest taints our perspective. Humans have so many cultures, politics, ideologies, and religions knowing what helps and hurts innovation is hard to see. It is usually easier for humans to make excuses for their society's failure instead of making improvements.

To help me better study innovation, I'm comparing technological innovation to biological evolution.

The original spiral image is biologists understanding of evolution. When biologists study evolution, there is no favoritism. We accept that as the environment changes, natural selection chooses the best lifeforms to survive in the environment. Any creature that can't compete doesn't survive.

That's why the original spiral is seamless and has no steps. Because we understand evolution very well, we accept moving from the Jurassic Period to the Cretaceous Period means the death of most dinosaurs. Millions of species go extinct, and we accept it with no excuses because that's what evolution does. Life continually adapts new creatures to survive in the environment.

But from the perspective of a species, evolution isn't a seamless progression from one age to the next age. For example, a Tyrannosaurus never left the period in which it evolved. They stayed in Cretaceous Period until they all died.

By separating the spiral into steps, we are looking at evolution from the perspective of an individual species. A ladder connects each step because only a few lifeforms make it from one period to the next. The ones who can't go up the ladder are stuck. That is what the circle at the end of each step represents. The circle is the time when creatures like Tyrannosaurus keep living ("going in circles" is an English saying to describe living but going nowhere) until they die out.

I use the spiral divided into steps to represent humanity's technological evolution. Our travel through technological ages, like the Bronze Age to the Iron Age, is comparable to the change from Jurassic Period to the Cretaceous Period. To fully evolve, we must forget most of our old way of life, climb the ladder and innovate new technology to survive in the new age.

Using biology, I want to explain how technological innovation is like evolution.

Here is the above explanation explained using the steps. The green line represents the lifeforms that climb the ladder as they evolve through each age. The red line represents the lifeforms that will never evolve and keep going in circles until they die and become fossils.
