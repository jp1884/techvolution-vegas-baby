# Earthboat

>The Earth from here is a grand oasis in the big vastness of space.

> Astronaut Jim Lovell, Apollo 8, the first ship to visit the Moon.

When the first humans went around the Moon, they took a photo. We at home could finally see who we are, tiny things traveling on a rock in the middle of absolutely nothing. The [Earthrise photo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthrise) made people understand how fragile our lives truly are.

Of course, the Earth doesn't rise. For that matter, neither does the Sun. We think the Sun does because that's how it looks to us. In fact, the Sun is stationary, and the Earth spins to make it look like the Sun rises and sets every day. With perspective, we realize the Universe has all laws that don't care about our viewpoint.

The famous Earthrise photo should have been Earthboat because it showcased that we live on a tiny lifeboat in a never ending ocean.

Giving us a better perspective is why I wrote this book. The story of Life is the struggle of every lifeform to solve problems fast enough to keep our lifeboat from sinking. You must know how stories work to understand your place inside this story.

Life on Earth got so advanced It can take a photo of its oasis. That's amazingly successful. Evolution is the reason, and we're subject to its laws just as we are with physics.

Technically speaking, the book uses Aristotle's Poetics to better understand Hegelian dialectics to showcase how humanity continues Life's Darwinian evolution via technological innovation. But that's a mouthful, so it's easier to say this book teaches storytelling to explain your society, workplace, and daily life as another tale in the ongoing evolution of Life.

Once you master stories, you'll understand your place on this grand and fragile oasis.
