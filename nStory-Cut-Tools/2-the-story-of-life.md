# The Power of Storytelling

Life is a beautiful story.

How can it not be? It's the ultimate rags-to-riches tale. Our planet was once lifeless. Then over three billion years ago, some cells formed in pools of acid. From that ooze, spunky Life created an almost endless list of bacteria, plants, fungi, and animals. Life turned the third rock from the Sun into an oasis. But success wasn't and still isn't a forgone conclusion. The story of Life has always been very dramatic.

Because Life has a mortal enemy.

That enemy is named entropy, the natural law that says heat always moves from hotter objects to colder objects. Lifeforms must always replenish their energy to say from freezing. More generally, entropy makes everything, from stars to mountains, trees to dogs, eventually, degrade into dust. Entropy can act as quickly as an frigid breeze or as slowly as an ice age, but it's always making the Universe a hard place to live in. Entropy is why Life's rags to riches tale had so many pitfalls, struggles, and five mass extinctions.

And yet, Life survives!

Because Life's representatives heroically fight against entropy. And they're smart enough to fight together, which they do inside ecosystems.

No lifeform can go it alone. Overcoming entropy's constant decay requires many adaptations. As entropy steals energy, Life must find it and harness it fast enough to stay ahead of the theft. Thus, many different plants are needed to turn all available sunshine into biomass. Many varied herbivores are required to eat the vegetation and spread seeds. Many unique predators must hunt the herbivores to limit their numbers. Forming an ecosystem requires a long list of lifeforms. 

Once they do, Life has formed a system that is ready for a fight.

Ecosystems are great because they enforce a system of give and take, checks and balances between all species. Life can be cruel to individuals; sadly, some must starve or be eaten, but Life never plays favorites. In nature, no lifeform has inherited power over another, and anyone can find a way to harness energy better. Life needs an ecosystem full of adaptations solving problems as efficiently as possible. Only then can Life outrun the cold, heat, starvation, and thirst as entropy constantly steals energy and decays the environment.

The story of Life is not a battle of lifeform against lifeform but a mutual race against entropy.

This race is remorseless. If a lifeform finds enough resources in the ecosystem, it will live a few more days. If it doesn't, entropy catches up, takes the last of its body heat, and kills it. Life doesn't cry for too long. Instead, it substitutes another being with a thicker fur coat, stronger bite, or some other adaptation. This unfettered evolution is how Life finds the best problem-solvers who are as efficient as possible.

Unfettered innovation is Life's requirement. It's how Life responds to entropy's constant cold snaps, solar flares, and never-ending robbing out our body heat. Isn't that poetic. Life fought the natural law of entropy by creating the natural law of evolution. 

It is poetic, and the reason why to understand humanity, you need to understand _Poetics_ by Aristotle.

Life's evolution has always been about individuals struggling against entropy to turn the third planet from the Sun into a lifeboat.

And humanity is another lifeform working to earn a spot on the ship. But we do more than live the story of Life; we know our days are filled with heroes and villains, climatic events, and plot twists.

But we're often so busy living the story of Life we can find it tough to reflect on it. We all hope our jobs, products, and lives contribute to Life's fight against entropy. We have many belief systems to help us judge if we're succeeding. But we usually evaluate our beliefs using those beliefs, which doesn't encourage honest reflection.

Since Life is an ongoing story, understanding storytelling helps us see our place in the story of Life and judge if we are helping Life evolve.

That's why this book empowers you to understand stories. Ficticious ones and those in the real world. Using Aristotle's classic storytelling manual _Poetics_, this book explains what makes some stories good and others terrible. It explains what makes villains evil and heroes great. And most importantly, this book explains stories are not about characters fighting over values and opinions but battles to control real things like clean water, food supplies, and faster computers.

This book will connect you to the story of Life by teaching you an easy-to-remember framework that uncovers insights into any story, simple ones like the user experience of an app. More complex stories, such as the daily news. And grand stories like those that drive our economics, history, and politics.

That's not hyperbole. Life is a never-ending battle against entropy, and everyday you live is another page in that story. Thus, to understand humanity's heroes, villains, and plot twists, let's teach you all about storytelling.
