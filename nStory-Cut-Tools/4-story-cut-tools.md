# Story-Cut Tools

So you’ve learned storytelling. A story is a series of events where a character works hard to overcome a problem. Storytellersmust only tell the story and resist the urge to be self-indulgent and trick their audience with atttemps at being interesting.

Staying on target isn’t easy. Stories are created over many hours. Throughout writing sessions a creator must keep on target. Whether sick, hungry, about to get married or living through a war, the creator must detach from their feelings and return to his make believe storyworld.

Creating a consistent series of events that makes a good story is crueling. The turn to interesting scenes like grosteque gore or self-indulgent talk is the mark of a writer not willing to stay in the dirt and work hard to create. 

What does a writer use to guide his work? We can take the lessons of Mamet and Aristotle’s take on storytelling and make some tools for creators.

Steering away from the cult of self will be a bit easier after learning these tools.

## The Ingredients

### Props
Props are the visual apparatus of the play. Sets, costumes, effects are all kinds of props. They each increase the spectacle of things to look at. Props are just there. They have no meaning themselves. They fade usually into the back ground.

Of course some items don’t fade into the background. Occasionally a set will be beautiful and attract attention. And sometimes an item will be very important, like the glass slipper in Cinderella for example.

However, clothing, chairs, rings, and other spectacle make the story look pretty but don’t have any direct relevance to the story until a character picks one to solve the problem of the story.

<figcaption>Props manifest the story in the real world, making it easier to follow and understand</figcaption>

### Passions
What must Cinderella be feeling when first dancing with prince charming. How can a storyteller communicate those emotions to an audience?

Music.

Music conveying and illuminating the pssions behind the story and its characters. A great example is the “Jaws” theme, which creates suspense in the audience with just a few notes so powerful people today still fear the water because of them.

Another example is The Lord of the Rings, whose great score almost tells the story itself. Take a listen, jump around, and you can feel where you are in the story each time. Such is the power of music to transfer the emotions from one person inside a story to another wanting to know what that story feels like.

### Dialogue
The spoken words of a story. Dialogue is how the characters communicate their thoughts to each other and sometimes themselves. Like with props, the difference between words and dialogue is that dialogue should always advance the story.

That’s why the most memorable moments of a movie is often its best lines. “Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.”, “Do you feel lucky punk?”, and “May the force be with you”.

Dialogue is how we know what the characters are declaring what they want be it to destroy the Death Star or marry prince charming.

### Antagonist
While props, music, and dialogue communicate the story to the audience, it’s the characters who live the story. They are human stand-ins for the audience. Fans of the story will see themselves as one of its character.

Every character must be consistent in their characteristics and beliefs and any changes to their character must be explained, which normally means explaining how the events of the plot changed and therefore revealed a character as being, strong-willed, loving, hateful, cowardly, or in the pig’s case, persistent. 

Every story has a problem to overcome. Antagonist personifies the the problem and he represents the way the world is and doesn’t want the world to change. 

This antagonist steps up and defends the status quo. There’s no doubt in his mind that change is bad for himself and society. That is a crucial point. The antagonist doesn’t think of themselves as being evil. They fight for what they believe in.

![Antagonist](/assets/img/romeo_juliet_thought.jpg)
<figcaption>Defender of problems</figcaption>

### Worldview
Socrates became famous for asking questions. He’d ask “what is love?” or “what is justice”. These questions imply love or justice have a specific form like a chair or bicycle. The quest to find deeper meanings to our everyday lives got Socrates many followers who loved him dearly.

Other people weren’t so impressed. They didn’t see the forms Socrates was talking about and thought Socrates was corrupting the youth with his questions.

Socrates caused such a stir because he was probing the established worldview of his society. Our worldview surrounds us everyday. How should the calender be setup, who controls government, how are children educated are not laws of nature but rules written by a human that taken together make a worldview. Just think of the differences between India, Japan, and Brazil today.

Likewise, every story has a worldview. While antagonists and their supporters defend it, heroes and her supporters want to change it. 

![Romeo and Juliette](/assets/img/romeo_juliet_thought.jpg)
<figcaption>Motivation at first sight</figcaption>

### Protagonist
Some people can see errors in the way of the worldview. Socrates did but he only ever asked questions. Other people ask questions and take action. Cinderellla wants to be a princess, the pig owner wants to protect his family.

The hero works to change the world. This drive reveals who their supporters are, and who the antagonists are. But heroes are not philosophers. They don’t write down new social rules and call it a day. Heroes want to change the world.

But how do they do that?

![Protagonist](/assets/img/romeo_juliet_thought.jpg)
<figcaption>Solve of problems</figcaption>

### Plot
A worldview gives people a rulebook to follow. But who enforces these rules. The antagonists of course, and they enforce their rules by controlling the levers of power in a story.

Cinderella is told she's not good enough for prince charming. When she disregards these rules, she's locked up in the attic. The lever of power here is the key to the door and trying on the glass slipper to prove she is the real princess. In the Pig Story, the leve of power is the leash  and the bill of sale which farmer John wants to get someone to sign and the pig doesn’t. 

Whoever controls the levers controls society and can write the rules because they can enforce the rules. The levers can be as simple as the glass slipper or as devastating as the Death Star.

Every story is about a hero having a problem in the worlview that’s enforced with a lever or power. Since debates don’t change much, true heroes attack the levers of power by destroying, seizing, or creating new ones.

And that’s what a story is. A series of beats and scenes that come together to make a plot where the hero and villian battle for control over a lever of power. Incidents should be logical and follow naturally from the actions that precede them. The incidents will be more satisfying to the audience if they come as a surprise, and if the audience at first thinks them to be coincidence; soon, however, the audience must see them as plausible, even necessary.

Props and effects fill out the story. Music helps communicate emotions while dialogue communicates intentions of the characters. The worldview describes the motivations of the characters. Antagonists want to preserve the worldview while heroes want to change it. The winner of the back and forth battle is whoever controls the levers of power.

![Pig: The Movie Triangle](/assets/img/earthrise-10.png)

**Items:** Props range from the a farm in the desert, to space ships, and space stations. There are also fighter jets, lasers, costumes of the famous Imperial Stormtroppers.

**Passions:** Since the audience can’t feel the touch of a real lightsaber for the first time or the fear of enemy fighters shooting missles at you, music evokes that passions for us. Star Wars has some of the most iconic ever made.

**Dialogue:** The dialogue of Star Wars stood out when it was released. Filled with techno terms and weird alien names. But it’s memorable and most definitely communicated the story to the audience. Some of worlds most known words are from this space opera, “I find your lack of faith disturbing” and “may the Force be with you.”  

**Antagonist:** Perhaps the most famous character in movies. Darth Vader was in control, using his sith powers to control the ultimate lever of power, the Death Star, to enforce his control over the galaxy. Darth Vader likes the world as it is and fights to keep it from changing.

**Worldview:** The thought of Star Wars is the Force. It is the mystical power in the story. The good Jedi harness it to empower people with freedom and knowledge. The evil Sith like Darth Vader use the Force to impose their rule over the galaxy.

**Hero:** Princess Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Han Solo, and Luke Skywalker are all heroes of the story. Each sees the world controlled by the empire, wants the world to change, and takes action to change it. Luke is the main hero not because he takes the most risk but because he’s the one who has the biggest effect on the plot.

**Plot:** The Death Star is the ulimate lever or power. And it’s blueprints drive the plot of the story. Princess Leia stole them and enlists help to deliver them to the rebels. Obi-Wan, Luke, and Han help her deliver the plans. Ultimately, it's Luke who uses the Force to destroy the Deathstar and change the world.

## Three Act Structure

As we learned in Mamet's class and his _Pig: The Movie_, every story is make believe. The question is how good will the fabrication be. The elements above, from props to plot, are what's needed to complete the illusion. Like a gourmet meal, once these incredients are properly balanced they all but disappear into a seemingly simple, but elegantly executed, creation.

Thus, every story has many elements but each must serve a simple arc. Star Wars is about a farm boy standing up to evil. Cinderella is about a women overcoming oppression. _Pig: The Movie_ is about a father protecting his family. Breaking Bad is about a good man descending into darkness.

You can see these stories in character names. Luke Skywalker rises above to fight darkness. Neo is the word for new because he's newly risen above his ignorance. Walter White appears to be a clean man. Sam Malone the consumate ladies man of _Cheers_, is always alone. The psychiatrist Frasier Crane always supports people in their lives. Even real life people can have poetic names, the con-artist Bernie Madoff, made off with his customer's money.

These character namess also signify the problem of their respiective stories. Will Luke overcome the empire? Will Neo survive the oppresion of new ideas. Will Walter White keeping descending into darkness. Will Sam Malone ever find love?

Stories thus have a beginning, middle, and end. The first act is the introduction of the problem and the protagonist who fights to overcome it and the antagonist who fights against the protagonist. The second act is where both characters and their supporters fight over the problem. And in the third act, the question of which side will win is answered in the climax. Throughout this process, drama is created by constant questions about how the events will progress and whether the problem will be overcome.

Here is how a three act story is structured.

In a well told story the props, music, dialogue, characters, and plot blend seemlessly. The mark of success is the audience jumping, screaming, and laughter in their seats. All emotions they've commited because their minds are totally connected to the fake reality of a good story.

### Good Story

Not every story is well told. Many don't follow the rules Aristotle and Mamet teach. There are three possibilities for a story.

<p>Spectacle Story Triangle</p>

![Spectacle Story Triangle](/assets/img/earthrise-10.png)
</template>

A spectacle story is mis-balanced between all the elements. The priority is given to props, effects, and loud music. Characters are running for their lives too often to build up tension, reverse the situation, experience setbacks. Movies today are increasingly spectacle. Hence, today we have ever more special effects, 3D movies, movie theater seats that shake (D-Box), ever more sexual content, more horrific horror.

### Art Story

<p>Art Story Triangle</p>

![Art Story Triangle](/assets/img/earthrise-10.png)
</template>

Actor- and director-driven, such art movies are skewed toward the character element of storytelling. When movies have a strongly written plot, the plot naturally becomes more important and doesn’t allow an actor to overact, or a director to overshoot the story. Art films are thus not complete stories with the clear plots that most moviegoers need in order to become.

### Triangle vs Triangle

A story is character working hard to solve a problem. Stories have perspective. As mentioned already, they are not debates with a Socrates like philosopher weighing all the options without biased. Heroes act and we're supporting their story. The antagonist is our enemy because she defends the problem.

We can still gain perspective ourselves by seeing how some of our beloved stories differ if told through the eyes of the antagonist.

## Story Sequels

Sometimes stories repeat themselves. The ending of the conclusion is ignored. And the story starts over. Occasionally, it works out, like in The Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter movies. Each successive story on par with the previous ones. But often there is a degradation. Like taking pictures of a picture, quality suffers with each successive version.

This is because telling a new story is much harder with baggage from an old one. There is a split personality in every sequel because it can't have a conclusion and must start off at an awkward beginning.

We can track the degration. It is one of good story degrading into spectacle.

## Art Counterbalance

As sequels are told, there is an increase in the art stories. Instead of balancing spectacle and art inside a good story, the telling of the same stories causes other stories to balance it out with art.

Here is the rise of spectacle and art inside American movies over the last few decades.
