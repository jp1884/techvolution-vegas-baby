## What Happens Next

Comedians expose thought. They notice irrationalities and make us wonder about our unseen thought. Laughter is a reward for us seeing thought. Jokes inside one society may not be funny inside another because their thought is different therefore the irrationalities are different. However much we love to laugh we can't laugh on demand. Because we have to work to see a glimpse of thought. Thought is that powerful.

Realizations are also seen in comedy. In fact there's a good chance laughter exists because of realizations. The gift of consciousess means beings will understand good and bad fates. Thus to deal with the realizations of bad news, like the water supply is running out, the doctor used the wrong medication after a surgery, or the landing craft door is about to open on Normandy, laughter at the absurdity of life is the only some can to live with self-awareness.
