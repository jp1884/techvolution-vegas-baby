# CHAPTER TEN - THE CLIMAX

## Why Do We Fight

Once upon a time western Europe was very Irish, or Gauls as they were called back then. Gauls were native in moderen Ireland, England, Scotland, Wales, Spain, France, Switzerland, Belgium, Holland, Germany, and Nortern Italy. Between 600 BC to 80 BC they dominated. They even sacked Rome in 400 BC. Unopposed, Gauls were free to live their semi nomadic way of life. Organized into tribes, Gauls lived in wood huts, had basic agriculture, some iron tools, and druids "reading the stars" to tell fellow Gauls what to believe.

By 84, few Gaulic tribes were free. Among them were the Caledonians; who eeked out a living on the northern tip of Britain. Most of the other tribes had submitted, been defeated, or enslaved by Rome. Rome had risen from a small city in central Italy and conquered. Rome made the people's of the known world, including Gauls, provinces of its Empire.

The Roman general Agricola wanted the crumbs; he wanted Caledonia. The Caledonians would be like anyone else. Agricola offered terms of surrender and assimalation. That didn't work. Then he tried to force a decisive battle, instead the free Gauls kept running away. So Rome burned their grain silos. Submit to Rome, starve to death, or fight. Rome didn't care which. The Caledonians choose to fight. They followed their leader Calgacus. Calgacus assembled his people, forged a free army, exhaled for his people to defend themselves against Roman subjugation and slavery. Live free or die!

Tens of thousands of Caledonians fought. The "freefolk" of Game of Thrones fame would be proud. They're probably based on the Caledonians. Both peoples lived a semi-civilized life. Some technology and government to ease the surpises of nature, but still very individually free from oppressive rules and customs. Free to think, move, live as they wanted. Few regulations beyond revered custom, individuality and self-sufficiency. Towns assembled with natural elements, houses, and food taken from nature. Caledonia had an army of individuals who used stout courage to defend their way of life.

In 84, the two sides fought on a plain in Caledonia. Both sides declaring "Live Free or Die!". Both sides thinking they would win. Both thinking they should win because their civilization was the best way to live.

The two sides fought. Blade on blade, flesh on flesh, and the battle of Mons Graupius in 84 was very predictably another Roman victory. You can picture the opening scene to "Gladiator" to get the gist. Barbarians vs Romans and Roma Victa! was yelled yet again over-top mounds of barbarian bodies.

Rome came, saw, and conquered. Rome, it's army, and it's civilization, was unstoppable. Because what did Rome have? The benefits of an advanced civilization. It produced better armor and weapons, it's fighters were very trained and disciplined, it's engineers were ingenious and could make forts, towns, roads, bridges, aquaducts, wagons, and seige weapons as needed. It's leaders were schooled in tactics, philosophy, ethics, and history. It's towns had fresh water and steady food, and it's people demanded victories and peace in exchange for their regulated lives. Rome simply organized resources, human and natural, more efficiently than Caledonians. That's why Rome defeated Etruscans, Carthaginians, Gauls, Germans, Greeks, Britons, Egyptians, and countless other peoples. We know nothing of Caledonians perspective; they didn't have written language. The battle was lost before it was fought.

The Caledonians fought for their way of life. To live free or die. Yet within a few hours of combat they became a fleeing mob. Their army broke, they're entire civilization fled. Collectively they were more willing to die than submit, but individually were more willing to flee than actually die. There were still enough Caledonians to smother the Romans, but all their order was gone. Caledonians, like many peoples, didn't have the collective order to enforce individuals to act in concert the way a civlization must if it wants to do anything useful. In contrast Rome had the foresight to train their soldiers. They were professional, extremely discplined, and followed orders. Thus Roman armies had various units, specialized in various jobs like archery, slingshots, catapults, bridgbuilding, fort building, heavy and light infrantry. All of these were equivalent to a military orchastra capable of such cohesive action individuals strength was increased exponentially. One of many reasons Rome was free to keeping expanding.

Back to the battle, Romans kept killing till night fell. By the time the sun came up, an awful silence had settled everywhere. The hills were deserted, houses were smoking in the distance, and Roman scouts met no one. Calgacus had been right: Rome had made a wasteland and called it peace.

Winter was coming. With his enemies broken and his army stretched thin, Agricola left the Caledonians to their suffering and led his troops back toward their bases in southern Britain.

The farther south Agricola marched, deeper into territory Rome had held for decades, the less it looked like a wasteland. There were no burned-out ruins, no starving refugees; rather, the Roman army saw well-tended fields, bustling towns, and merchants eager to sell to them. Prosperous farmers were drinking Italian wine from fine imported cups, and Britain's formerly Gaulic warlords had exchanged their hillforts for luxurious villas. They sported togas over their tattoos and sent their sons to learn Latin.

Here was a seeming paradox that might have troubled Calgacus, had he been had he been alive to see it, or if he had the history to understand it, or better yet if he was self-ware enough to realize "maybe I should be conquered?". Because to most Gauls on the Roman side of the frontier the explanation for why the Roman Empire was not a wasteland was obvious. The orator Marcus Tullius Cicero put it best a century and a half earlier, in a letter to his brother Quintus, who was then governing the wealthy Greek province of Asia (roughly the western quarter of modern Turkey). This was an excellent posting, but Quintus had temper problems, and the provincials under him had been complaining.

After a few pages of stern elder-sibling advice, Marcus's tone changed. The fault, he concluded, was not all on Quintus's side. The Greeks needed to face facts. "Let Asia think on this," he pointed out. "Were she not under our government, there's no calamity of foreign war and civil strife that she'd escape. And since there's no way to provide government without taxes, Asia should be happy to purchase perpetual peace at the price of a few of her products." This was in fact already true. Pre-Roman ancient Greece, split up and divided amongst various and often warring city-states like Athens, Sparta, and Thebes, was always under threat. And although the battles of Marathon, Salamis, Thermopylae are exciting to read, the need for herioic victoires against foreigners stopped once Rome took over. The Greeks, prone to huge in-fighting, also stopped warring each other too. However, under Rome, Greece was free to prosper. And prosper it did for hundreds of years.

The story is the same across all civilizations. The more Rome, or Qing China, or the British Empire expanded, those inside had safer, more properous lives. The field of battle was consistently won by the more advanced civilizations, advanced by their ability to make keep ahead of entropy.

War brings victory. The same story of Agricola, is the same story for Clovis I, Charles Martel, Charlemagne. They all brough the political peace, that is the soil for a civilization. Rome conquered because it was far better to organize the technology of the day. We can still see Rome's excellent engineering with their aquaducts, bridges, collisions, and roads, some which are still used today. Another example we can watch in movies. Using swords and shields to fight wars, means military units had to stand shoulder to shoulder to protect their neighbor. Soldiers doing the same thing, made each far more powerful. If a person ran away, it was like putting a hole a damn. So Rome solved this problem with extremely harsh penalities for running.

One way was called decimation. It was a punishment used on Roman Legions.  If they disobeyed orders, Legions were decimated by their leaders. Which means groups of 10 solders picked straws and the one who picked the short one was beaten to death by his comrades. Harsh disciple was in the Roman philosophy. Think of that the next time you hear the terms "decimation" or "picking the short straw".

When the gun came however, soldiers still couldn't run, but they didn't need to obsessively stand shoulder to shoulder. Discipline is still a hallmark of good militaries. Yet the stronger the gun got, the more freedom an individual has to step back, duck, take aim. The best armies don't need to decimate their soldiers to bring peace.

When the New Model Army came in 1512, the one that defeated King Charles II in the English Civil War, they were the first ones to learn that lesson. The greater technological power, meant more individual freedom. The royals had a hard time learning that lesson, because well for centuries the jobs of leaders was to enforce discipline, to everyone's benefit. Their loyalty to their job prevented them from learning that lesson, and in turn from learning their job as noble wasn't required now. Political power was distributed to individuals, who could now act more independantly.

## MMOG

A while ago we saw the society from above. We used computers games like _Civilization_ to see how we can use digital technology like Google Maps to see society with a perspective of the entire picture, instead of our biased view inside our own microstories. We also learned to track technologlical changes inside a technology tree, which let us see why technology change is organized into something similar to a periodic table of societal functions.

With learning the three kinds of stories, functional, spectacle, and art, we can see how revolutions form, because characters start thinking they are the purpose of life's grandstory to defeat entropy. As humanity builds technology and adds more lifeforms to his arsensal, humanity participates in the majic of creation.

And inside this is you in your microstory. Now we'll see how Techvolution show look on the individual, inside their microstory, by again looking at computer games. A place where a user is their own player god, and gets to choose their character, and equip them as they want, depending on the story the user wants to tell. From being a Jedi Knight in _Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic_, to a Elven archer in _Lord of the Rings Online_, or an augmented human/cyborg fighter in _Deus Ex_.

Using evolution life tries different biological technologies. No lifeform can be adapted to every circumstance. There's only so many tools a biological lifeform can have. As lifeforms pack on more tools, they get more self-sufficient. The end is a reasonable lifeform, who can assess circumstances, and proactively use and build technology to counter entropy, and even attack it in life's name.

And that brings us to each individual extra in society. Now they can see themselves in teh mirror of modern technology and assess themselves for the road ahead, and make changes as needed.

Here's a sneak peak on what that looks like.









## Sophina's Choice

## The Battle for Tim Kennedy's Heart

Have you ever been stabbed. Robbed. Murdered. Or attempted murder. What about kicked in the face. Maybe you have. Chances are, you haven't. Most people take that personal safety for granted. And they should, because it's so unlikely and especially because they don't think to harm anyone else.

When Rome fell, it was a catastrophe. Here's the live of Rome before it fell to help explain the Roman Peace.

You can choose your own economy. What apps you choose. Choose Netflix, Wikipedia, where you can find it. And it matters most, for the one to win the descendent of the New Model Army, The American Minuteman, and Frances's Corp De Armee. The ones who fight for the heavenly pursuite of justice and good.
