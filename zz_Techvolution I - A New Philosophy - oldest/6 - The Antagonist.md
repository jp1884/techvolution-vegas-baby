# CHAPTER FOUR - THE ANTAGONIST

## Introduction

We want to master revolutions. We can, once we understand our ruling philosophies and the technological development that will discredit them. Digital technologies, gives us a lens to see our society, in a new way, so we can see our our aged ruling philosophy of liberal democractic free-market economics needs to be changed.

You're always the protagonist in your own microstory. Yet are you the protagonist in life's grand story is always an open and hard to answer question. It depends on how well you embrace new technology, and if you adopt it to help life fight off death. Right now we only have a few digital tools like FitBits, GitHub, and Wikipedia, to tell us about our roles in adapting to modern technology.

The best guide we have for now, on whether or not we're adopting modern technology, is our own happiness. Before using, and spreading better technology, like Sophia teaching Douglass to read. Using happiness tells us who the antagonists today. By looking at those who wanted all of us, to keep using the past, whenever we watched a movie, by renting or buying a DVD, at Blockbuster. Here's where we learn how to spot Darth Vader, or better said, Darth Blockbusters, who went down fighting for nobles divine right to rule over giving access to the castle we call property.

## Blockbuster vs Netflix

The divide between happy nobles, and unhappy people is big. Huge actually, and neither side understands the other. Thankfully, it's easy to describe by highlighting the difference between Blockbuster and Netflix. The digital upgrade to home entertainment happened in a few short years and almost everyone in society felt it, and everyone agreed Netflix is better.

Blockbuster and Netflix both help people watch movies, documentaries, and shows on their home televisions. The content is exactly the same. The difference is how the content is accessed. Blockbuster uses limited access technology. The VHS tape, and DVD, are physical pieces of property, that requires physical storage at a store (haha, get it), and physical transportation of a person. This is what makes Blockuster and its nobles like castles. People physical property inherently has limited access, giving the gatekeepers influence to decide who comes and goes.

Netflix is distributed access technology. People access their stories, over the internet. No physical propert to keep, or transport to. There is still a data center holding the information, yet for the users, that matters little. They can access their stories whereever they are. That's why Netfix is distriuted access technology, anybody has the same massive DVD collection, and pays the same price. No stores, no gatekeepers. And thus few nobles.

Let's see how the the transition from Blockbuster to Netflix, highlights who the nobles are, and how we can start to see Darth Blockbusters in real time using digital technology and the methods of techvolution.

## History of Blockbuster and Netflix

Both Blockbuster and Netflix help people watch new content. That's their societal function inside the tech tree. To best understand that, we should look at where movies came from. Because seeing the victory of Netflix, is really understanding the development of technology, used for making, and telling stories. We can track the success of both companies by tracking the technological development along the technology tree; specifically data transmission, data storage, and data viewing technologies.

A movie is a story. And a story is a protagonist addressing a problem through a series of events. The events are organized into a beginning, middle, and end, as the protagonist and antagonist fight over the problem. Organized plays have been told since ancient Greece. 

Movies are recreations of stage plays, with scripts, sets, actors, directors, and audiences — except that movies are not live performances, but are recordings of many performances assembled together using many technologies. Movies thus depend on technology to exist. Among the technologies is a camera to capture images onto a record and equipment to record sound and edit the images and sound into a coherent narrative. The most basic and most important technology in movies is seen in its name, namely the technology to move many pictures through a light source fast enough to give the impression of seamless movement. The film and reel technology to do this was developing in the late 19th century, and it came to fruition in 1894 with the Kinetoscope, which was developed by Thomas Edison’s laboratory.

Movies started in 1894 when Thomas Edison's lab made the Kinetoscope. The Kinetoscope was like a vending machine for movies. It was the first device that moved film fast enough to give the impression of movement, hence the name "moving pictures", soon simplified as "movies". Customers would look through a peep hole to see clips of boxing matches, or dance routines. It was a popular noveltly, kinda like modern GIFs. Film technology kept getting better, and by the 1920's film could be projected onto massive theatre screens, where people went to watch silent movies, where captions and live music would help communicate plot points. In 1927 film was synchronized with sound. Thereafter, the movies had dialogue and music, and thus call tell full three act stories, once limited to a physical theatre, at any movie theatre in the world.

The movies were the product of three upgrades to three technoogies in the tech tree. Data transmission, data storage, and data viewing technologies. Film reels were storing data of picture and sound. The reels were transmitted by motor vehicle. Not too fancy to us, but cutting edge at the time, and vehicle deliveries is how theatres got their film reels which still counts as society function of data transmission. And finally the last tech upgrade was in viewing technology, because film projectors could project a clear moving image with synchonized sound. These three technologies made a product that was once limited to live stage performances.

Storytelling was brought to the masses and the masses loved it. The movies became extremely popular. However, even though full feature stories were librated from the live stage, they were still limited to the physical property of film reels. People still needed to concentrate inside movie theatres to watch them.

Unitl 1948, when new data storage, transmission, and projection techology upgrades made a new product called television. Televisions used a different mixture of technologys. Huge magnetic tape reels, kept at huge broadcasters like NBC, ABC, or CBS. These tape reels we database, like you might have seen on old computers, stored movies, and soon television shows. Thankfully this data wasn't transmitted in vehicle's, but was converted into radio signals and broadcasted out like a radio signal. And finally instead of film projectors, televisions would receive the radio signals, and project them onto their own tube screens. With these three technology upgrades, people could now watch stories in their homes! People loved television even more then the movies.

From the 1950's to the 1980's most of movie, and television technologies would improve. Film reels got clearer, color, widescreen, and even 3D; although film reels were still transmitted by trucks. Home televisions got larger and color although still lagged behind the image quality of the movie theatre. However broadcasters huge magnetic tapes improved their database capacity, and could store ever more shows. And when television data transmission technology got faster with cable and satellites, home televisions could receive more content from the broadcasters databases.

Thus, while some technologies improved, there was still some road blocks. Film reels were still delivered by vehicles, and people at home still had to wait for their favorite problems to be scheduled by the central broadcaster. People couldn't choose their own content on demand.

No matter. The player god kept unlocking technology upgrades. In the late 1980's, and into the early 2000's there were more technological breakthroughs. The magentic tapes the broadcasters stored their content on had gotten small, so small they were made into consumer products. Televisions now got a friend, the VHS magnetic tape reader. Now when a person wanted to watch their own movie, they could buy or rent a video tape. VHS could only store about 2 hours of content, so the options were limited. Regardless semi-on demand watching movies in the 1980's and 1990's, especially popular stories, was extemely common. The most successful video rental company took the name "Blockbuster"; the common term for popular movies.

It wasn't long before even more technology was unlocked, with DVD's and flatscreen televisions. DVD's worked similar to videotapes, except they were plastic disc whose information was digital. Meaning data was stored as "1 or 0", hence the world **digit**al. Plasma or LCD flatscreens televisions were much bigger then tube televisions, and since they were digital too, they showed DVD content in great quality. Mixing DVD's and home theatres was a huge fad. Blockbuster rental stores spawned up everywhere. People drove miles, and paid millions, to watch the stories they wanted, and movie theatre attendence naturally dropped.

The entertainment production and renting industry loved the windfall. People who wanted lots of stories could finally get them nearly on demand. If they bought the DVD's en masse. The technological tree for entertainment enabled home theatres because it was nearly all figital, digital screens, digital storage, but the distribution was still the same motor vehicle that dropped off film reels way back in the 1920's. Hence, people still needed to concentrate around movie theatres, or rental stores, i.e. the castles with the gatekeepres, to acccess their data.

Until they didn't.

The internet, the transfer of digital information that was used for email and webpages since the 1970's, had kept getting better and faster. And in the early 2000's the internet could finally transfer so many 1's and 0's, with hi-speed internet attached to personal computers, it could transfer the contents of a DVD faster then someone driving to pick one up. People could download movies onto their own computers. And within a few years, most people could stream movies in real time.

Here enters Netflix. At first Netflix mailed DVD's to people, yet still used the Netflix because they knew the internet was going to keep getting faster and let individuals stream their own content. It seemed obvious to Netflix internet streaming was the future. After all for 100 years, technology had kept making storytelling more easy to access. This lesson wasn't obvious to everyone. Gatekeepers think their job is to be gatekeepers, like Hugh telling Sophia reading is dangerous.

Please watch this clip. After 100 years of billions of consumer dollars buying movie tickets, televisions, speakers, home theatres, VHS, DVD's, the customers were called thieves. Just please remember the words of King Charles I, and other nobles, who couldn't fanthom no longer being gatekeepers to the castle.

Because we hindsight everyone agrees home streaming is better then renting DVD's. Yet the entire movie industry disagreed. Instead of inserting digital data distribution (internet) along with digital data storage (DVD), and digital projection (LCD), they did the opposite. They made the DVD bigger with HD-DVD and Blu-ray. The industry was so stupid they couldn't even agree on a new DVD standard and expected customers to get two new players.

A official reporter, talking to an official executive, during an official news broadcast. Not a moment of reflection, even when they mention how the music industry was just "decimated" for the same reasons. The technological upgrades hit music son song files are smaller then video ones, otherwise the technological trends are the same. What you watched is humanity not mastering our ruling philosophy. A techvolution would make proactive changes to businesses based on the possibiliies of technology.

By the way, Hollywood owes itself most to a guy named Irving Thalberg. He ran MGM studios in the Golden Age of Hollywood. His productions were so good, it told everyone high quality is the industry's path to profitability. He was so good, the Oscars named their award for making lots of high end movies, in his name. The Thalberg Award, has been awarded once in a generation. Hollywood has no interest in making quality movies. Priracy has nothing to do with it, it's a structual problem, and being run by executives who think people have to choose their product.

And the ruling nobility getting enriched and empowered at the expense of the middle class is in ours. Despite over 100 years of technological development trending towards smaller and faster technology that empowers individuals, despite digital technology being used throughout the movie industry, despite the massive savings digital movie production and distribution the industry was benefitting from, the ruling nobility in the industry expected individuals to fucking drive to and from blockbuster everytime they wanted to watch one fucking movie.

Pirates you might say! People are evil, people are lazy, people are thieves! Really?

Then explain the graph above. If middle class Americans, Canadians are pirates, why didn't Blockbuster stores have steal bars? The same reason why they don't steal Netflix. Blockbuster was a fair deal, until data streaming was possible. Then Netflix was.

The masses are _happy_ with Netflix because the player god did their job; use new technology to help people live better lives. Thats' why "pirates" paid for Netflix, because it used modern technology to help us live better, easier, affordable lives. Happiness is finding making microstories, in line with the grandstory of humanity. The masses became _unhappy_ with Blockbuster because they realized it makes our lives harder, managed, regulated, and expensive.

When we hit the Digital Age in 1968, iTunes, Netflix, Steam and other digital distribution methods became possible. Still far off, but possible to start having a society that empowers individuals with open access, distributed, democratized technology. Tax forms, insurance claims, wedding invitations, doctor questions and answers, university lectures, textbooks, online voting, and so many other things were possible. The quick victory of Netflix shows how ready the masses are to upgrade their society's functions to the digital age. The happy ruling nobility are happy ignoring that, while the unhappy yearn to hurry up distributing the upgrades.

And that's why I made you read a few pages of somewhat dull history. It's the essence of this book and the massive problem our society is enountering today; adapting to the capabilities of technological, and not expecting the old ruling philosophy to keep going.

## Checks and Balances

So streaming movies, was illegal and piracy. The official news broadcast said so, the official movie makers said so. Their own viewers, their own funders, the people whose money they were spending on many banquets and balls of The Oscars and Correspondence Dinners, were breaking the rules.

Of course, the ruling nobility adapted and now they sell digital streaming. So digital streaming is okay. That sounds like a change was made, based on the people's actions. What was it John Locke said about checks and balances on government. That the people can have political security of an all powerful Leviathan, while keeping individual liberty, if political power was divided between executive, legislative, judges, and the people voted their preferences.

So was digital streaming priacy. The economic government said it was. Until the people voted otherwise. That's the simple power of digital technology. It lets people control their own Leviathan.

## Leviathan, Darth Vader, and Luke Skywalker on Main Street

We're on a journey to understand society better. We need to understand all the changes that usually cause revolutions, so we can change society before these failures happen.

And that's where this drawing came from. It shows the human story. The king is the player god, life, or Leviathan, who is really the shared consciouness of the community, filled with extras. Then there's Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. While both are the protagonists of their own story. Life, has a clear winner. The one who helps invent, and spread new technology. That's why there really is a protagonist and antagonist to humanity's development. Revolutions happen when Darth Vader refuses to give up being a gatekeepers, once new technology destroys the job, with better technology. Like digital streaming did for movies, and Blockbuster vs Netflix. Vader refuses to return to being an equal member of the shared consciousness. And then there's concentration of castles, and distributed main st. Anarchy needs concentration for shared security, while technological development inevitably means distribution power to main street.

Techvolution understands this recurring story. It lets us all see, in others and ourselves, when we're Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. Not right away, not like some divine interpreation. But through engaging more inside microstories, to see which way the resolutions are trending. This lets the extras choose sides better.

And that's the characters and setting of techvolution. To understand the journey of society, as we play the game of civilization, we must understand the story of these characters. And that leads us to the beauty of a well told story.

“Man is born free; and everywhere he is in chains.” Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote that in 1762, to help inspire people passed the confines of aged ruling philosophy. All he had was words to fight back with. If we want to step on Mars, cure cancer, stop global warming, we'll never do it with liberal free-market economics. Never. If fucking internet streaming was called criminal by its rulers, they'll never let our species advanced into the stars.

So here's a video, that hopefully is much stronger than words. This ability, to proactively change ourselves to reach the stars. “Man is born free; and everywhere he is free.” Free of being subjugated by our own ruling philosphy, as we live a endless story of techvolution.
