# TECHVOLUTION II - LEFTOVERS

## Stuff

The more tools we make, the more cyborgs we make. Human cyborgology keeps expanding. The more rule books each will have. This makes our politics breakdown. We have to learn we can't just following the "rule book" of being a corporate HR cyborg, or a ticket-taker movie usher, or a Blockbuster store manager.

## Techvolution in Your Corner2

And this return us to ordering anything on the frontline. You're not playing red / blue ideological martial arts. You have a problem. If you vote for a person to represent your interests, they should not every say, "it's not my fault "red/blue" isn't following the rules".

Of course they aren't! Their from a different sport with different rule books. The skill is to mix them.

How, that's not your problem. An elected representative didn't get your vote, they got your order. Whether it being hungry at lunch, rising small business expenses, or incompentent bosses giving themselves raises paid for by unpaid overtime.

Either the representative brings back an object to solve that problem, or can point to someone who has, or they don't. Blaming the other side for breaking the rules makes no more sense then a waitress blaming the supply truck for a raw hamburger, or a wrestler saying a kickboxer cheated during an MMA fight.

Political ideologies are tool kits. Ways of potentially solving a problems. Ours are so old they're based on turning mud roads, paper libraries, horse and carriage into a better civlilzatin. Regardless, your on the frontline, you need tools to solve problems.

It's the politicans job to work with other species. Iron sharpens iron. Debate, argue, back stab, whatever. Yet, like in a kitchen or a martial arts fight, the only thing that matters is the result.



## Left over

We have to learn to  there is out there,

To fight MMA is the ability to be honest and reflective and care about results, not methods. When an MMA fighter goes up against a tak-won-do specialist, the latter keeps saying how the former "breaks the rules". Yet results is the rule.

Science learned the same lesson. You, individually, don't know how nature works. You test it, you probe it was an hypothesis, and use instruments to test your experiment, and then trying to find what answer nature tells us is true.

MMA is the same thing. There is no established rule book. Let the results tell you what to do. So when you watch a MMA fight, and listen to the corner's advice between rounds, what you hear is practical advice on the situation, and how to win the next round like "use kicks, wrestling, try a submission".

What you don't hear is "he's breaking the rules". Because the only natural rule is the natural selection of tools that best solve the problem.

## Canoe Ride

With ordering a hamburger, fighting MMA, and watching a canoe ride, we'll now fix our politics.

## Mixed Martial Politics

I can't do this anymore. I run away when I see a clip or anything. But, if you still can, watch cable news, especially a political debate, and the supposed analysis afterwards. The politician in office will get bombarded by accusations of rule breaking. And he'll defend himself by defending the rules.

When you ordered the bad hamburger, and the waitress said "we used the approved corporate cooking techniques, so it's not our fault the hamburger is raw", would you ever even care? No. The hamburger is raw. I can touch, smell, and taste the truth. I don't care what rule book you followed. The result is the only thing that matters.

When a MMA fighter sits down between rounds and is bloody from being punched hard. If a wrestling coach tells him "keep it up, he's breaking the rules by punching you, that's not allowed in wrestling" that coach is a moron. There are no rules, but adapting yourself to the problem, to get the result.

When a doctor looks through a microscope and says "that's impossible", he's an idiot. We don't learn anything with a personal rulebook, but instead with a blank one that writes down observations, and adapts ourselves to what it says.

Yet, in politics today, we the people, are distracted by fake rules. We pick a team, red or blue, and let our leaders get away with telling us we have to live with bad hamburgers, or getting the shit kicked out of us in a fight. Pundits and reporters are like karate and judo specialists analyizing a true fight, pointing out the "rules" are being broken.

I, and you, shouldn't care at all what methods, ideologies, beliefs, or opinions our elected leaders have. At all. We should only care about the results. I want a atmosphere with less carbon in the air every year. I want less traffic on the roads. I want less car accidents. I want less.. or more of...

All this happeneings are trackable now. And thus, we can track the results of our politial and economic leaders in making them happen. Raise taxes, cut taxes, private health insurance, public health insurance. Whatever way the cook, fighter, or doctor wants is good with the rules.

And based on history, and theory, the ultimate answer to each will be more individual empowerement to pick one's own tools. Only the cook, the fighter, the doctor, the person encountering the problem, knows what tools. And like in any ecosystem, our job isn't tell enforce human rules, but in making sure other lifeforms are being efficient with resources, so we all keep adapting life on, and beyond, Earth.

Lifeforms often fight. Usually over territory or food. Ever notice though how species fight each other differently. Like dualing cowboys they have a ritual. For example, male sheep ram into each other until one submits or dies. But they never fight outside the agreed upon combat system; a beta wolf never murders the alpha while he sleeps.



# Ecosystems

Around March 2011, Donald Trump and his family were guests on The Oprah Winfrey Show. He and his family were answering questions and giving their views on modern culture and politics. It was just before President Obama's re-election. I imagine Trump was testing the waters to see if he should enter the 2012 election.

During the internew Trump said something along the lines of "In South Korea, we have thousands of troops, and I ask, why aren't they paying us for this?"

This one question was all I needed to hear. Whenever he decided to run, Donald Trump would be President. The frontline would hear a rational question. The heirarchy would hear an irrational one. All he had to do was keep up this "irrational rationality" and he'd win.

The reason is also the same one why we can't save the polar bears by sending them to the Amazon, or even to Antartica. Species, and cyborgs, need their own ecosystems.

## Polar Bears in the Amazon

If you were to see camels in Norway, tree frogs in Mongolia, or polar bears in the Amazon you'd automatically see something wrong. Not with the lifeform, we take our kids to visit these cuties in the zoo, but you'd see an obivous mix-match of a lifeform in a foreign ecosystem.

Now when you see SUV’s in Shanghai, daily newspapers in England, American McMansions, coal power-plants in the Sunshine State, and another Spider Man playing throughout the world, you wouldn't see the same mix-match. Even though England has few paper mills, China no oil fields, Florida no coal, or Americans having no desire build and clean their own mansions. You wouldn't see the same mix-match between lifeform/adaptation and it's ecosystem, because you wouldn't see foriegn lifeforms because you wouldn't see different ecosystems, as you automatically do with a polar bear in the Amazon.

When Europe entered the Renaissance and Scientific Revolution, the ruling nobility hit the jackpot. The society's they controlled developed new tools that made them the strongest in the worlds Ships that could travel against the wind, navigate at night, and rule the seas. Guns that could kill from hundreds of yards away. Books that could educate about the best military tactics, navigation, and agriculture methods. The nobles used this power to spread themselves, as they spent the 1500-1900 colonizing the world with their rules.

Yet, these political empires didn't last. And there was nothing that could have made them last. The reason is a simple one. The rules, and way of life of England, France, Spain, is not the way of life that will prosper somewhere else. Nature adapts lifefotms to local problems inside ecosystems. Humans evolve with tools. Thus, we need ecosystems to adapt. World wide rules and empires are like trying to have little biodiversity.

It's impossible. A dream. The European nobility fought to keep it alive for centuries. They fought the wave of independece to local governments could make their own rules, customized for their own political ecosystems.

And now, our world-wide mass produced, free-trade, global rules that sustain the pre-digital tools of suburban housing, blockbuster movies, gas cars, fasionabe clothing are merely the same thing Darth King's political empires. Economic empires of Darth Blockbuster trying to have his economic cake and eat it too.

Darth Blockbuster is trying to make polar bears live in the Amazon. And the extras are stuck using the wrong tools to solve the frontline problems.

## The Buffet Line

Okay Skywalker, so I said to ignore red / blue philosophies. But I'll indulge this one here for your and mine sake. What I just told you, that the world economy has to divide into mostly self-suffcient ecosystems isn't simple. It'll eventually happen, I mean cyborgs from Nova Scotia and Jordan need different tools to prosper for the same reasons their natural lifeforms have different tools to prosper. Their enviornments are totally different. And if the same political laws didn't work in both ex-British empire places, why should the same tools for transportation, agriculture, education, entertainment and so forth.

But this simple observation will cause a huge backlash from Darth Blockbuster and blue / red politics. The ideology of one tool fights all is their meal ticket. The business side wants to sell their tools in every ecosystem, so fights for one world of economy. The cultural side wants to integrate the world's people, and so fights for one world culture. A single world economy is a team effort. And it pays well. And so they'll fight back.

The argument will be basically this. That mass producing tools, even if they aren't customized for a ecosystem, is more efficient. That it's better to have lots of generic foxes, then less customized artic or desert ones. Pre digital tools that might have been true, but with 3D printing, cheap computing, easy knowledge, digital tools, it's simply not. It's better to make whatever tool best solves a frontline problem.

Mountains of think tank policy papers, corporate future plans, consultant forecasts, will say otherwise. Movies, cars, homes, fuel, manufacturing should all be mass produced. Because this generates wealth for everyone to enjoy. International bankers, lawyers, executives at G8 meetings, Davos, Aspen, and others will talk about how world economy products enough to give a buffet of wealth for everyone.

To defeat the attacks, and they will simply attack and not argue, ask for their place in the buffet. So sure, no problem mister 500 dollar an hour lawyer, I'll stick with you, just can we switch wages. I'll write a regulation for climate change action, and you can do technical customer support, with stagnate wages and a boss who keeps threatening to outsource me if I don't work weekends for free.

They of course won't. They'll say they earned their place. And that reveals their identity. They believed in a heirarchy, and they earned their high place in it by following the rules. They want to University and said the right things. They joined an international corporation, and followed the rules, and said the write things. And you didn't. They rose about the frontline and deserve to be rewarded.

But Techvolution is about frontline people solving frontline problems with digital tools. No heirachries, just problem solving. So when you are confronted by the heirarchy wanting you to be a polar bear in the Amazon, just ask them to switch spots.

I don't know everything in life. I don't know much at all. But I do know you'll always still be here. And that should tell you all you need to know.

- without an economic ecosystem, we're individuals trying to win at a team game, and being blamed for our troubles.
- our cyborgology. We see our ever expanding toolboxes, but not the expanded ecosystem of cyborgs it empowers.
- The march of civilization needed an answer. Thus, needed an protagonist to find one. The antagonists would yell about the rules. Social, ethical, economic, political, anything they could use in the spectacle of cable news, newspapers, bureaucarcies, people with the titles of a heirarchy defending their power from an logical question.


# Rousseau's Teachers

Rousseau told taught us alot. He explained what happens when a society lives inside spectacle and art, to hide from the fact the Sith have kept the divide between old societies and new ones artificially too wide. The nobility thinks they are divine, and tricks the people into believe it. Rousseau called bullshit, and with his philosophy made society function again.

Every great thinker builds on the work of others. Issac Newton linage goes on Kepler, Galieo, Copernicus, Aristarchus. Same for Rousseau. Here's where the idea's imbedded into his philosophy. We take note to be sure we include them each into the Life Star.

## Shoulder's of Giants

The first modern protagonist was Niccolo Machiavelli (1469-1527). He was born was poor, but his father got him many books from the recent printing press, and mixing a commoner upbriging with new tools, proved itself again to be a recipe for protagonism.

Printing press books were changing the world. Seemingly overnight, Europe was covered with books of all topics. The ruling philosophy was based on human created rules like nobles divinity and geo-centrism. Quick and easy knowledge let people find different answers, ones increasingly rooted in Nature. Darth King went to work defending his ruling philosophy with a host of rules.

Machiavelli read much Greek and Roman history and philosophy and soon realized humanity didn't need human created rules so much. Machiavelli foresaw a new ruling philosophy where humanity overcomes problems, by using human reason to build new tools. A human written rule book is a crutch, and now an especially unneeded crutch for a society with the printing press and scientific instruments. Humanity could master the many misfortunes of Nature with new tools.

If, Machiavelli said, humanity were to wise up, and ignored the "imagined world" of the human created rules, and judge human actions for their "effectual truth" on making the real-world better or not based on the problems on the frontline. He called this world new "modes and orders".

People answered the call for "effectual truth". They formalized the idea inside the scientific method. Which is the testing of Nature's to find its unbiased rules. Once telescopes, microscopes, and better mathematics were invented, a chorus of people used the scientific method in astronomy, chemistry, and biology.

![Effectual Truth Diagram](img\thewriter\triangle-the-matrix.png)

## Hobbes and Locke

The Scientific Revolution discovered many wondrous details of the universe. Things like the Earth revolves around the Sun, human anatomy, and the laws of motion. Scientists made using the human made rules the basis of all human thought look silly.

And it was in their tradition of questioning the natural world, that spawned the Age of Enlightenment (1687-1789). The Enlightenment was when humanity itself "wised up" by directing scientific questions to better understand not just physical nature, but human nature.

Now Thankfully, it wasn't long before dress wearing, banquest obsessed, cake eating, self-described divine nobles, were under the spotlight of effectual truth.

Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679), writing during the chaos of the English Civil Wars, started the long process to give Europe a new political ruling philosophy. He started it by defending an absolute monarchy, saying a super strong government is the cure against chaos. Hobbes said everyone should obey one king, who he called Leviathan, to avoid the anarchy that makes human life that is "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."

How Hobbes justified his nobility was monumental. Like Machiavelli, Hobbes disliked human created rules, so he didn't use the "divine right to rule". Instead, he said humanity is naturally, in our State of Nature, equal. The State of Nature is a place without government, where we're all equal because... well whose to say otherwise. Hobbes biggest proof of our equality is, without government, we can all kill each other with our ability to scheme, plot, and murder. So to keep everyone from killing each other, the people should forfeit their natural rights of equality to a Leviathan to ensure everyone's security.

Thus, _the King_ and _the People_, would have a social contract with each other. One based on equality, that ends in complete tyranny, but that guarantees everyone's security from the anarchy. This reasoning, believe it or not, started the liberalism that we have today. From constitutions, to the right to own property like race cars, and the right to control ones body with abortions, all guaranteed by the social contract between the people, and Leviathan, or what we call government. Guaranteed if these rights didn't threaten the country's all important security.

We'd recognize Leviathan better after reading John Locke (1632-1704). Locke says it's too idealistic to expect one person to be Leviathan. If power corrupts, then absolute power corrupts absolutely. Thus, Locks says its best to divide government's Leviathan powers up in executive, legisative, and judicial branches. Each would "check and balance" each other, to prevent a government that's worst than the anarchy it's supposed to get rid of.

Locke's philosophy is behind our written constitutions, bills of rights, elected governments, citizens right to bear arms, checks and balances between executives, elected legislatures, lawful judges, freedom of speech, and freedom of religion. Mass printed books, guns, scientific instruments and many others, were enshrined by Locke into society's ruling philosphy, via constitutions. Most people today live under Locke's Leviathan.

Rousseau (1712-1778) liked, but disagreed with, Locke and Hobbes. Yes, humanity is naturally equal, but said humanity is only murderous in a society. If a thinker goes back farther into human nature and history, they'd find happy-go-luck hunter gatherers who weren't filled with the envy, jealously, or anxiety of modern humans living under unnatural ruling philosophies. This is where Rousseau's philosophy, "Man is born free; but everywhere he is in chains" that we discussed earlier came from. Rousseau says yes society needs a social contract, but one that harnesses the natural goodness of humanity.

Rousseau thus keeps Hobbes' social contract, but wants to create a new person to live inside it. Rousseau's Leviathan is not concentrated into a single person, or even a checked and balanced government, but is distributed throughout society via direct democracy. Meaning there are no representatives of government inside a nobility, or a elected representatives. Instead, all people who live under the all powerful Leviathan, also control the Leviathan.

To have this new society, requires a totally "new person". Someone who can give responsible commands to society, while accepting the rules society gives back.

Once Locke and Rousseau's ideas spread, democratic nation states emerged from the feudal kingdoms. The number of wars declined, because once the extras fighting the wars on the battlefield ruled their society, they didn't want more wars than absolutely necessary. Empowering the people breeds collaboration not competition.

We can see this best in our militaries. The armies of kingdoms were loyal to their king. Kings only answered to themselves. Thus, their militaries weren't often volunteers, but conscripts and paid mercenaries. They often looted and pillaged to make their money.

However, the armies of George Washington and other democracies were different. They were fighting not for a human made rule, but for Nature. Understanding nature empowers everyone. Thus, democractic soldiers don't need to loot and pillage and swear loyalty to any other man. They fight for liberty.

These are the lessons of Rousseau. We must uncover the effectual truth, to discard our imagined world, and make a new reality embedded with Nature's lessons. This, means we're all naturally equal, and must live inside a social order with checks and balances, with the freedom of speech. Ideally its best to make each person responsible for their actions inside this Leviathan of a society.

As it happens, what Machiavelli to Rousseau were talking about is making ecosystems. And that's what we need to do for ourselves. Once we do, the rest will fall into place.


# LIFE STAR

Have to integrate the next several chapters into a Life Star sequence, and use these topics as filters, toggles, moons of Jupiter, to showcase a ruling philosophy that, like a physicist and biologist does today, uses science to find the truth, not personal opinions absent of better sensory input like telescopes, microscopes and such...

- There's something about Life Star, and Sun, and knowledge, telling us the age/rules. The Sun tell us our age in revolutions, but Life Star tells us our scientific age.
- Notably, once Techvolution frees people to choose their own tools, it's the majic of millions of people, that builds our Life Star.
- Life Star is technological representation of nature. Like an ecosystem, it enforces accountability and reciprocation between lifeforms and thereby the Techvolution of life.
- red / blue, start seeing individuals as contractors, going through life, not 9-5 people who need to and from work and find something to do on the weekends.
- and civilization story gets a big upgrade.  We need to change our ruling philosophy to take advantage of digital tools. Only you can make it happen. That doesn't mean we replace red/blue, it means we disable the Sith from every coming back.
- People will never stop following the rules. Anarchy doesn't work. The key to victory is changing the source of the rule book, from human rules, to Nature's. Just like science did.
- the way to fight back against human rules/philosophies, is not to have a philosphical argugment of "better", simply track resources like in Nature. ex. how many laptops are totally replaced, rather then repaired, because repairability is so hard. and factor in this number/cost when buying/insuring the tool.
- Rossman, think of neighbors as my source of help, not my source of competition. we have to know each other's "business" to have each other's back. Fight back with Life Star knowledge is power, not only regulation battles.
- With Techvolution, you won’t fight political battles with bristol boards or painted faces. You’ll economically exercise your right to vote, by deciding which tools best solve your problem at home, work, and play. Unlike me, you’ll never need to deal with any gatekeepers, because you won’t have to knock at anyone’s door asking permission to do what’s best for you. Only nature's rules will end the gatekeepers.

## Fish Eyes

How did life evolve eyes. It's not like one day a lifeform woke up and had 20/20 vision. Adaptions are gradual. The first eyes were cells in a bacteria that simply said light and dark. But this new tool let these bateria cells probe the environment and sense day and night, and up and down. It worked wonders in the story of life because they found resources better. Tools increase our senses, helping us find and harvest resources better. Tools spread life.

Fast forward hundreds of millions of years, humanity had excellent 20/20 vision. We could sense colors, distance, and depth. It's not like these things weren't always there. Life just couldn't sense them before.

Yet our excellent eyes could only see so far. Looking at the brilliant universe, our minds wanted to make sense of the colors, lights, and revolution of the sky. Myths abounded about running foxes, warring giants, and fireflies stuck up there. The biggest question was the simplest. Are we moving, or is the Universe? Our eyes couldn't tell.

Ancient Greek's had two big ideas. Aristotle said the Earth stood still. If it moved, why don't stars in the sky change position. Look at something far away, open and close one eye at a time. Notice how it moves. So why don't the stars move too? Aristarchus said the Sun is way bigger than the Earth, surely we must revolve around it, and the stars don't-look like-they move because they're extremely far away.

The best minds in the world choose the wrong answer. From Aristotle in 300 BC, to Issac Newton in 1600. The Sun revolved around the Earth. They believed it so much they said the Holy Bible even agreed. People used Plotemy's "epicycles" to explain the planet's movements and make navigation and weather pattern charts. They worked well enough, but since the premise was wrong they had to change the math every once and a while.

When Copernicus rediscovered Artistarchus, he thought maybe if the Earth revolved around the Sun, the math would make more sense. He tried it, and it did, although he kept assuming planets move in perfect circles so even his updated math wasn't perfect. He was so scared of insulting the ruling philosophy and its rulers he only publised his work on his deathbed. The powers that be didn't like questioning a huge pilar of science, religious, and political mythology. When Friar Bruno (your name sake) went from city to city proclaiming the Earth moved, the Universe had many worlds, and lots of other stuff, Darth Geocentric burned him alive. Let the others be warned.

Then Galileo made his telescope. It was a primitive telescope with hazy lenses made from hazy glass, but magnified our excellent 20/20 vision about 23 times. We were no longer primitive lifeforms with insufficient senses. Instead of merely telling the difference between up and down, day or night; we could now tell the difference between moving and not moving.

Many Sith lords tried to stop the new truth of new tools with a mountain of rules. Yet the people majically bonded anyway. They probed the environment and sensed the many errors inside the ruling philosophy, mainly the "nobles right to rule", that was enforced to keep the art loving and spectacle making, hierarchy alive. The classic story of tools solving real life problems won out like always.

With no tools like the telecope, microscope, spectro, and other scientific instruments, any and all human made rule books to explain the Universe in physics, biology, chemistry, botany fell down. With enough senses we probed the rule book called Nature.

Before digital tools, we may have had bacteria eyes to indicate light and dark, but we had no telescopes to probe for clear economic and political answers. We did our best with human made rule books and learned by trial and error in the dark. We searched for visions of the just and good society and did very well finding it at times with strong human virtues, but most of our battles was against Darth Blockbuster, not against Nature.

Digital tools are to politics and economics, what the telescope was to astronomy and physics. The Life Star isn't about bringing any heirarchies down, it's about bringing the frontline out of the dark.

- Evolution empowers life by giving every new lifeform a slightly different variation. With variations life can constantly test for environmental changes in things like water levels, temperature, and food supply. The variations unfit for the frontline die off. The fittest survive. This natural selection is how evolution finds which lifeforms best represent life on Earth.

## What Happens Next

If I could you what to think Stargazer, I'd say this to myself "I destined bring the Force to human evolution, by building the Life Star."

We don't know exactly what it is. Yet we have a great starting point. It's opposite. Light is the opposite of dark the same way full is the opposite of empty. Knowing one, defines the other. The Death Star is a rule book written humans. The Life Star is the opposite of the Death Star.

So what is it? The Life Star is a rule book no human can write. Rules can't be added, fudged, or abused, only uncovered. Happily, we already use this rule book. It's helped us truly understand our world in areas like chemistry, biology and physics. Of course I'm speaking about Nature; where scientists often feel the majic of discovering rules. Thus we replace human-made rule book, which Darth Blockbuster can so easily corrupt, with one that is uncorruptable.

The chemists, physists, doctors, and engineers who already use Nature often argue, and debate. They settle their differences much more often with tests of the uncorruptable rule book. Many happily think "failure is always an option", because while we can't add rules to Nature, we can strike off possibilities and thus get closer to an answer.

I'll explain how we use Nature to make the Life Star by asking you a question you can't answer. How old are you?

## The Life Star's First Brick

How old are you. Simple question solved by simple math. Start from your birth day and count how many times you've circled the Sun. It's a fact in all our laws, religions, and science. When we compare each other, objects, or thoughts, we use birthdays. That is how we tell time.

What if someone told you, like a witch or wizard, when you die. Would you still count the days past? Or would you start counting the days left? Wouldn't we live better if we knew our deathday? No more thinking we'll make up for wasted time "later". How many days in traffic, useless meetings, or stress inducing interviews are fueled with "later”? Later implies endless life, stories, and growth. Later is a lie. That's why no stories are about later. Because the stories worth telling happen now. To really live, we must realize our story ends.

If we want a great life, we need to know our deathday. Outside of an asteroid hitting the planet, a rare disease, or some other calamity, let's find it. In fact, we're inventing this tool to find it. We'll give you life by telling you when you die. How exciting! Better yet, you can control this tool; the more good choices you make, the better health you have, and the more life you buy.

Enter our first problem. We don't know what good choices are. Today we notice trends and point out "good choices" with diets, religions or ideologies. But there's a gap in knowledge for your specific life. Because your choices are not tailored for your genetics, diet, or circumstance. To give you more life, we must know much more about yours.

So, our new tool must track everything you eat and do. Only then can we empower you to buy better health and live a better life. We'll get to work. Once we're done making this new tool would you buy it? Maybe for someone's birthday?

Don't, because you already own it. So do you all your friends. Even your enemies. Your body is that tool. Your body tracks exactly what you do, and determines your health. Outside of calamity, your choices do determine how healthy you'll be and when you'll die.

So why don't we know more about our health? Why is our deathday and good choices such a mystery. The problem isn't our bodies. Nature did a great job. Our natural senses can't tell us our health because our prosperous economy made us independent of natural limitations. Prosperity gave us unfettered choices. Our natural senses can't read our biology fast enough to compensate. Smell, touch, taste, sight and sound are not good enough to warn of diabetes, cancer, or depression. Thus, it takes years for our unfettered choices to becomes problems big enough to notice with our biological tools. Today we compensate with medicine to reduce bad health and recommend better choices. We're getting better. Still each person doesn't know, at the point of decision, which choice is good or bad. So we live in ignorance and in bad health.

This is good news. Because the Life Star for health doesn't need to invent anything new. It only needs to detect what's already there by augmenting our natural senses with better cyborgology. We need to track what we eat and do, and regularly test our bodies. This way we can analyze which choices improve, or hurt, our health. Thus, we can buy more days, know our futures, and finally enjoy our stories.

What will happen when we invent the Life Star and see ourselves in a new light? Let's look at history. What happened when we invented the glass mirror? The modern mirror is a very advanced tool. It was made in the 14th century but not perfected and mass produced until the 19th century. Imagine what it was like seeing your physical self for the first time. No more guessing, no one else's opinion, no more using a polished piece of metal; only the truth. Today, mirrors show us a reality we all take for granted. A mirror empowers you to see your face, your technique, your youth, your wounds, your smile. Now we are inventing a new mirror. A new tool that similarly shows us the truth in real time. And what will happen when we see our psychological selves as if looking at a mirror?

We get a more accurate reality. Don't say it's impossible. Nature's infinite Universe dazzles us (whenever we look) to know impossible is nothing. The health version of the Life Star is a new psychological mirror that will change human decision making and taste and thereby solve our poor health with.

In fact, we already are. Fitbits, smartwatches, and genetic testing are just the beginning of the Life Star. We're well on the path to showing ourselves the consequences of our actions in real time. The Life Star's been in development for decades. Even if we didn't realize it, we'll soon see our psychological selves in a new mirror. No more polished pieces of metal, opinions, or guesses. Soon we'll see the truth.

The truth is we'll probably never know our deathday. But we'll get close. We'll see which choices give us vitality. The vitality to live a great story. Because knowing how many steps you took yesterday, tells you how many steps you could take today. And knowing how many total steps you've taken, roughly tells you how many days you have left to take them. The Life Star will show us, and everyone around us, our vitality. Our biological sense will get augmented. And after that, we'll be empowered to live like we're dying. We'll have the best of both worlds. We'll have a prosperous economy and the ability make good choices inside it. Because the truth of a mirror is too clear to ignore.

## More

That was just a creative way to say we don't know jack. And it's only with tools we learn anything.

Galileo's telescope changed the world. For centuries everyone thought the Earth was the center of the Universe. An ancient Greek genius named Aristarchus said we revolved around the Sun, he used a well, the tower of Alexandria, and the pytagoran theorum to correctly figure out the relative sizes of Earth, Moon, and Sun, and reasons why the humongous Sun would revolve around a tiny Earth.

But, with the naked it, it looks like it does. So, that's the answer the world put into the rule book. Copernicus used modern math to say maybe Aristarchus was right. Friar Bruno advocated "Copernicism" very publicly and was burned alive.

Galileo advoated just like Bruno did, except he said sorry when facing the antagonists. Under his breadth Galileo did stick it to him by saying "but it moves".

Most people know Galileo and not Bruno because of the former made a telescope. He literally saw the truth himself, and wrote books about what he saw. The telescope made new cyborgs who majically bonded with the new tool, and obsessively made it better and better.

The first image is always gritty. But it's still magical. This is what it looking through Galileo's telescope saw. This image led humanity away from human made rules, and into the one of Nature made rules. We're doing the same with our Life Star.

## We Don't Know Jack

We've lived under human made rules for centuries. Economic policy, political ideologies, product design, manufacturing, and marketing are all based on what we sense with only our biological tools.

We don't even know how old we are, or our probable death date. Ask a veterinarian bringing a abandoned dog back to health. She'll know its weight, height, blood work, exercise requirements, psycological profile, and tailor a meal, exercise, and socialization plan for it.

We decide our food by walking down an aisle and picking up a item for no more reason than Darth Vader is on it.

It's not our fault. Our cyborgology simply doesn't sense the better choice yet. Blaming the bad health choice is like blaming the dog for being abandoned. And if you have perfect health and thus think you can criticize, this is only one area whereby our human made rules ruin us. Ask yourself this.

How much money do you have, is not the same as asking how much money are you worth. Do you work to make a contribution to your economy, or your company. Are you naturally generous, or selfish. How often do you have psychological evaluations. What about blood work? How do you track your diet? Do you even think of your cyborgology? Do you understand the effects of walking to work versus driving in traffic? How often do you fly? How big is your own personal hole in the ozone layer? Do you buy American or foreign? Do you love the majic of teaching new tools, or the dark majic addiction to old ones?

That's only a fraction of what the Life Star will show us. Things get real interesting when we point the Life Star at our society.

How old are our roads. Should we rebuild them, or make internet faster and cheaper instead. What about our sewage system, what's it cost to maintain, rebuild, and are there better options. What about insurance, how much is spent on damages, verus administration.

The pay gap, does it exist, and if so specifically where, when, and with who. Who joins the military and volunteers, which populations, which persons, which cultures and religions contribute more often. What's the social trust between ethnicities. What effect does many different languages have on societies. Does white flight still exist, and if so when and who, specifically.

If you feel angsy asking these questions, you should. Remember Friar Bruno. He was burned alive just for saying human made rules would fall to Nature. But also remember Sophia. The majic of new tools, is stronger than the safety of using old ones. Digital tools will tell us these answers anyone.

Like with science, its the person who asks them first, who wins the power of knowing the natural truth.

## Stuttering ~~Helped~~ Teaches This Lesson

I already told you about my stutter. I'll use it again her to make a point. My first language was gibberish. No joke. Until grade 3 nobody had much idea what the heck I was talking about. Most people's speech dysfluency (saying "ah", "eh", "umm") is about 5% of their words. Mine was probably 80%. Come grade 3 my teacher and the school's special education teacher told my parents I needed an assessment to find out what was wrong.

I still remember that intelligence test. Among some pluses and minuses, speech therapy was recommended (and thankfully) paid for by the public school board. So I was a nine year old, being told by a psychologist, I had a problem with my genetics, and I needed therapy, grueling therapy at times, to fix my genetic problem.

Speech Therapy helped a lot. Specialists using techniques and tools to help me overcome my problem. My dysfluency got to about 80%. Still very noticeable at times, and still hard to live with, but I started using the phone. My first call was to a pet store asking if they had huskies.

This story illustrates life under the Life Star. I was lucky my problem was noticable by our biology. Even though the impediment is still a mystery, speech therapists really know how to help. Even when that jerk VP said I was an embarrassment, I knew the techniques to use again, to really beat the gremlin because of speech therapy.

Like inside any ecosystem, the more lifeforms there are, the faster the pain of the frontline is felt, adapted to, and solved. More lifeforms probe

Now, imagine people prone to depression, eating disorders, or stupid economic policies. Today these people only meet their specialist after suffering years of depression, being way over or under weight, or with needle marks in the arms. They suffer because they don't know themselves. And everyone's got a thing to work on, be it arrogance, self-pity, shyness, or whatever.

- protagonist always used the Nature rule book. They invent new tools to solve problems. Onec an only solve problems by assessing reality, not the imagined worlds of human made rules.
  
_The unknown knowns. These are the things we don't know, that we know. This category (of knowledge) absolutely fascinates me. One of the things that we already have the knowledge or the tools to understand, but don't yet. For example, before we know that galaxies were seperate islands of stars outside of our own milky way. A meticulous chap named Messier in 1771, classified all the fuzzy things in the sky that weren't stars. The 58th object, in his extremely detailed list, was actually a galaxy that was 68 million lightyears away. This was the most distant observed object in the universe at the time, he just didn't know it._
