The more tools we make, the more cyborgs we make. Human cyborgology keeps expanding. The more rule books each will have. This makes our politics breakdown. We have to learn we can't just following the "rule book" of being a corporate HR cyborg, or a ticket-taker movie usher, or a Blockbuster store manager.

And this return us to ordering anything on the frontline. You're not playing red / blue ideological martial arts. You have a problem. If you vote for a person to represent your interests, they should not every say, "it's not my fault "red/blue" isn't following the rules".

Of course they aren't! Their from a different sport with different rule books. The skill is to mix them.

How, that's not your problem. An elected representative didn't get your vote, they got your order. Whether it being hungry at lunch, rising small business expenses, or incompentent bosses giving themselves raises paid for by unpaid overtime.

Either the representative brings back an object to solve that problem, or can point to someone who has, or they don't. Blaming the other side for breaking the rules makes no more sense then a waitress blaming the supply truck for a raw hamburger, or a wrestler saying a kickboxer cheated during an MMA fight.

Political ideologies are tool kits. Ways of potentially solving a problems. Ours are so old they're based on turning mud roads, paper libraries, horse and carriage into a better civlilzatin. Regardless, your on the frontline, you need tools to solve problems.

It's the politicans job to work with other species. Iron sharpens iron. Debate, argue, back stab, whatever. Yet, like in a kitchen or a martial arts fight, the only thing that matters is the result.



## Left over

We have to learn to  there is out there,

To fight MMA is the ability to be honest and reflective and care about results, not methods. When an MMA fighter goes up against a tak-won-do specialist, the latter keeps saying how the former "breaks the rules". Yet results is the rule.

Science learned the same lesson. You, individually, don't know how nature works. You test it, you probe it was an hypothesis, and use instruments to test your experiment, and then trying to find what answer nature tells us is true.

MMA is the same thing. There is no established rule book. Let the results tell you what to do. So when you watch a MMA fight, and listen to the corner's advice between rounds, what you hear is practical advice on the situation, and how to win the next round like "use kicks, wrestling, try a submission".

What you don't hear is "he's breaking the rules". Because the only natural rule is the natural selection of tools that best solve the problem.

## Canoe Ride

With ordering a hamburger, fighting MMA, and watching a canoe ride, we'll now fix our politics.

## Mixed Martial Politics

I can't do this anymore. I run away when I see a clip or anything. But, if you still can, watch cable news, especially a political debate, and the supposed analysis afterwards. The politician in office will get bombarded by accusations of rule breaking. And he'll defend himself by defending the rules.

When you ordered the bad hamburger, and the waitress said "we used the approved corporate cooking techniques, so it's not our fault the hamburger is raw", would you ever even care? No. The hamburger is raw. I can touch, smell, and taste the truth. I don't care what rule book you followed. The result is the only thing that matters.

When a MMA fighter sits down between rounds and is bloody from being punched hard. If a wrestling coach tells him "keep it up, he's breaking the rules by punching you, that's not allowed in wrestling" that coach is a moron. There are no rules, but adapting yourself to the problem, to get the result.

When a doctor looks through a microscope and says "that's impossible", he's an idiot. We don't learn anything with a personal rulebook, but instead with a blank one that writes down observations, and adapts ourselves to what it says.

Yet, in politics today, we the people, are distracted by fake rules. We pick a team, red or blue, and let our leaders get away with telling us we have to live with bad hamburgers, or getting the shit kicked out of us in a fight. Pundits and reporters are like karate and judo specialists analyizing a true fight, pointing out the "rules" are being broken.

I, and you, shouldn't care at all what methods, ideologies, beliefs, or opinions our elected leaders have. At all. We should only care about the results. I want a atmosphere with less carbon in the air every year. I want less traffic on the roads. I want less car accidents. I want less.. or more of...

All this happeneings are trackable now. And thus, we can track the results of our politial and economic leaders in making them happen. Raise taxes, cut taxes, private health insurance, public health insurance. Whatever way the cook, fighter, or doctor wants is good with the rules.

And based on history, and theory, the ultimate answer to each will be more individual empowerement to pick one's own tools. Only the cook, the fighter, the doctor, the person encountering the problem, knows what tools. And like in any ecosystem, our job isn't tell enforce human rules, but in making sure other lifeforms are being efficient with resources, so we all keep adapting life on, and beyond, Earth.

Lifeforms often fight. Usually over territory or food. Ever notice though how species fight each other differently. Like dualing cowboys they have a ritual. For example, male sheep ram into each other until one submits or dies. But they never fight outside the agreed upon combat system; a beta wolf never murders the alpha while he sleeps.
