# TECHVOLUTION: BUILDING THE LIFESTAR

by Johnny Majic

## Backpage

Are you happy? On the outside, Westerners have flashy products, full employment, and stable politics. On the inside, our middle-class deals with stagnate wages, crushing debts, antisocial behavior, political hatred, climate change. We have the freedom to vote Left or Right, moderate and extreme, and we've tried them all, but none have helped.

In this book, I argue our unhappiness is a sign of a bigger problem. Our ideologies are very outdated. They were created in the Industrial Age, and since 1970, we've been in the Computer Age. Our ideologies are holding us back, which is causing our frustrating lifestyles and growing social problems. We need a new philosophy—one created to harness the remarkable potential of electronic tools.

Here it is. Its big lesson is this. The middle-class has to step up and use digital technology to solve our own problems. If we don't, we'll keep suffering the pains of civilization running on old—ideological—fumes.

# Introduction

## Here's the Grand Mission of Techvolution

Writer David Mamet once said being free from trying to please a group means being free to concentrate on Nature. So I embraced obscurity and was quite ambitious when writing this book. Saying that Techvolution is divided into three parts:

**I. A New Philosophy:** This part upgrades our political philosophy to the Computer Age. It gets Main Street to see the big picture that they're all player gods who must use digital tools to solve their own problems.

**II. Building the Life Star:** Explains the new political and economic truth we'll see in the Computer Age with technologies like apps, bio-monitors, and big data. With these and other digital tools, we'll be able to create much more objective definitions of political and economic right and wrong. The Life Star will therefore remove phantom storytelling from our politics. In short, the Life Star will do for politics and economics what scientific instruments did for physics, chemistry, biology, etc. The troubling part is many people won't accept what this new telescope shows us.

**III. Starting Starfleet:** We'll conceptualize digital tools totally detached from the Industrial Age. These products will make The Computer Age lifestyle one of "perpetual profit." We'll send the massive savings to Musk and his protegees and hence, start Starfleet.

## Our Problems
What problems do we have? Not enough people go to college. Read the newspaper. Go to church? What about climate change, national debt, lonliness, mental illness?



# LIFE STAR

Have to integrate the next several chapters into a Life Star sequence, and use these topics as filters, toggles, moons of Jupiter, to showcase a ruling philosophy that, like a physicist and biologist does today, uses science to find the truth, not personal opinions absent of better sensory input like telescopes, microscopes and such...

- Adapative radiation, happens in humanity inside every new age.
- There's something about Life Star, and Sun, and knowledge, telling us the age/rules. The Sun tell us our age in revolutions, but Life Star tells us our scientific age.
- Notably, once Techvolution frees people to choose their own tools, it's the majic of millions of people, that builds our Life Star.
- Life Star is technological representation of nature. Like an ecosystem, it enforces accountability and reciprocation between lifeforms and thereby the Techvolution of life.
- red / blue, start seeing individuals as contractors, going through life, not 9-5 people who need to and from work and find something to do on the weekends.
- and civilization story gets a big upgrade.  We need to change our ruling philosophy to take advantage of digital tools. Only you can make it happen. That doesn't mean we replace red/blue, it means we disable the Sith from every coming back.
- People will never stop following the rules. Anarchy doesn't work. The key to victory is changing the source of the rule book, from human rules, to Nature's. Just like science did.
- the way to fight back against human rules/philosophies, is not to have a philosphical argugment of "better", simply track resources like in Nature. ex. how many laptops are totally replaced, rather then repaired, because repairability is so hard. and factor in this number/cost when buying/insuring the tool.
- Rossman, think of neighbors as my source of help, not my source of competition. we have to know each other's "business" to have each other's back. Fight back with Life Star knowledge is power, not only regulation battles.
- With Techvolution, you won’t fight political battles with bristol boards or painted faces. You’ll economically exercise your right to vote, by deciding which tools best solve your problem at home, work, and play. Unlike me, you’ll never need to deal with any gatekeepers, because you won’t have to knock at anyone’s door asking permission to do what’s best for you. Only nature's rules will end the gatekeepers.

## Fish Eyes

How did life evolve eyes. It's not like one day a lifeform woke up and had 20/20 vision. Adaptions are gradual. The first eyes were cells in a bacteria that simply said light and dark. But this new tool let these bateria cells probe the environment and sense day and night, and up and down. It worked wonders in the story of life because they found resources better. Tools increase our senses, helping us find and harvest resources better. Tools spread life.

Fast forward hundreds of millions of years, humanity had excellent 20/20 vision. We could sense colors, distance, and depth. It's not like these things weren't always there. Life just couldn't sense them before.

Yet our excellent eyes could only see so far. Looking at the brilliant universe, our minds wanted to make sense of the colors, lights, and revolution of the sky. Myths abounded about running foxes, warring giants, and fireflies stuck up there. The biggest question was the simplest. Are we moving, or is the Universe? Our eyes couldn't tell.

Ancient Greek's had two big ideas. Aristotle said the Earth stood still. If it moved, why don't stars in the sky change position. Look at something far away, open and close one eye at a time. Notice how it moves. So why don't the stars move too? Aristarchus said the Sun is way bigger than the Earth, surely we must revolve around it, and the stars don't-look like-they move because they're extremely far away.

The best minds in the world choose the wrong answer. From Aristotle in 300 BC, to Issac Newton in 1600. The Sun revolved around the Earth. They believed it so much they said the Holy Bible even agreed. People used Plotemy's "epicycles" to explain the planet's movements and make navigation and weather pattern charts. They worked well enough, but since the premise was wrong they had to change the math every once and a while.

When Copernicus rediscovered Artistarchus, he thought maybe if the Earth revolved around the Sun, the math would make more sense. He tried it, and it did, although he kept assuming planets move in perfect circles so even his updated math wasn't perfect. He was so scared of insulting the ruling philosophy and its rulers he only publised his work on his deathbed. The powers that be didn't like questioning a huge pilar of science, religious, and political mythology. When Friar Bruno (your name sake) went from city to city proclaiming the Earth moved, the Universe had many worlds, and lots of other stuff, Darth Geocentric burned him alive. Let the others be warned.

Then Galileo made his telescope. It was a primitive telescope with hazy lenses made from hazy glass, but magnified our excellent 20/20 vision about 23 times. We were no longer primitive lifeforms with insufficient senses. Instead of merely telling the difference between up and down, day or night; we could now tell the difference between moving and not moving.

Many Sith lords tried to stop the new truth of new tools with a mountain of rules. Yet the people majically bonded anyway. They probed the environment and sensed the many errors inside the ruling philosophy, mainly the "nobles right to rule", that was enforced to keep the art loving and spectacle making, hierarchy alive. The classic story of tools solving real life problems won out like always.

With no tools like the telecope, microscope, spectro, and other scientific instruments, any and all human made rule books to explain the Universe in physics, biology, chemistry, botany fell down. With enough senses we probed the rule book called Nature.

Before digital tools, we may have had bacteria eyes to indicate light and dark, but we had no telescopes to probe for clear economic and political answers. We did our best with human made rule books and learned by trial and error in the dark. We searched for visions of the just and good society and did very well finding it at times with strong human virtues, but most of our battles was against Darth Blockbuster, not against Nature.

Digital tools are to politics and economics, what the telescope was to astronomy and physics. The Life Star isn't about bringing any heirarchies down, it's about bringing the frontline out of the dark.

- Evolution empowers life by giving every new lifeform a slightly different variation. With variations life can constantly test for environmental changes in things like water levels, temperature, and food supply. The variations unfit for the frontline die off. The fittest survive. This natural selection is how evolution finds which lifeforms best represent life on Earth.

## What Happens Next

If I could you what to think Stargazer, I'd say this to myself "I destined bring the Force to human evolution, by building the Life Star."

We don't know exactly what it is. Yet we have a great starting point. It's opposite. Light is the opposite of dark the same way full is the opposite of empty. Knowing one, defines the other. The Death Star is a rule book written humans. The Life Star is the opposite of the Death Star.

So what is it? The Life Star is a rule book no human can write. Rules can't be added, fudged, or abused, only uncovered. Happily, we already use this rule book. It's helped us truly understand our world in areas like chemistry, biology and physics. Of course I'm speaking about Nature; where scientists often feel the majic of discovering rules. Thus we replace human-made rule book, which Darth Blockbuster can so easily corrupt, with one that is uncorruptable.

The chemists, physists, doctors, and engineers who already use Nature often argue, and debate. They settle their differences much more often with tests of the uncorruptable rule book. Many happily think "failure is always an option", because while we can't add rules to Nature, we can strike off possibilities and thus get closer to an answer.

I'll explain how we use Nature to make the Life Star by asking you a question you can't answer. How old are you?

## The Life Star's First Brick

How old are you. Simple question solved by simple math. Start from your birth day and count how many times you've circled the Sun. It's a fact in all our laws, religions, and science. When we compare each other, objects, or thoughts, we use birthdays. That is how we tell time.

What if someone told you, like a witch or wizard, when you die. Would you still count the days past? Or would you start counting the days left? Wouldn't we live better if we knew our deathday? No more thinking we'll make up for wasted time "later". How many days in traffic, useless meetings, or stress inducing interviews are fueled with "later”? Later implies endless life, stories, and growth. Later is a lie. That's why no stories are about later. Because the stories worth telling happen now. To really live, we must realize our story ends.

If we want a great life, we need to know our deathday. Outside of an asteroid hitting the planet, a rare disease, or some other calamity, let's find it. In fact, we're inventing this tool to find it. We'll give you life by telling you when you die. How exciting! Better yet, you can control this tool; the more good choices you make, the better health you have, and the more life you buy.

Enter our first problem. We don't know what good choices are. Today we notice trends and point out "good choices" with diets, religions or ideologies. But there's a gap in knowledge for your specific life. Because your choices are not tailored for your genetics, diet, or circumstance. To give you more life, we must know much more about yours.

So, our new tool must track everything you eat and do. Only then can we empower you to buy better health and live a better life. We'll get to work. Once we're done making this new tool would you buy it? Maybe for someone's birthday?

Don't, because you already own it. So do you all your friends. Even your enemies. Your body is that tool. Your body tracks exactly what you do, and determines your health. Outside of calamity, your choices do determine how healthy you'll be and when you'll die.

So why don't we know more about our health? Why is our deathday and good choices such a mystery. The problem isn't our bodies. Nature did a great job. Our natural senses can't tell us our health because our prosperous economy made us independent of natural limitations. Prosperity gave us unfettered choices. Our natural senses can't read our biology fast enough to compensate. Smell, touch, taste, sight and sound are not good enough to warn of diabetes, cancer, or depression. Thus, it takes years for our unfettered choices to becomes problems big enough to notice with our biological tools. Today we compensate with medicine to reduce bad health and recommend better choices. We're getting better. Still each person doesn't know, at the point of decision, which choice is good or bad. So we live in ignorance and in bad health.

This is good news. Because the Life Star for health doesn't need to invent anything new. It only needs to detect what's already there by augmenting our natural senses with better cyborgology. We need to track what we eat and do, and regularly test our bodies. This way we can analyze which choices improve, or hurt, our health. Thus, we can buy more days, know our futures, and finally enjoy our stories.

What will happen when we invent the Life Star and see ourselves in a new light? Let's look at history. What happened when we invented the glass mirror? The modern mirror is a very advanced tool. It was made in the 14th century but not perfected and mass produced until the 19th century. Imagine what it was like seeing your physical self for the first time. No more guessing, no one else's opinion, no more using a polished piece of metal; only the truth. Today, mirrors show us a reality we all take for granted. A mirror empowers you to see your face, your technique, your youth, your wounds, your smile. Now we are inventing a new mirror. A new tool that similarly shows us the truth in real time. And what will happen when we see our psychological selves as if looking at a mirror?

We get a more accurate reality. Don't say it's impossible. Nature's infinite Universe dazzles us (whenever we look) to know impossible is nothing. The health version of the Life Star is a new psychological mirror that will change human decision making and taste and thereby solve our poor health with.

In fact, we already are. Fitbits, smartwatches, and genetic testing are just the beginning of the Life Star. We're well on the path to showing ourselves the consequences of our actions in real time. The Life Star's been in development for decades. Even if we didn't realize it, we'll soon see our psychological selves in a new mirror. No more polished pieces of metal, opinions, or guesses. Soon we'll see the truth.

The truth is we'll probably never know our deathday. But we'll get close. We'll see which choices give us vitality. The vitality to live a great story. Because knowing how many steps you took yesterday, tells you how many steps you could take today. And knowing how many total steps you've taken, roughly tells you how many days you have left to take them. The Life Star will show us, and everyone around us, our vitality. Our biological sense will get augmented. And after that, we'll be empowered to live like we're dying. We'll have the best of both worlds. We'll have a prosperous economy and the ability make good choices inside it. Because the truth of a mirror is too clear to ignore.

## More

That was just a creative way to say we don't know jack. And it's only with tools we learn anything.

Galileo's telescope changed the world. For centuries everyone thought the Earth was the center of the Universe. An ancient Greek genius named Aristarchus said we revolved around the Sun, he used a well, the tower of Alexandria, and the pytagoran theorum to correctly figure out the relative sizes of Earth, Moon, and Sun, and reasons why the humongous Sun would revolve around a tiny Earth.

But, with the naked it, it looks like it does. So, that's the answer the world put into the rule book. Copernicus used modern math to say maybe Aristarchus was right. Friar Bruno advocated "Copernicism" very publicly and was burned alive.

Galileo advoated just like Bruno did, except he said sorry when facing the antagonists. Under his breadth Galileo did stick it to him by saying "but it moves".

Most people know Galileo and not Bruno because of the former made a telescope. He literally saw the truth himself, and wrote books about what he saw. The telescope made new cyborgs who majically bonded with the new tool, and obsessively made it better and better.

The first image is always gritty. But it's still magical. This is what it looking through Galileo's telescope saw. This image led humanity away from human made rules, and into the one of Nature made rules. We're doing the same with our Life Star.

## We Don't Know Jack

We've lived under human made rules for centuries. Economic policy, political ideologies, product design, manufacturing, and marketing are all based on what we sense with only our biological tools.

We don't even know how old we are, or our probable death date. Ask a veterinarian bringing a abandoned dog back to health. She'll know its weight, height, blood work, exercise requirements, psycological profile, and tailor a meal, exercise, and socialization plan for it.

We decide our food by walking down an aisle and picking up a item for no more reason than Darth Vader is on it.

It's not our fault. Our cyborgology simply doesn't sense the better choice yet. Blaming the bad health choice is like blaming the dog for being abandoned. And if you have perfect health and thus think you can criticize, this is only one area whereby our human made rules ruin us. Ask yourself this.

How much money do you have, is not the same as asking how much money are you worth. Do you work to make a contribution to your economy, or your company. Are you naturally generous, or selfish. How often do you have psychological evaluations. What about blood work? How do you track your diet? Do you even think of your cyborgology? Do you understand the effects of walking to work versus driving in traffic? How often do you fly? How big is your own personal hole in the ozone layer? Do you buy American or foreign? Do you love the majic of teaching new tools, or the dark majic addiction to old ones?

That's only a fraction of what the Life Star will show us. Things get real interesting when we point the Life Star at our society.

How old are our roads. Should we rebuild them, or make internet faster and cheaper instead. What about our sewage system, what's it cost to maintain, rebuild, and are there better options. What about insurance, how much is spent on damages, verus administration.

The pay gap, does it exist, and if so specifically where, when, and with who. Who joins the military and volunteers, which populations, which persons, which cultures and religions contribute more often. What's the social trust between ethnicities. What effect does many different languages have on societies. Does white flight still exist, and if so when and who, specifically.

If you feel angsy asking these questions, you should. Remember Friar Bruno. He was burned alive just for saying human made rules would fall to Nature. But also remember Sophia. The majic of new tools, is stronger than the safety of using old ones. Digital tools will tell us these answers anyone.

Like with science, its the person who asks them first, who wins the power of knowing the natural truth.

## Stuttering ~~Helped~~ Teaches This Lesson

I already told you about my stutter. I'll use it again her to make a point. My first language was gibberish. No joke. Until grade 3 nobody had much idea what the heck I was talking about. Most people's speech dysfluency (saying "ah", "eh", "umm") is about 5% of their words. Mine was probably 80%. Come grade 3 my teacher and the school's special education teacher told my parents I needed an assessment to find out what was wrong.

I still remember that intelligence test. Among some pluses and minuses, speech therapy was recommended (and thankfully) paid for by the public school board. So I was a nine year old, being told by a psychologist, I had a problem with my genetics, and I needed therapy, grueling therapy at times, to fix my genetic problem.

Speech Therapy helped a lot. Specialists using techniques and tools to help me overcome my problem. My dysfluency got to about 80%. Still very noticeable at times, and still hard to live with, but I started using the phone. My first call was to a pet store asking if they had huskies.

This story illustrates life under the Life Star. I was lucky my problem was noticable by our biology. Even though the impediment is still a mystery, speech therapists really know how to help. Even when that jerk VP said I was an embarrassment, I knew the techniques to use again, to really beat the gremlin because of speech therapy.

Like inside any ecosystem, the more lifeforms there are, the faster the pain of the frontline is felt, adapted to, and solved. More lifeforms probe

Now, imagine people prone to depression, eating disorders, or stupid economic policies. Today these people only meet their specialist after suffering years of depression, being way over or under weight, or with needle marks in the arms. They suffer because they don't know themselves. And everyone's got a thing to work on, be it arrogance, self-pity, shyness, or whatever.

- protagonist always used the Nature rule book. They invent new tools to solve problems. Onec an only solve problems by assessing reality, not the imagined worlds of human made rules.

# Rousseau's Teachers

Rousseau told taught us alot. He explained what happens when a society lives inside spectacle and art, to hide from the fact the Sith have kept the divide between old societies and new ones artificially too wide. The nobility thinks they are divine, and tricks the people into believe it. Rousseau called bullshit, and with his philosophy made society function again.

Every great thinker builds on the work of others. Issac Newton linage goes on Kepler, Galieo, Copernicus, Aristarchus. Same for Rousseau. Here's where the idea's imbedded into his philosophy. We take note to be sure we include them each into the Life Star.

## Shoulder's of Giants

The first modern protagonist was Niccolo Machiavelli (1469-1527). He was born was poor, but his father got him many books from the recent printing press, and mixing a commoner upbriging with new tools, proved itself again to be a recipe for protagonism.

Printing press books were changing the world. Seemingly overnight, Europe was covered with books of all topics. The ruling philosophy was based on human created rules like nobles divinity and geo-centrism. Quick and easy knowledge let people find different answers, ones increasingly rooted in Nature. Darth King went to work defending his ruling philosophy with a host of rules.

Machiavelli read much Greek and Roman history and philosophy and soon realized humanity didn't need human created rules so much. Machiavelli foresaw a new ruling philosophy where humanity overcomes problems, by using human reason to build new tools. A human written rule book is a crutch, and now an especially unneeded crutch for a society with the printing press and scientific instruments. Humanity could master the many misfortunes of Nature with new tools.

If, Machiavelli said, humanity were to wise up, and ignored the "imagined world" of the human created rules, and judge human actions for their "effectual truth" on making the real-world better or not based on the problems on the frontline. He called this world new "modes and orders".

People answered the call for "effectual truth". They formalized the idea inside the scientific method. Which is the testing of Nature's to find its unbiased rules. Once telescopes, microscopes, and better mathematics were invented, a chorus of people used the scientific method in astronomy, chemistry, and biology.

![Effectual Truth Diagram](img\thewriter\triangle-the-matrix.png)

## Hobbes and Locke

The Scientific Revolution discovered many wondrous details of the universe. Things like the Earth revolves around the Sun, human anatomy, and the laws of motion. Scientists made using the human made rules the basis of all human thought look silly.

And it was in their tradition of questioning the natural world, that spawned the Age of Enlightenment (1687-1789). The Enlightenment was when humanity itself "wised up" by directing scientific questions to better understand not just physical nature, but human nature.

Now Thankfully, it wasn't long before dress wearing, banquest obsessed, cake eating, self-described divine nobles, were under the spotlight of effectual truth.

Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679), writing during the chaos of the English Civil Wars, started the long process to give Europe a new political ruling philosophy. He started it by defending an absolute monarchy, saying a super strong government is the cure against chaos. Hobbes said everyone should obey one king, who he called Leviathan, to avoid the anarchy that makes human life that is "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."

How Hobbes justified his nobility was monumental. Like Machiavelli, Hobbes disliked human created rules, so he didn't use the "divine right to rule". Instead, he said humanity is naturally, in our State of Nature, equal. The State of Nature is a place without government, where we're all equal because... well whose to say otherwise. Hobbes biggest proof of our equality is, without government, we can all kill each other with our ability to scheme, plot, and murder. So to keep everyone from killing each other, the people should forfeit their natural rights of equality to a Leviathan to ensure everyone's security.

Thus, _the King_ and _the People_, would have a social contract with each other. One based on equality, that ends in complete tyranny, but that guarantees everyone's security from the anarchy. This reasoning, believe it or not, started the liberalism that we have today. From constitutions, to the right to own property like race cars, and the right to control ones body with abortions, all guaranteed by the social contract between the people, and Leviathan, or what we call government. Guaranteed if these rights didn't threaten the country's all important security.

We'd recognize Leviathan better after reading John Locke (1632-1704). Locke says it's too idealistic to expect one person to be Leviathan. If power corrupts, then absolute power corrupts absolutely. Thus, Locks says its best to divide government's Leviathan powers up in executive, legisative, and judicial branches. Each would "check and balance" each other, to prevent a government that's worst than the anarchy it's supposed to get rid of.

Locke's philosophy is behind our written constitutions, bills of rights, elected governments, citizens right to bear arms, checks and balances between executives, elected legislatures, lawful judges, freedom of speech, and freedom of religion. Mass printed books, guns, scientific instruments and many others, were enshrined by Locke into society's ruling philosphy, via constitutions. Most people today live under Locke's Leviathan.

Rousseau (1712-1778) liked, but disagreed with, Locke and Hobbes. Yes, humanity is naturally equal, but said humanity is only murderous in a society. If a thinker goes back farther into human nature and history, they'd find happy-go-luck hunter gatherers who weren't filled with the envy, jealously, or anxiety of modern humans living under unnatural ruling philosophies. This is where Rousseau's philosophy, "Man is born free; but everywhere he is in chains" that we discussed earlier came from. Rousseau says yes society needs a social contract, but one that harnesses the natural goodness of humanity.

Rousseau thus keeps Hobbes' social contract, but wants to create a new person to live inside it. Rousseau's Leviathan is not concentrated into a single person, or even a checked and balanced government, but is distributed throughout society via direct democracy. Meaning there are no representatives of government inside a nobility, or a elected representatives. Instead, all people who live under the all powerful Leviathan, also control the Leviathan.

To have this new society, requires a totally "new person". Someone who can give responsible commands to society, while accepting the rules society gives back.

Once Locke and Rousseau's ideas spread, democratic nation states emerged from the feudal kingdoms. The number of wars declined, because once the extras fighting the wars on the battlefield ruled their society, they didn't want more wars than absolutely necessary. Empowering the people breeds collaboration not competition.

We can see this best in our militaries. The armies of kingdoms were loyal to their king. Kings only answered to themselves. Thus, their militaries weren't often volunteers, but conscripts and paid mercenaries. They often looted and pillaged to make their money.

However, the armies of George Washington and other democracies were different. They were fighting not for a human made rule, but for Nature. Understanding nature empowers everyone. Thus, democractic soldiers don't need to loot and pillage and swear loyalty to any other man. They fight for liberty.

These are the lessons of Rousseau. We must uncover the effectual truth, to discard our imagined world, and make a new reality embedded with Nature's lessons. This, means we're all naturally equal, and must live inside a social order with checks and balances, with the freedom of speech. Ideally its best to make each person responsible for their actions inside this Leviathan of a society.

As it happens, what Machiavelli to Rousseau were talking about is making ecosystems. And that's what we need to do for ourselves. Once we do, the rest will fall into place.

# Human Ecosystems

Around March 2011, Donald Trump and his family were guests on The Oprah Winfrey Show. He and his family were answering questions and giving their views on modern culture and politics. It was just before President Obama's re-election. I imagine Trump was testing the waters to see if he should enter the 2012 election.

During the internew Trump said something along the lines of "In South Korea, we have thousands of troops, and I ask, why aren't they paying us for this?"

This one question was all I needed to hear. Whenever he decided to run, Donald Trump would be President. The frontline would hear a rational question. The heirarchy would hear an irrational one. All he had to do was keep up this "irrational rationality" and he'd win.

The reason is also the same one why we can't save the polar bears by sending them to the Amazon, or even to Antartica. Species, and cyborgs, need their own ecosystems.

## Polar Bears in the Amazon

If you were to see camels in Norway, tree frogs in Mongolia, or polar bears in the Amazon you'd automatically see something wrong. Not with the lifeform, we take our kids to visit these cuties in the zoo, but you'd see an obivous mix-match of a lifeform in a foreign ecosystem.

Now when you see SUV’s in Shanghai, daily newspapers in England, American McMansions, coal power-plants in the Sunshine State, and another Spider Man playing throughout the world, you wouldn't see the same mix-match. Even though England has few paper mills, China no oil fields, Florida no coal, or Americans having no desire build and clean their own mansions. You wouldn't see the same mix-match between lifeform/adaptation and it's ecosystem, because you wouldn't see foriegn lifeforms because you wouldn't see different ecosystems, as you automatically do with a polar bear in the Amazon.

When Europe entered the Renaissance and Scientific Revolution, the ruling nobility hit the jackpot. The society's they controlled developed new tools that made them the strongest in the worlds Ships that could travel against the wind, navigate at night, and rule the seas. Guns that could kill from hundreds of yards away. Books that could educate about the best military tactics, navigation, and agriculture methods. The nobles used this power to spread themselves, as they spent the 1500-1900 colonizing the world with their rules.

Yet, these political empires didn't last. And there was nothing that could have made them last. The reason is a simple one. The rules, and way of life of England, France, Spain, is not the way of life that will prosper somewhere else. Nature adapts lifefotms to local problems inside ecosystems. Humans evolve with tools. Thus, we need ecosystems to adapt. World wide rules and empires are like trying to have little biodiversity.

It's impossible. A dream. The European nobility fought to keep it alive for centuries. They fought the wave of independece to local governments could make their own rules, customized for their own political ecosystems.

And now, our world-wide mass produced, free-trade, global rules that sustain the pre-digital tools of suburban housing, blockbuster movies, gas cars, fasionabe clothing are merely the same thing Darth King's political empires. Economic empires of Darth Blockbuster trying to have his economic cake and eat it too.

Darth Blockbuster is trying to make polar bears live in the Amazon. And the extras are stuck using the wrong tools to solve the frontline problems.

## The Buffet Line

Okay Skywalker, so I said to ignore red / blue philosophies. But I'll indulge this one here for your and mine sake. What I just told you, that the world economy has to divide into mostly self-suffcient ecosystems isn't simple. It'll eventually happen, I mean cyborgs from Nova Scotia and Jordan need different tools to prosper for the same reasons their natural lifeforms have different tools to prosper. Their enviornments are totally different. And if the same political laws didn't work in both ex-British empire places, why should the same tools for transportation, agriculture, education, entertainment and so forth.

But this simple observation will cause a huge backlash from Darth Blockbuster and blue / red politics. The ideology of one tool fights all is their meal ticket. The business side wants to sell their tools in every ecosystem, so fights for one world of economy. The cultural side wants to integrate the world's people, and so fights for one world culture. A single world economy is a team effort. And it pays well. And so they'll fight back.

The argument will be basically this. That mass producing tools, even if they aren't customized for a ecosystem, is more efficient. That it's better to have lots of generic foxes, then less customized artic or desert ones. Pre digital tools that might have been true, but with 3D printing, cheap computing, easy knowledge, digital tools, it's simply not. It's better to make whatever tool best solves a frontline problem.

Mountains of think tank policy papers, corporate future plans, consultant forecasts, will say otherwise. Movies, cars, homes, fuel, manufacturing should all be mass produced. Because this generates wealth for everyone to enjoy. International bankers, lawyers, executives at G8 meetings, Davos, Aspen, and others will talk about how world economy products enough to give a buffet of wealth for everyone.

To defeat the attacks, and they will simply attack and not argue, ask for their place in the buffet. So sure, no problem mister 500 dollar an hour lawyer, I'll stick with you, just can we switch wages. I'll write a regulation for climate change action, and you can do technical customer support, with stagnate wages and a boss who keeps threatening to outsource me if I don't work weekends for free.

They of course won't. They'll say they earned their place. And that reveals their identity. They believed in a heirarchy, and they earned their high place in it by following the rules. They want to University and said the right things. They joined an international corporation, and followed the rules, and said the write things. And you didn't. They rose about the frontline and deserve to be rewarded.

But Techvolution is about frontline people solving frontline problems with digital tools. No heirachries, just problem solving. So when you are confronted by the heirarchy wanting you to be a polar bear in the Amazon, just ask them to switch spots.

I don't know everything in life. I don't know much at all. But I do know you'll always still be here. And that should tell you all you need to know.

- without an economic ecosystem, we're individuals trying to win at a team game, and being blamed for our troubles.
- our cyborgology. We see our ever expanding toolboxes, but not the expanded ecosystem of cyborgs it empowers.
- The march of civilization needed an answer. Thus, needed an protagonist to find one. The antagonists would yell about the rules. Social, ethical, economic, political, anything they could use in the spectacle of cable news, newspapers, bureaucarcies, people with the titles of a heirarchy defending their power from an logical question.

# Game of No Restarts

Nobles refuse to play evolution. In any game, the start resets after each contest. That happens when new tools are invented, but is rejected by the player who thinks he's gold medals are a birthright to his noble blood.

If a lie of omission is a lie, then lied to you a while back. In the evolution of cyborgs chapter, I told you evolution lives inside all lifeforms, making variations to constantly probe for environmental changes. This is how life adapts.

However not all lifeforms create variations. Because not all lifeforms have sex to procreate. Some clone themselves instead, called asexual reproduction. Some water fleas, scorpions, aphids, bees, even some fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds don't mate. Instead the femals fertilize their own eggs with their own genes.

Researchers are still studying asexual reproduction, but cloning helps lifeforms grow faster. Every individual can mother children. There's no competition for mates. No mating rituals. Just reproduction. It's very efficient.

But there's a reason why only 1 in 10,000 lifeforms reproduce asexually. Because there's no variations, any problem in one individual, like a disease or defect, exists in all individuals. Thus asexual lifeforms tend to explode, but then die off relatively quickly.

These lifeforms don't adapt. And we can see our fate, in their's. Because when we don't embrace new tools, we depend on old tools. We similarly clone them, and spread them throughout the world, and enjoy the good times of easy mass reproduction, until a fault brings the entire system down.

# The Rationality of Irrationality, and Walking on Eggshells

- outsiders have perspection.
- society needs genetic outsiders, who can't accept the rules, because they're irrational
- when society is irrational, individual irrationality is a chance to right the ship.

## The Rationality of Irrationality

The Sun used to rotate the Earth. Every birthday party was a celebration the Sun revolved around you. The Earth was stationary, and the stars, galaxies, and Universe that surround our little solar system was basically a lightshow. That's all we could see with our eyes.

Ancent Greek astronomer and mathematician Aristarchus of Samos (310-230 BC) said otherwise. Among his achivements he correctly figured out the relative sizes of the Moon, Sun, and Earth. Every year a well in Egypt had no shadow. He reasoned the Sun is directly above it. On the same day he measured the shadow the great Tower of Alexandria. He measured the distances and heights of everything, used the pythgorean theorem, and voila, the Sun is 80 times the size of Earth, and the Moon is one forth. Aristarchus thereafter said why would the Sun move if it's so much bigger.

Aristarchus was right, but his argument still lost. If the Earth moved so much, Aristarchus had to explain why the stars don't move positions. He said the stars were other Suns, but just extremely far away. Extremely far away seemed too weird when humanity measued things in feet. So Aristarchus lost out to Aristotle's opinion the Earth was stationary, and the Sun revolved around it.

Most everyone in all cultures and religions agreed. It's a mark of Ancient Greece genius that it thought of both options, made astronmical systems for both, and choose Aristotle because his evidence seemed better. And it wasn't until Issac Newton in 1687 finally settled the debate. Until 1687 it was rational to be wrong.

Thus, when Copernicus rediscovered Aristarchus during the Renaissance around 1514, he started thinking irrationally. It was around the same time Machiavelli told Europe to disregard tradition and find the "effectual truth". Modernity, the line of reasoning from Machiavelli to Rousseau, started by being irrational. Thus even though Copernicus finished a early copy of _On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres_ in 1532, he didn't want to publish it because he feared the scorn "to which he would expose himself on account of the novelty and incomprehensibility of his theses".

Contrary to some opinions, the religiously minded scholars of Europe, going through the wars between Catholics and Protestants, were not immediately hostile to Copernicus. Many were curious. Copernicus had a reputation for intelligence. When he said the Earth moved people were curious. It was fine to even talk about it, and even argue about it. As previously discussed, Europe was just obessesed about preventing political collapse, because even centuries after Rome's collapse, they feared the chaos. So people just couldn't say the Earth moved was the truth. Truth only has one definition, and two definitions starts political collapse.

Copernicus's book was almost pure math. Most people, regardless of social status, couldn't understand it. Thus they were extras in the story of whether the Earth moved or not. The backlash started when rogues brought Copernicus's message to the extras. Because the rationality of the ruling philosophy was questioned. Until Newton, any argument for Earth moving was irrational. Thus, the rogue's had to make irrationality arguments about the truth. The best example of the rationality of irrationality was Friar Bruno (1548-1600).

Bruno's life could fill volumes. He was a protagonist in every sense of the word. He rose above the ruling philosophy of Aristotle and Christian theology. Born in 1548 he became a priest in 1572 and studied theology in a monastary, getting his doctrate in 1575. He was investigated for having controversial theological views (more extremely minor details like thinking Jesus was a being separate from God). He was persecuted and frustrated enough to flee his monastic order in 1576. He was excommunicated and spent the next 16 years travelling western Europe.

Bruno was poor. He worked at a printer, he taught Latin, and did what he needed to make the rent. He taught in University for a few years before Protestants kicked him out. He was a known rebel to everyone still obessesed with the ruling philosophy. That's probably why all three major western religions, Catholics, Calvinsits, and Lutherans, all excommunicated him. Today that would be like the USA, China, and Russia all hating you.

If you met Bruno you'd know why was so hated. He was irrational. That's why he could understand the truth better than almost everyone else. Even more then Copernicus, Bruno imagined the Universe for what it is today. Other stars, with other planets, with other lifeforms. Millions and millions of miles away from Earth. The rational people simply couldn't understand this imagination.

Ever talk to a homeless man? Not the one whose job was outsourced, the the drifter, or the one on drugs. The quiet guy who walks around talking to himself, too obsessed with his own thinking to do much of anything else. He's homeless, but a perfectly nice person content with his own thinking.

So walks around inside the reality only he knows. He loves when anyone agrees with him, but almost nobody can because he can't even describe it. He's perfectly happy inside his own reality.

Until you take him out of that reality. Until you tell him that reality isn't real. That in fact he's living a lie. That he should change. Then you'll see the nice man become a guardian and defend his reality like a parent defending a child. No moderation is possible. Stubborn, asshole, foolish, crazy, many names label that homeless man. It's best to leave the man alone, let him be, and let him live inside his own world.

If you've ever talked to someone like that, if that sounds familiar, then you've talked to Friar Bruno. The difference is Bruno didn't have a unique reality he was happy to live within. He had a unqiue reality he demanded others live in. The Earth moved damn it! The Sun was the center of the Universe! Listen up!

That's why Bruno's life wasn't spent walking around Naples, minding his own business, as another forgotten homeless man. It was spent writing, lecturing, debating everyone and everything in all of western civilization. He pissed off everyone because Bruno argued for the rationality of irrationality.

Because Bruno was a bit off, he could disassociate with the human world, and see the truth modern technology made possible. Bruno had a stream of realizations, a stream of majic in his head. He struggled to explain the rationality to anyone else, because well, it wasn't rational yet.

He was the tip of the spear. The one who bore the burden of being the first to cross the dangerous river. His free mind, which makes many men homeless, made him point to the future. He was rewarded with publications and fame, and punished with scorn and infamy. He never gave up. Many people were his antagonists. Occasionally regular people with their stubborn beliefs, but usually it was high ranking clergy and political leaders who attacked him, usually with dialogue in spoken threats or written condemnations. He was finally burned at the stake.

Bruno story is the same as Socrates, Rousseau, Hobbes, Machiavelli, Copernicus, and so many other protagonists. All of whom questioned the ruling philosophy, threatned the ruling nobility, and pushed the human race forward. They all show the rationality of irrationality. which is otherwise called wonder. And wonder is the tool of the extra. Because anyone can wonder, and once anyone wonders, they open themselves up to new answers.

And today, the extras need to wonder what they see, and will see, in the telescope of digital technology. The lesson is the same for our telescope. The one that will showcase the errors in our ruling philosophy of liberal free-market economics. It will showcase details about our economics that so far are irrational to mention. But who is responsible for climate change? Which individuals fly the most, drive the most, consume the most, that our fucking planet is boiling. Who over claims on insurance. Which communities, which persons take more than they contribute. Who resists accountability that the telescope will reveal to us.

The telescope will show us we need economic ecosystems. We need to create communities, with a strict divide between members and non-members, to force everyone to collaborate to use local resources much more efficiently. We need to create technology, to showecase the effectual truth of all the world's cultures and peoples, in order to give individuals the economic freedom they have in politics.  We must be camels living in the desert, and anacondas in the Amazon.

The self-declared smart will probably never get techvolution. For the same reason why few accepted Copernicus, Bruno, Machiavelli, and the rest. Changing the ruling philosophy makes them stop attending banquets and balls celebrating their nobility and instead get back to work.

The extras in the story of society are the only ones free enough to make themselves into the futures protagonists. And today's extras are the struggling middle class. And the question is, will they. They certainly should. But we only find out if they will in the story's climax.

## Galileo

![The Galean Moons](/img\ch4\side-by-side_med_hr.png)
_We now call them Galileo's moons._

That little, hazy image, did more than any battle could. It upturned a ruling philosophy, because the ruling philosophy thought it was above the technology that created it. This wasn't suppoed to be possible. Although we've learned technological development will always usurp society's ruling philosohy.

And don't laugh. We aren't much better. Because what's the image that's going to change your ruling philosophy. It's out there somewhere, waiting for somebody to take look. And we don't even know what it looks like. Because we aren't even wondering what it is.

Here's a hint. From Aristotle to Galileo, the world's people's thought the world revolved around them physically. Look through the human created world of mythology you live in today. This time your ancient beliefs are not the Universe revolves around you physically. This time the truth is the Universe does not revolve around you mentally. In the first stage of modernity space, mathematics, medicine, all of nature was the topic of wonder and discovery; now you are. All your choices, desires, impulses, preferences, tastes, opinions, habits, obessesions, endulgences, fears, disorders, illnesses, actions, and addictions, catered to by ruling philospohy of red / blue in politics and economics now have to be held up to the test of seeing the truth for ourselves.

So the plot of life is already there. We already live it. We just can't sense it. Like Galileo's telescope, once we augment our senses, we can sense better and see a better truth.

The question is how will society's mirror look like? Well like most things, we can trust in Sean Bean. Because the first mass printed book was a porno. The first telescope was toy. The first gun was a novelty. And the first glimpse of using digital technology to track the plot of life, the grandstory and your microstory, is in computer games. Spend a few minutes and listen to Sean Bean explain how society's work.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yKUFvo3_FYQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

_Civilization_ like games are called city builders and real-time strategy games. There are one's where you build a city like _SimCity_ or _Anno 1800_. In these games you start with a village and your goal is to plan and allocate resources as best you can to keep your city alive and prosperous. Your enemy is nature and your own mismanagement. There are some games like _Age of Empires_, _Total War_, and _Civilization_, which are similar, except you build a civilization and war with other nations for survival.

When we see society from the top down, all at once, and every story is tracked, our understanding greatly increases. We can judge, understand, take in. Every aspect, from leaders to workers, sanitation to armies, are important. Did you notice, there is no Darth Blockbuster saying no.

Building a better civilization It's what life is doing with us. And now because of digital technology, we can see how it real time, inside our own lives, not just in a computer game.

## Components of Civilization

Do you see our lessons narrated by Sean Bean. These games make players "god", a "player god" who runs every detail of society and decides things like where to build cities, who to attack, when to upgrade to electric cars, and what religion to enforce.

Your watching a society's cyborgology.

What we call life, God, the gods, or magic, is a real thing. In reality, every society has a "player god" who is responsible for running things. There's a long to-do list. Things like getting fresh water, food, and building material. Building waste dumps, roads, and powerlines. Funding research and development. Erecting defenses and attacking others. All these requirements are among many of society's functions - established operations to provide what society and its individuals need. It's the player god's responsibility to manage them well.

In history the player god has been tribal mythologies, the Greek pantheon, Christian theology, or constitutions and free-markets. Each has always professed to be the same thing, the best player god to make society happy. How does society give itself a player god, and how are decisions decided by the player god are pivotal questions, one's that we'll answer in this book. It's easier to understand these grand questions by using computer games, because in the game, your the player god.

The second lesson from computer games, is learning the one limitation to being god; philosophy. Philosophy is a society's "organizing principle" or its "ruling philosophy". How the commands of the player god are implemented by real-life people.

The third lesson is technology trees. Technology has stages of progression based on their functonal contribution to society. Functions are the established operations of a society. Protection, shelter, learning, repopulation, building, and sanitation are examples. Functions are made real with technology. As technology changes, how the function happens does as well. So for example, the first tools to protect ourselves were our own fists. According to the technology tree of protection, we started with clubs, which became spears, bronze swords, steel swords, bows and arrows, flintlock guns, now rifles, and soon lasers.

Deciding on the mixture of functions is what the player god does. These games are perfect to learn from because it's expected civilization will transform as they go through technological ages. There's no surprises, no special interest like oil companies resisting electric cars or managers resiting telecommuting, because transitions are going to happen. The job of the player god is to manage them.

## That's It

Hopefully that was simple. Hopefully, life's grand story, a society's ruling philosophy, and individual microstories, were all right there, easy to see. The stories of protagonists, vs antagonists, aren't there, but, hopefully you can see where your microstory fits into our real life game of _Civilization_.

There's nothing complicated about seeing a better version of the truth. Like seeing Jupiter's moons, it's supposed to be simple.

We can all see the potential of digital technology. In our misson to empower proactive revolutions with techvolution, we now see society from the top down; like we're looking at it through a lens. Although we often complain about the horrible trends in our society like debt, or climate change, we can now see who is going right, and who is doing wrong, for us, inside our plot of life.

Just think of Google Maps, and it showing you live feeds of traffic, weather, and restaurant reviews. Wait we have those of course. See, I'm not bullshitting you. We already are inside digital _Civilization_. So keep adding stuff! What's the by-laws for opening up a restaurant? Click on the map, and tell the player god you want to open a restaurant, and let digital technology make it a afternon of work, not months of paperwork.

Keep going. New digital modes and orders are so amazing. What happens when the player god notices social capital is low, and so requests a microstory to open up a new bar in a neighborhood. Fuck the free-market, fuck centralized planning, we have digital technology telling us what the Universe looks like, and so we can fulfuill the requirements.

You're future is inside this video. We master our plot. We master our technological development. We rid the world of revolutions. And look forward to techvolution. We have so much potential. Colonies on Mars. Curing cancer. Stopping climate change. Knowing when human life begins. And so much more possible, once we overcome the antagonists.

Antagonist depend on the abstractions

### Taken from Technology trees

The tranistions are huge, and something we need to appreciate in real life a lot better. As society transitions, every building, road, tool, system of government, instantly upgrades to the possibilities of new technology. Moving into the bronze age turns thatched homes into brick buildings, spears into swords, and oral history into written books. Giving humanity a technology road map will help us transition our societys much more easily.

Every new technology and function develop the same way. In its infancy it requires manual labour to make use of. Like clubs and spears. As technology develops it gets stronger, like with swords and bow and arrows. Soon technology gets so strong it requires little human mastery, like guns and soon lasers. The first steps are the growth phase of a function, where humanity fills in for weakness with its own mastery of swordsmanship for example. As technology progresses, it frees humanity from having to master old techologies. Swords were expensive to own, and took years to master. Guns are cheap, and can be learned in a few days.

The growth phase, requires humanity to concentrate together around the limited technology. Not everyone can own master hand to hand combat, or an expensive sword and shield and are thus dependent on the few who can. Yet as technology advances, it moves into the distribution phase, where human mastery is less needed, and thus more people can control their own protection because guns are cheap and can be leared in a few days. Growth and concentration, then distribution and democratization is the pathway to all functions in society.

### Why Are We Unhappy

All of this is supposed to be done by our ruling philosophy. It's not working. We need the freedom to choose what works best in our tools, and our politics.

# Mixed Ideological Politics

## Voting For a Hamburger

Most of us have ordered a meal at a restaurant. We don't sit much of it. We sit down and joke with friends while looking over the options and eventually saying "hamburger with fries" to the waitress Amanda. She writes down the order, smiles, and walks away.

While we wait we talk with friends, joke with our spouse, help our kids draw on napkins. We're free to do whatever because we're not invovlved in making our meal. In 20-30 minutes Amanda returns, serves the food, and says "enjoy".

Ordering meals is simple. And it's how we should exercise our vote.

Here's why. At a restaurant you enter with a problem. You look over the options and put an expert in charge to come back with something that solves your problem. The success or failure of the people in charge is entirely dependent on the thing they bring you. And you evaluate the thing with your own senses. Meaning the burger and fries is either good or bad based on your own touch, taste, and smell.

If you do sense a problem you simply say "Hey Amanda, something's wrong".

You don't use yours, or anyone elses, intuition. You actually smell the burger and tell Amanda; "smells off doesn't it?", and because you're using a common sense, Amanda can now smell the object and test it herself.

If Amanda responds "well our cook used the proper cooking techniques, so it's not our fault. It must be the supply company, go talk to them."

Would you ever say "okay, well you did your best, I still support red/blue restaurant!"

Of course not. Yet, in politics, when our problems go unsolved our politicians respond like that. They say "well I followed red philosophy so it must be something else... blue, it must be blue's fault!"

Seems ridicules, yet the struggling middle class has accepted this excuse since the 1970's. Politicians use it, not because they don't care, but because they follow old philosophies obsessed with keeping people from majically bonding with digital tools. Turning the middle class struggling with endless traffic, mountains of laws, increasing cost of living into the proverbial polar bear trying to live in the Amazon.

It hurts politicians as much as anyone. Spend time with councilors, state senators, or mayors and you'll find out listening struggling polar bear's is a hard day. Sadly, without a new philosophy letting the polar bear adapt with new tools, red/blue can only blame each other (with increasing hatred) for their philosophies shared outdatedness.

I'll explain how we can fix this by getting in your corner during a fight.

## Martial Arts

Humans have many different martial arts. Whether it be boxing, kickboxing, judo, karate, tak-won-do, jiu-jitsu, or wrestling. Each teaches its students to fight and win; yet has a set of rules in which to compete. Boxing only allows punches. Kickboxing doesn't let you hit a downed opponet. Tak-won-do is mainly kicking with no take-downs. Judo is take-downs with no kicking. Jiu-jitsu is trying to choke someone, while wrestling is trying to pin them down.

Only using a few tools, like kicks, or throws, mimicks species when they fight each other. For example, male sheep will ram each other all day but will never attack a sleeping opponent. Likewise each martial art uses the same human body to defeat another. Yet each has a long list of rules limiting the ways they can use that body.

Howevever, other than fights within species, Nature has no rule book but letting the fittest survive by any means neccesary. Living in nature is a no holds bared lifestyle.

Filled with rule books for fights "within species", martial arts eventually wanted to find out which system was the best. Their answer also tell us how to solve our political debates.

## Mixed Martial Arts

Many people we're searching for the best martial art at the same time. In the 1990's the search created organizations like Vale Tudo, Pancrase, and the Ultimate Fighting Championship.

Despite ardent believers vouching for their own favorite martial art as being the best, the faces of beaten and bloody combatants inside dozens of no-holds barred tournamets gave a surprising yet logical answer. The best martial art was throw away all the rule books, and mix them all together. Rules for rules sake was quickly seen to be a Death Star to one's physical health.

That realization was the birth of the new sport called Mixed Martial Arts (MMA). In MMA there are few rules (basically no biting, eye pokes, or low blows). Fighters are free to do almost anything to win. Punches, knees, submissions, clinches, holds, chokes, locks, slams, throws, taunts, work rate, kicks, cart wheels, whatever. Seems funny upon reflection, but despite hundreds of years of martial arts, before the 1990's, nobody ever thought to mix all these techniques together.

So, MMA fighters win by choosing which technique to use based on the immediate problem their facing. Like in Nature, the fighter who adapts the fastest wins. Thus, MMA fighters heavily believe in accepting responsibility for their actions is a good thing, encapsulated in the often used mantra "submit and learn".

Importantly, each martial art is still excellent in its own realm. They specialize in submissions or punches, and thereby teach MMA fighters skills no generalists could ever learn themselves. What MMA fighters do is take these specialized skills and mix them all together into their own style. Evolution in MMA is thus very fast. Its fighters are constantly trying to keep up.

Most martial arts like boxing and judo accept their limitations and now seek to master their speciality. Sadly, a few reject the lessons of MMA entirely. A YouTube search for "Akido master versis MMA fighter" shows what happens when this fantasy meets reality.

The lesson here is rule books can help to master a speciality. Yet, when it comes down to it, Nature, whether on the Savanah, or on the streets, gives us no rules. Whatever wins is the effectual truth.

The ultimate lesson is something more specific. MMA teaches us why it okay to expect our politicians to get our orders right. They should use Mixed Ideological Politics.

## Mixed Ideological Politics

Political ideologies, whether red, blue, purple, or green, are the same as martial arts. They're rule books meant to solve specific problems in a unique way.

Each of today's ideologies has advantages and disavantages. Neo-cons, liberals, socialists, greens, social conservatives, low-tax liberals. I'm not going to debate the strengths and weaknesses in them here. The point is there is a debate. No ideology is self-sufficient.

Yet today they act like they are. Every ideology has a plan for climate change, government debt reduction, healthcare reform, modernizing education, getting rid of traffic, airport renewal and so on. But our problems keeping piling up because politicians judge themselves according to their own rule book, not the effectual truth of improving life on the frontline.

Many voters are already willing to vote for different ideologies. Politicians are not. Unwiling to do whatever it takes to get results, they stay loyal to their ideology rather than admit, all ideologes have virtues and drawbacks.

That's what keeps red/blue philosophies from adapting to digital tools. Like a aging sitcom, they've moved into the self-importance and are unwilling to change, and use the spectacle of high-paced news coverages, big loud speeches, and grandstanding with the controls of government at their hands to distract the extras from their continued failure.

And this refusal to care more about winning thr fight on the frontline is causing the middle class to get the shit kick out of us.

## Beaten Bloody Extras

Fighters have coaches and advisers giving them advice before and during a fight. They're called cornermen because they sit at a fighters corner when they're in the ring.

Now, imagine what would happen if a old-school karate coach put a student into a MMA fight and told the student to only using karate technique. The poor kid would get his ass kicked.

As the MMA fighter was wrestling, and choking the poot kid, the karate coach would yell at the referee "He's cheating! He's breaking the rules!"

When the fight was finally over, and the karate kid is bleeding all over himself, the coach would start yelling "the system is corrupt, this is all bullshit, you did everything properly. I did everything properly. We're the winners!".

Seems silly, but that's what politicians and political partisans do today. Red/blue are just coaches using different ideological rule books who refuse to mix in new ideas as needed to solve whatever problem they're orderd to solve.

And we the people are in the ring, on the frontline, getting our asses kicked. Some are misguided enough to believe red or blue is good enough on its own. Most people try switching their their vote between red and blue hoping for some help.

None comes. Because we don't have Mixed Ideological Politics. Yet we do with a ruling philosophy of Techvolution. Because with Techvolution the definition of political success is not ideological purity, but solving problems on the frontline with tools to fight whatever problem troubles us.

We get Techvolution by electing representatives who want to be protagonists. People who can realize they didn't get our vote, they got our order. Whether its the right to repair our own electronics, easing regulations on small business, or stop incompentent bosses giving themselves raises paid for by unpaid overtime. We need tools, actual tools we can hold in our hand like apps, repair equipment, and worker controlled time-sheets, to solve these problems.

That doesn't mean we should order everything on the menu. But either the representative helps make a tool to solve our problem, or can point to someone who has, or they don't. They're free to use whatever means neccesary. But blaming "the other side" for breaking the rules makes no more sense then a waitress blaming the supply truck for a raw hamburger, or the karate kid saying a MMA fighter cheated.

The question is, like smelling our food, or feeling an ass kicking, what common sense can we use to judge the results of the tools Techvolution gives us.

## Techvolution in Your Corner

Just like Nature lets lifeforms adapt however they need to, so should we.

We'll build it in the next book.

That means we all must be protagonsits, solving problems....the story is more important than the characters. The fight is more important then the coach or his rule book. Life is more important than any life form.

We either tap and learn, or we become antagonist citing a rule book history wont care about anymore than life cares about all the lifeforms gone extinct before we showed up...

Techvolution is about expanding the people's toolbox by letting them use whatever tool best solves their problem. We should demand our politics uses whatever playbook needed to get us there.

How to make red/blue agree. The Life Star, use a common sense. Senses....

In 1948, the Surpeme Court brokered a deal between the movie studio's and the justice department. The "paramount consent decrees" was an agreement banning studio's from owning movie theatres, or coordinating with them on pricing and product.

Movie theatres were the only screen in town. They showed all news, documentaries, public service accouncements, and stories. The studios owned about 10% of theatres, and gave themselves the best movies. This gave them control over all video distribution, which the government thought unfair, hence the paramount decrees. Of course in 1948 television was invented, a new tool that did everything the new rule was supposed to.

But the rule still stuck. Even till today. It's against the rules for the movie industry to have Apple stores, or even be like HBO and Netflix. After 1948, the movie industry made movies hoping the independent theatres would agree to show it. You can see why the studio's loved "directly selling" DVD's to their customers when the chance came.

Before 1948, he movie industry had a "studio system". It can be called "the genius of the system" because they consistently made classic stories that had enough surprises, and logic, that most anyone could enjoy them, much like Netflix today.

Working with the paramount restrictions in the 1950's and 1960's was tough. However the industry was still operated by classic storytellers who still made good stories with stars like, John Wayne, Elizabeth Taylor, James Dean.

However, come the 1970's movie theatres were almost dead. They needed to attract customers, but were not allowed to lower prices, or create popular series. They tried 3D movies, but like that last attempt it was a fade. So what happened was art and spectacle. Here's what John Wayne said about it in 1973.

> All the real motion picture people have always made family pictures. But the downbeats and the so-called intelligentsia got in when the government stupidly split up the production companies and the theaters. The old giants like Mayer, Thalberg, even Harry Cohn, despite the fact that personally I couldn't stand him—were good for this industry. Now the goddamned stock manipulators have taken over. They don't know a goddamned thing about making movies. They make something dirty, and it makes money, and they say, 'Jesus, let's make one a little dirtier, maybe it'll make more money.' And now even the bankers are getting their noses into it.

The bankers did. When Jaws, Star Wars, Indiana Jones were massive hits, they said, give me more of that. What else could anyone do. Making classic stories requires taking chance to see what works, and that requires showing movies to audience. Takng these chances is not allowed per the rules.

* That hole, make classic stories and see which stick, was antithetical to Darth Blockbuster's expectations on returns. He'd prefer to buy up, use up, and move out.

So, here we are today, watching the same blockbuster stories, but with more effects, and spectacle each time, so hopefully we wont notice the stories kinda suck. Studio's keep making them, because they can tell theatres. Studio executives are no longer classic storytellers, but agents and dealmakers fighting to control the rights to our 1970's culture.

And as they made ever more spectacle movies, the movie industry compensated by making ever more art films. These from Sundance, Cannes, Toronto, Tribeca and whereever else they like holding parties and panels. Films that get weirder and weirder, where the hero talks about themselves and doesn't solve regular problems.

That's why movies are so expenseive. Movie studio's want their production money back. So they sign deals giving them 90% of ticket revenne on the first weekend. 80% on the second and so forth. That's why they market movies like crazy, to get people in when the studio's get the money.

The theatres thus fight for revenue with popcorn price higher than sushi.

A movie industry forced to make spectacle and art films because a rule in 1948. How many more rules are out there holding us back?

Good stories versus bad stories. When I was a projectionist I (and any other) could tell the difference without ever seeing the movie. We just watched the audience's reactions. If they scream, cry, laugh, yell, it's a good story. Even more telling was listening to moviegoers walk out. If they marvelled about twists, turns, and cool lines, you know the story was really good because it turned fiction into reality.

The audience is never wrong. They can't be. Laughing, being surprised, remembering cool lines is not audience's job. They're jobs is only to watch. It's the storytellers job to give its audience emotions and memories.

## Open Source

The key concept to open source is that the rules are open. Everyone who uses Chrome, can go and see what the code says. Very few people know what to look for, but by opening up to everyone, we don't give anyone the power to decide who is doing the looking.

When I asked a movie theatres reporter about ending the paramount decrees, so that cheaper movies could charge lower prices to compete with blockbuster movies, here's the response i got.

Your question about the possibility of studios once again having a controlling hand in the exhibition sector is one that has come up from time to time, and as you know from your research, that form of ownership is largely prohibited because of the 1948 ruling by the Supreme Court.  And, as you also know, the decision was based on the notion that vertical integration under the old Hollywood studio system was in violation of antitrust laws.  That notion is still widely accepted and is the reason why production/distribution houses and movie theaters remain separate businesses.

Your argument that vertical integration would actually improve competition (in terms of product with lower budgets being given a more level playing field, so to speak) is an interesting one, but the industry is highly unlikely to return to that model for many reasons.  Having covered the exhibition side, I would say that theater operators feel that production houses/distributors already have too much say in where product is unfurled (it's sort of an open secret that studios strike more favorable deals with theater chains that have more desirable sites in terms of markets and neighborhoods within those markets, etc.).  Exhibitors have also argued for years that producers/distributors fare far better in terms of admissions because of standard box office splits (believed to be as high as 90%/distribs to 10%/exhibs on opening weekend), so ceding any more power to the other side is, to put it mildly, a longshot.

The movies got super popular being a affordable, and dependable, night out. People dressed nicely to go the the theatres. There was live entertainment, pre-shows, drinks, and socializing. People waited in line with anticipation. Much like Apple Stores today.

Whether or not the movie's should re-open up their own stores is an open question. The fact they we customers, other than the very few guys with an interest, should be ale to see the rules isn't. The only thing keeping the paramount rules on the book, is the public doesn't realize how much it changes their econonmy.

The Life Star would tell us. Every rule written would have a rationale, and it would be connected to teh industry in which it governs, just like aline of computer code. And everyone could see what rule the effect is having with experiments, not a belief system.

# Field of Battle

## Introduction to War

Life fights for antifragility.  For eons and epochs, through the variations of lifeforms, life evolved to get it.  At every step life adds antifragility by making each successive lifeform more able to harvest resources independent of its circumstances.  This lead to humanity, a conscious being inside an adaptable body.  Our consciouness lets us realize new realities and create technology to evolve life faster.  Humanity's civilizations are built around their own unique technological variations.  Each civilization is a species unto itself.

Historically, this means civilzations must fight for their lives.  As in the quantum world there are no definite laws for winners and losers in daily life.  Each action is a chance, with odds of success forthcoming.  Although there is a definte trend.  Civilizations that add antifragility eventually win.

## WHY DO WE FIGHT

Once upon a time western Europe was very Irish, or Gauls as they were called back then.  Gauls were native in moderen Ireland, England, Scotland, Wales, Spain, France, Switzerland, Belgium, Holland, Germany, and Nortern Italy.  Between 600 BC to 80 BC they dominated.  They even sacked Rome in 400 BC.  Unopposed, Gauls were free to live their semi nomadic way of life.  Organized into tribes, Gauls lived in wood huts, had basic agriculture, some iron tools, and druids "reading the stars" to tell fellow Gauls what to believe.

By 84, few Gaulic tribes were free.  Among them were the Caledonians; who eeked out a living on the northern tip of Britain.  Most of the other tribes had submitted, been defeated, or enslaved by Rome.  Rome had risen from a small city in central Italy and conquered.  Rome made the people's of the known world, including Gauls, provinces of its Empire.

The Roman general Agricola wanted the crumbs; he wanted Caledonia.  The Caledonians would be like anyone else.  Agricola offered terms of surrender and assimalation.  That didn't work.  Then he tried to force a decisive battle, instead the free Gauls kept running away.  So Rome burned their grain silos.  Submit to Rome, starve to death, or fight.  Rome didn't care which.  The Caledonians choose to fight.  They followed their leader Calgacus.  Calgacus assembled his people, forged a free army, exhaled for his people to defend themselves against Roman subjugation and slavery.  Live free or die!

Tens of thousands of Caledonians fought.  The "freefolk" of Game of Thrones fame would be proud.  They're probably based on the Caledonians.  Both peoples lived a semi-civilized life.  Some technology and government to ease the surpises of nature, but still very individually free from oppressive rules and customs.  Free to think, move, live as they wanted.  Few regulations beyond revered custom, individuality and self-sufficiency.  Towns assembled with natural elements, houses, and food taken from nature.  Caledonia had an army of individuals who used stout courage to defend their way of life.  

What did Rome have?  Rules and regulations everywhere.  Their roads had regulations, their towns had regulations, their army was aghast in regulations.  Their government was bureacratic and complex.  Individual lives were regulated into servitude.  Rome had a professional army of auxiliaries, legionaries, infantry, calvary, forts, supply lines, artillery, armour, archers, supreme engineering, organization and training, and the determination to expand their community's way of life.

In 84, the two sides fought on a plain in Caledonia.  Both sides declaring "Live Free or Die!".  Both sides thinking they would win.  Both thinking they should win because their civilization was the best way to live.

## WHAT IS A FIGHT

What does a fight mean?  What does it mean for one group of humans, to do battle against another group of humans.  Why do we fight?

Let's start with the "fight" part.  The fight part is the swords, bullets, blood and guts.  Fun and exciting to watch in a movie maybe.  But we're not interested in the spectacle.

We're also not interested in compromise.  If two sides can compromise there really wasn't much dividing them.  Or a deal delays the inevitable conflict like when North and South in America compromised around slavery until their civil war.  Here we're concentrating on human advancement, thus to fight means to expand your way of life at the expense of another because there is a dividing question, like owning a person, that requires an answer.  Conflict needs a conclusion.

We're interested in human advancement, so we're much more curious in the "what" of what does a fight mean.  "What" asks a question, and thus gives an opportunity for consciousness.  "What" is the dividing question between two warring parts.  What is the trend of all the correct answers in history?  You'll see these questions embraced in micro, in Mixed Martial Arts.

MMA mimics nature.  Unlike boxing, karate, or tak-won-do, which has many man-made rules and safety nets, in MMA, there are very few outside rules (basically no weapons, eye gouching, or groin strikes).  In MMA persons are free to do almost anything to win.  Punches, knees, submissions, clinches, holds, chokes, locks, throws, taunts, insults, work rate, kicks.  Mixing these martial techiques is the art with variations nearing infinity.  No one can master it all.  Persons have to learn fast.  Persons have to keep learning.  Thus "submit and learn" is a strongly believed mantra to MMA fighters.  MMA fighters ask "what" as often as they can.  They cross train every other discipline like boxing or jiu-jitsu to try and gain an advantage, all the while concentrating on mixing it all together into their own fighting variation.  The sport of MMA has changed so much in just a few years because the main source of success is asking "what" instead of concentrating on "fight".  This is why MMA fighters will defeat any other kind of fighter.  They adapt faster.

To fight MMA is the ability to be honest and reflective.  To realize the strengths and weaknesses of yourself and your circumstances.  The more often a person asks what, the more likely they are to win a fight.  This applies to person-to-person combat in MMA.  And it applies to civlization to civilzation war as well.  The micro-lessons of MMA are easeir to see as we look into humanity's larger scale wars.

However, our civilizations don't start off by fighting each other.  We first have to make a civilization which is to say we have to fight nature.  What's the best way to harvest water?  What's the best way to build shelter?  What's the best way to get food?  What's the best way to explain the stars?  We battle nature anytime we encounter it and ask "what".  As individuals gather together to fight nature, they form a civilization.

The second battle is between civilizations.  What government makes more sense.  What religion makes more sense?  What diplomacy makes sense?  What's the best way to decide who leads and who follows?  What tactics make more sense?  What allies make more sense?  What enemies make more sense?  What gender roles make more sense?  The first battle is a individual asking what to nature, the second battle is asking what civilization defend or expand themselves.

How do we fight nature and each other.  Human will power is not magical.  It needs instruments.  The natural instruments are our basic tools.  Eyes, hears, hands, feet, the human body lets us interact with the natural world.  Mixing the body, with a human mind asking "what" means humans can invent technology to expand their abilities.  Speech, heliogriphcis, writing, alphabet, clay tablets, scrolls, ink, paper, printing press, books, radio, movies, television, internet, ebooks, audiobooks, is just one line of technology that continually improves human abilities.  Technology is anything we use to interact with the world.  But there is soul inside technology.

Technology is a relfection of human consciousness.  It is the human mind, at the moment it sees a new reality, that asks "what", and creates a new way to interact with the world.  Thus the technology a person, or civlization has, is the visible manifestation of the consciouness of both.

All of this happens within our psyche.  It's where all the battles actually happen.  As the slew of questions arise from nature, society, and ourselves, there are so many contradictions our psyche becomes a world of quantum physics.  When do we prioritize ourselves, or our community?  When do we discard old technology for a new one?  When do we war, or compromise?  When do we adopt or leave a religion?  So many questions can be maddedning, and most people defer to the group.  

There are many fields of human understanding.  Psychology, geography, sociology, economics, history, all of them can offer insights.  They may even determinist in their insights.  However, nothing but politics controls society's rewards and punishments on the daily basis.  Politics makes people hate, kill, march, enlist, sacrifice, argue, debate, fight each and every day.  Politics is the framework for a person making decisions inside a civilization.  Since politics decides good and bad, rewards and punishments, politics gives the psyche a framework to make decisions the individual and group will understand.  

Politics is a filter for a civilizations psyche.  In the real time strategy game a civilizations political characteristics determine its civilization as being advanced,  practicle, religious, militaristic, resourceful, diplomatic, etc.  Moreover, the player by making their choices for their civlization is making political choice of making war, diplomacy, city-building, colonizing, upgrading the technology tree and so on.  Politics is the prison we live in.

So how do we change our politics in the real world?  By asking "what" about our politics.  Like any good MMA fighter, we are also free to reverse our situation by asking "what" and make a realization.  The moment when you see a new reality and work to create a new technology to take advantage of the new reality.  Anyone else is free to see the reality.  However like the Fourth Dimension, you cannot show it to them.  It's a different consciousness.  This consciousness is the nature of political philosphy.  And here we arrive at the actual battlefield.  For political philsosophy is the supreme disciplines of all battles.  The divide is the same as for MMA.  Where like boxing, or karate, are a place filled with artificial rules and safety-nets, and MMA closing mimics reality by stripping rules and concentrating on new levels of consciousness.  Political philosophy unlike psychology, history, economics, theology, or other disciplines with rules and safety nets where the only rule is to question rules by asking "what".  Thus to understand all human battles, we have to study political philosophy.

And what are we fighting for?  In any battle, no one fights for less resources. Family, faith, ideology, are all fought for and against, yet in no battle ever, has anyone fought to get less resources.  Why we fight, is to fight to earn, keep, or increase our personal and our community's social surplus.  Social surplus is the real world manifestation of anti-fragility.

## WE FIGHT FOR THE SOCIAL SURPLUS

The social surplus, the ability for a civilzation to harvest more resources than it consumes.  The supreme marker of success.  The destination where the foot tracks lead.  The truth that judges every civilization.  No civilization every existed that said it would make a social deficit for its members.

Every battle we fight, is fought to increase our social surplus.  We battle nature to harvest a social surplus via hunting, gathering, and farming.  We battle each other over natural or human resources to increase or protect our social surplus.  We battle ourselves to increase and not squander our surplus.  At each battle a civilization is tested, if it wins enough it earns surplus.

Where does surplus come from?  Civilizations get surplus when it acts with foresight.  An example is the marshmellow test.  Eat one marshmellow now, or get two later on.  This question tests someone's ability to delay gratification.  The more foresight they can have today, the more marshmellow's they'll have in surplus tomorrow.  The more surplus gives even more freedom to keep investing in the future.  It's cyclical forwards and backwards.  You'll see this in yourself, your friends, and in civilzations.  Planning for tomorrow always gives a better today.

Technology is the manifestation of a civilization's politics.  American politics had open debate and freedom of expression, so it made the internet, an electroinc information sharing network that couldn't be controlled because it was distributed into nodes with no central authority.  The Soviet Union would never make that.  The rich United States spent millions on a space pen, the more pratical, and poorer Soviet Union used a pencil.  American military technology was very advanced but hard to maintain, while Soviet technology was good enough but easy to maintain.  The link between technology and politic is so strong America defeated the Soviet Union without firing a shot.  The USA simply used technological containment; developing opposing technology to attack the Soviet Union's political philosphy and not trading with them to artificially sustain their failing way of life.  A real world fight was useless.  The technology of freedom brought such a social surplus that the technology of control toppled.  Soviet military couldn't keep up with advanced USA military technology and made a  fight seem frutile.  Soviet society realized it's harsh daily living circumstance was needless when VHS tales of full American super markets, and lavesh housing spread showcasing the benefits of capitalism.  By it's ability to control perceptions of good and bad, in all the fields of battle, politics controls the problems a civilization encounters and therefore the technology it makes.

As we progress through different articles, humanity's eternal battle for social surplus wont be spoken about all the time.  Yet it should always be in the readers mind, because it's always in your mind too.  Being sated makes it easy to forget how being cold, hungry and unsafe controls your actions.  Even when spoiled we unconciously fear losing our protection.  Because we get out of the life that is nasty, brutish, and short when we continually find ways to harvest more resources then we consume.  Earning, and keeping a social surplus is why we fight nature, each other and ourselves.  But because we're caught inside a unique adapation, we can't always see outside our civilization.  Political philosophy can show us by reaching into the heavens, looking into the infinity of the forms, thinking of good and bad, and looking into our adaption and asking "what".

## LIVE FREE OR DIE

We come back to the quantum world and the events of humanity and the battle between Caledonians and Romans.  The two sides fought.  Blade on blade, flesh on flesh, and the battle of Mons Graupius in 84 was very predictably another Roman victory. You can picture the opening scene to "Gladiator" to get the gist. Barbarians vs Romans and Roma Victa! was yelled yet again over-top mounds of barbarian bodies.

Rome came, saw, and conquered.  Rome, it's army, and it's civilization, was unstoppable.  Because what did Rome have?  The benefits of an advanced civilization.  It produced better armor and weapons, it's fighters were very trained and disciplined, it's engineers were ingenious and could make forts, towns, roads, bridges, aquaducts, wagons, and seige weapons as needed.  It's leaders were schooled in tactics, philosophy, ethics, and history.  It's towns had fresh water and steady food, and it's people demanded victories in exchange for their regulated lives.  Rome simply organized resources, human and natural, more efficiently than Caledonians.  That's why Rome defeated Etruscans, Carthaginians, Gauls, Germans, Greeks, Britons, Egyptians, and countless other peoples.  We know nothing of Caledonians perspective; they weren't even literate.  The battle was lost before it was fought.

The Caledonians fought for their way of life.  To live free or die.  Yet within a few hours of combat they became a fleeing mob.  Their army broke, they're entire civilization fled.  Collectively they were more willing to die than submit, but individually were more willing to flee than actually die.  There were still enough Caledonians to smother the Romans, but all their order was gone. Caledonians, like many peoples, didn't have the collective order to enforce individuals to act in concert the way a civlization must if it wants to do anything useful.  In contrast Rome had the foresight to train their soldiers.  They were professional, extremely discplined, and followed orders.  Thus Roman armies had various units, specialized in various jobs like archery, slingshots, catapults, bridgbuilding, fort building, heavy and light infrantry.  All of these were equivalent to a military orchastra capable of such cohesive action individuals strength was increased exponentially.  One of many reasons Rome was free to keeping expanding.

Back to the battle, Romans kept killing till night fell.  By the time the sun came up, an awful silence had settled everywhere. The hills were deserted, houses were smoking in the distance, and Roman scouts met no one.  Calgacus had been right: Rome had made a wasteland and called it peace.

Winter was coming. With his enemies broken and his army stretched thin, Agricola left the Caledonians to their suffering and led his troops back toward their bases in southern Britain.

The farther south Agricola marched, deeper into territory Rome had held for decades, the less it looked like a wasteland. There were no burned-out ruins, no starving refugees; rather, the Roman army saw well-tended fields, bustling towns, and merchants eager to sell to them.  Prosperous farmers were drinking Italian wine from fine imported cups, and Britain's formerly wild warlords had exchanged their hillforts for luxurious villas. They sported togas over their tattoos and sent their sons to learn Latin.

Here was a seeming paradox that might have troubled Calgacus, had he been had he been alive to see it, or if he had the history to understand it, or better yet if he was self-ware enough to realize "maybe I should be conquered?". Because to most Gauls on the Roman side of the frontier the explanation for why the Roman Empire was not a wasteland was obvious. The orator Marcus Tullius Cicero put it best a century and a half earlier, in a letter to his brother Quintus, who was then governing the wealthy Greek province of Asia (roughly the western quarter of modern Turkey). This was an excellent posting, but Quintus had temper problems, and the provincials under him had been complaining.

After a few pages of stern elder-sibling advice, Marcus's tone changed. The fault, he concluded, was not all on Quintus's side. The Greeks needed to face facts. "Let Asia think on this," he pointed out. "Were she not under our government, there's no calamity of foreign war and civil strife that she'd escape. And since there's no way to provide government without taxes, Asia should be happy to purchase perpetual peace at the price of a few of her products." This was in fact already true.  Pre-Roman ancient Greece, split up and divided amongst various and often warring city-states like Athens, Sparta, and Thebes, was always under threat.  And although the battles of Marathon, Salamis, Thermopylae are exciting to read, the need for herioic victoires against foreigners stopped forever once Rome took over.  The Greeks, prone to huge in-fighting, also stopped warring each other too.  Even as Alexander the Great destroyed Persia, the Greeks still warred among their kingdoms.  However, under Rome, Greece was free to prosper.  And prosper it did for hundreds of years as it consistently earned a social surplus.

The story is the same across all civilizations.  The more Rome, or Qing China, or the British Empire expanded, those inside had safer, more properous lives.  The field of battle was consistently won by the more advanced civilizations, advanced by their ability to make a social surplus.

## WHAT WOULD YOU FIGHT TO BECOME

To be civilzated or not.  Is being subjucated to a government better than to be free from one?  Is the life of a noble savage better than a educated citizen?  Is living in a dream of individual freedom that the Caledonians wanted better then living in a wonderland of regulated prosperity inside Rome?  Who is better, Calgacus or Cicero?

The answer is as simple as looking at the human migration tracks.  Few people ever left Cicero to go to Calgacus.  Many fought and dreamed for the chance to be a Roman citizen.  Agricola himself was a Gaul; romanized after his descendents lost to Rome's expansion.  There is indeed lots to learn from defeated civilizations; different perspectives on humanity, the reasons for their decline and fall, holistic living, individual freedom, folk tales, however longevity isn't one of them.  And if a way of life can't sustain itself, regardless of the reason, then why prefer a extinct way of life to a longer lasting one.

Civilizations that spread themselves are superior.  It proved more able to harvest resources, organize itself more efficienty, educate itself, study nature, attract and keep people happy, and spread itself.  Roma Victor, or Rule Britannia, or Manifest Destiny, it doesn't matter.  Civilizations compete, make war, winners expand, and create larger civilizations.  The larger the civilization the more peace and security those inside have.  Security brings internal peace, commerce, trade, and wealth.  Roman success is called "Pax Romana".  Qing China is called "Pax Sinica", our success was the "American Dream".

So why did the cold, hungry, poor Caledonians fight to keep their way of life?  Why was barbarism worth suffereing over if most of their British cousins to the south were happily Romanized?  Why is realizing problems, and adapting to a superior way of life, so unusual for a civilization to do?

## WHAT IS NATURE'S TAP AND LEARN

When do we get realization; the ability to ask "what" during our daily battles.  Hitting rock bottom is often a opportunity.  Yet Caledonia didn't change.  After Agricola left Caledonia in ruins, he never returned.  The Caledonias got lucky, but didn't change their way of life and were soon lost to history.  Rome didn't fare too much better.  The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire is the longest history book ever and there's still no answer what western Rome could have done differently.  (Most observers blame the pacifying effect of Christianity's concern for the after life.  Other just say Romans were tired of fighting others and themselves and wished for the afterlife.).  Rock bottom is an opportunity to reflect most civilizations don't take.

Some losers are fortunate enough to lose to someone who sticks around and forces "unconditional surrender".  These enlightened winners reduce the excuses of losers and make them learn from their faults by copying the winners.  Most Gauls, Ancient Greece, The Confederate States of American, Nazi Germany, the Japanese Empire all fell to "unconditional surrender" and were soon after more prosperous then their own civilizations thought possible; and far better off then other civilizations who lost but kept thinking they were undefeated.  But most winners only pillage and don't care enough to force adaptation.  

## WHAT IS TECHVOLUTION

We should know several things by now.  Depending on nature's rock bottom is taking a chance.  Same for hoping a winner will be an wise educator.  What if civilizations could ever adapt themselves.  Like a lot of great fighters, what if civilizations were honest enough to hit realization.  What if they could reflect honestly about their circumstance.  They could ask questions from the equality of the forms; the place of infinity where any and all things are possible, and think which technological variations are best to try in the uncertainty of our daily lives to increase anti-fragility.  Social surplus is the reality of success for our technology.  Imagine the marshmellows if we could have so much foresight.  Thus the ideal civilization belittle ourselves, our religions, and ideologies to see reality.

And now we come to this books essence.  We are not making a contribution to the art of war, international diplomacy, history, MMA, science, sociology, antropology, psychology, or even political philosphy.  We're giving summaries of all to help us understand our question.  How does technology transform civilization and give birth to a new one?  What happens when all the fields of battle are within Rome's psyche?  What happens when Calgacus and Cicero, Caldedonains and Romans, call themselves members to the same civilization?

Civilizations decline and fall once a social surplus becomes a social deficit.  Once peaceful, prosperous Romans are forced to rethink the social contract they individually struck with their community, they soon demand Cicero either makes good on his promise or leave.  Cicero often resists being a Calgulus and fights back.  Who is who?  Unlike the battle against nature, or an external enemy, there is no easy way to determine good and bad within a civilization.  There is no civil engineering or astronomy as there is for the battle with nature, there is no diplomacy or art of war as there is for external wars.  The individual can't look to the masses for guidance, if the masses are divided.

Once a society's internal political process fails there is no framework to understand the resulting internal battle.  Today we call the process of societal implosion "revolution".  A homage to Copernicus' On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres (1543), which undercut so much political mythology by arguing the Earth revolved the Sun, that people started to see Calgulas when looking at their royal leaders in early Modern Europe.  Thereafter "revolution" became a political term in the English, French, American, Russian and following Revolutions.

Revolution is romantisized today.  We use it to talk about changes like "The Digital Revolution" and a "Comedy Revolution".  Real revolutions means a societial failure.  They shouldn't be bragged about.  They happen because new technology shows humanity new realities.  The old guard fights off attempts to supersede it.  Real revolutions are bloody horrors.  They should be avoided.  After centuries of Revolutions I think history gives us enough lessons to update our civilization without internal implosions.

To update our civilization means to implement new technology.  We don't fight over old technology.  We argue at the border of new technology.  We argue at the medium whereby new technology restarts society.  The old technology's concentration and accompanying love of social exclusivity is debased by new technologies distribution and love of equality.  Techvolution achieves that transition without implosion.

The battleground is resources.  A society in social deficit nears revolution.  A society in social deficit needs techvolution. Many people today get their daily bread by filling in paperwork.  Actual paperwork in a time of massive computer advancements makes no sense.  Like Caledonia, or the Soviet Union, not updated your technology is not safe, just ignorant to history.  Having a job within a society on social deficit is useless.  So how to integrate artificial intelligence system that automatically analysis reports, and gets rid of millions of jobs?  This is a question today but it doesn't need to be.

This book is called Techvolution because we can update ourselves now.  We can see how technology is seeing through our society, showcasing it's imperfections, and leading us towards a new civilization that exists technologically, but hasn't been actualized yet.  We need to invent it fast.  And we can; if the tech industry gets their head out of the marshmellow of contemporary success and stop distrupting the past and actually invent the future with technology that brings social surplus to the masses again, we can avoid the turmoil history shows us will burst out into revolutions if we do nothing as we fall further into social deficit.  We can start the future now.  We can increase antifragility now.

Techvolution is conscious evolution.

Techvolution is proactive revolution.
