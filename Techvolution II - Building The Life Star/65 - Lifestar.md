_We now call them Galileo's moons._

That little, hazy image, did more than any battle could. It upturned a ruling philosophy, because the ruling philosophy thought it was above the technology that created it. This wasn't suppoed to be possible. Although we've learned technological development will always usurp society's ruling philosohy.

And don't laugh. We aren't much better. Because what's the image that's going to change your ruling philosophy. It's out there somewhere, waiting for somebody to take look. And we don't even know what it looks like. Because we aren't even wondering what it is.

Here's a hint. From Aristotle to Galileo, the world's people's thought the world revolved around them physically. Look through the human created world of mythology you live in today. This time your ancient beliefs are not the Universe revolves around you physically. This time the truth is the Universe does not revolve around you mentally. In the first stage of modernity space, mathematics, medicine, all of nature was the topic of wonder and discovery; now you are. All your choices, desires, impulses, preferences, tastes, opinions, habits, obessesions, endulgences, fears, disorders, illnesses, actions, and addictions, catered to by ruling philospohy of red / blue in politics and economics now have to be held up to the test of seeing the truth for ourselves.

So the plot of life is already there. We already live it. We just can't sense it. Like Galileo's telescope, once we augment our senses, we can sense better and see a better truth.

The question is how will society's mirror look like? Well like most things, we can trust in Sean Bean. Because the first mass printed book was a porno. The first telescope was toy. The first gun was a novelty. And the first glimpse of using digital technology to track the plot of life, the grandstory and your microstory, is in computer games. Spend a few minutes and listen to Sean Bean explain how society's work.

_Civilization_ like games are called city builders and real-time strategy games. There are one's where you build a city like _SimCity_ or _Anno 1800_. In these games you start with a village and your goal is to plan and allocate resources as best you can to keep your city alive and prosperous. Your enemy is nature and your own mismanagement. There are some games like _Age of Empires_, _Total War_, and _Civilization_, which are similar, except you build a civilization and war with other nations for survival.

When we see society from the top down, all at once, and every story is tracked, our understanding greatly increases. We can judge, understand, take in. Every aspect, from leaders to workers, sanitation to armies, are important. Did you notice, there is no Darth Blockbuster saying no.

Building a better civilization It's what life is doing with us. And now because of digital technology, we can see how it real time, inside our own lives, not just in a computer game.

## Components of Civilization

Do you see our lessons narrated by Sean Bean. These games make players "god", a "player god" who runs every detail of society and decides things like where to build cities, who to attack, when to upgrade to electric cars, and what religion to enforce.

Your watching a society's cyborgology.

What we call life, God, the gods, or magic, is a real thing. In reality, every society has a "player god" who is responsible for running things. There's a long to-do list. Things like getting fresh water, food, and building material. Building waste dumps, roads, and powerlines. Funding research and development. Erecting defenses and attacking others. All these requirements are among many of society's functions - established operations to provide what society and its individuals need. It's the player god's responsibility to manage them well.

In history the player god has been tribal mythologies, the Greek pantheon, Christian theology, or constitutions and free-markets. Each has always professed to be the same thing, the best player god to make society happy. How does society give itself a player god, and how are decisions decided by the player god are pivotal questions, one's that we'll answer in this book. It's easier to understand these grand questions by using computer games, because in the game, your the player god.

The second lesson from computer games, is learning the one limitation to being god; philosophy. Philosophy is a society's "organizing principle" or its "ruling philosophy". How the commands of the player god are implemented by real-life people.

The third lesson is technology trees. Technology has stages of progression based on their functonal contribution to society. Functions are the established operations of a society. Protection, shelter, learning, repopulation, building, and sanitation are examples. Functions are made real with technology. As technology changes, how the function happens does as well. So for example, the first tools to protect ourselves were our own fists. According to the technology tree of protection, we started with clubs, which became spears, bronze swords, steel swords, bows and arrows, flintlock guns, now rifles, and soon lasers.

Deciding on the mixture of functions is what the player god does. These games are perfect to learn from because it's expected civilization will transform as they go through technological ages. There's no surprises, no special interest like oil companies resisting electric cars or managers resiting telecommuting, because transitions are going to happen. The job of the player god is to manage them.

## That's It

Hopefully that was simple. Hopefully, life's grand story, a society's ruling philosophy, and individual microstories, were all right there, easy to see. The stories of protagonists, vs antagonists, aren't there, but, hopefully you can see where your microstory fits into our real life game of _Civilization_.

There's nothing complicated about seeing a better version of the truth. Like seeing Jupiter's moons, it's supposed to be simple.

We can all see the potential of digital technology. In our misson to empower proactive revolutions with techvolution, we now see society from the top down; like we're looking at it through a lens. Although we often complain about the horrible trends in our society like debt, or climate change, we can now see who is going right, and who is doing wrong, for us, inside our plot of life.

Just think of Google Maps, and it showing you live feeds of traffic, weather, and restaurant reviews. Wait we have those of course. See, I'm not bullshitting you. We already are inside digital _Civilization_. So keep adding stuff! What's the by-laws for opening up a restaurant? Click on the map, and tell the player god you want to open a restaurant, and let digital technology make it a afternon of work, not months of paperwork.

Keep going. New digital modes and orders are so amazing. What happens when the player god notices social capital is low, and so requests a microstory to open up a new bar in a neighborhood. Fuck the free-market, fuck centralized planning, we have digital technology telling us what the Universe looks like, and so we can fulfuill the requirements.

You're future is inside this video. We master our plot. We master our technological development. We rid the world of revolutions. And look forward to techvolution. We have so much potential. Colonies on Mars. Curing cancer. Stopping climate change. Knowing when human life begins. And so much more possible, once we overcome the antagonists.

Antagonist depend on the abstractions

### Taken from Technology trees

The tranistions are huge, and something we need to appreciate in real life a lot better. As society transitions, every building, road, tool, system of government, instantly upgrades to the possibilities of new technology. Moving into the bronze age turns thatched homes into brick buildings, spears into swords, and oral history into written books. Giving humanity a technology road map will help us transition our societys much more easily.

Every new technology and function develop the same way. In its infancy it requires manual labour to make use of. Like clubs and spears. As technology develops it gets stronger, like with swords and bow and arrows. Soon technology gets so strong it requires little human mastery, like guns and soon lasers. The first steps are the growth phase of a function, where humanity fills in for weakness with its own mastery of swordsmanship for example. As technology progresses, it frees humanity from having to master old techologies. Swords were expensive to own, and took years to master. Guns are cheap, and can be learned in a few days.

The growth phase, requires humanity to concentrate together around the limited technology. Not everyone can own master hand to hand combat, or an expensive sword and shield and are thus dependent on the few who can. Yet as technology advances, it moves into the distribution phase, where human mastery is less needed, and thus more people can control their own protection because guns are cheap and can be leared in a few days. Growth and concentration, then distribution and democratization is the pathway to all functions in society.

### Why Are We Unhappy

All of this is supposed to be done by our ruling philosophy. It's not working. We need the freedom to choose what works best in our tools, and our politics.
