# MIXED MARTIAL POLITICS

## Voting For a Hamburger

I'm going to make a complex political point in a simple way. We've all ordered a meal at a restaurant. It's simple. We look over the options, think it over, and say "hamburger with fries". The waitress writes it down, and you wait.

While you wait you read a book, listen to music, talk with your friends, joke with your spouse, watch your kids draw on the napkins. You're free to do whatever you want. Because while your meal is being made, you have no involvement whatsoever.

In 20-30 minutes the waitress Amanda returns, serves and the food, smiles and says "enjoy". You and you're friends are happy and chow down.

Ordering a meal is how you should think of voting.

You sit down with a problem. You make your choice. The people you put in charge, come back with an object that solves your problem.

Tge success or failure of the people in charge is entirely dependent on the object they bring you. And you determine any problems by your senses. If the burger is raw, or the fries are mushy, or the mayo is foul, you touch, taste, or smell the object and say "Hey Amanda, something's wrong".

When Amanda comes, you tell her the problem and expect it to be re-solved, because that's what the object was supposed to do; solve a problem.

Now, what if Amanda she were to say "well our cook used the proper cooking techniques, so it's not our fault. It must be the supply company."

Would you ever say "okay, well you did your best, I still support red/blue restaurant!"

Of course not. Yet, we think of voting this way. Not because the politicians don't care, spend time with them and you'll see first hand they do care and it's not an easy job. It's the old philosophies we all follow causing us to fight. I'll explain it best by getting into your corner in a MMA fight.

## Martial Arts

Lifeforms fight each other. Resources are limited, and whichever lifeforms get them first win. So, they fight to be first. Fighting gives resource efficiency, which fuels more lifeforms to live, gives life more biodiversity to probe for environmental changes.

Fighting is how lifeforms cooperate. After all, they're _forms_ of life. We lifeforms are merely life's minions to find the best form to represent life in the current environment. To do that, we need to probe the environment and those who can harvest resources the best, that means we cooperate together by fighting each other, for natural selection.

MMA fighters call this idea "iron sharpens iron". Because fighting, in competition or in practice, is simply cooperating to both get better.

Species agree how to fight each other. Most obviously seen during mating season. Males fight with whatever weapon they share, like horns, paws, or heads. They don't act outside this agreed dueling method. It's there instict. A smaller male lion doesn't attack the bigger one at night, and effectively murder the competition.

This agreement explains how human combat systems like boxing, kickboxing, judo, karate, tak-won-do, jiu-jitsu, and wrestling. Each is fighting to win, yet has a set of rules in which to play. Boxing is punches only. Kickboxing doesn't let you hit a downed opponet. Tak-won-do is mainly kicking with no take-downs. Judo is take-downs with no punching. Jiu-jitsu is trying to submission someone, wrestling is trying to man handle them.

Each martial art uses the same human body to defeat an opponent. Yet each has a long list of rules fighters agree on. This is kind of like species, who also agree that the winner males gets to mate, or the oldest female runs the group.

However, between species in the wild there is no rule book. Each is trying to sharpen each other's species, thus all (fake) rules are off. Natural selection rules, only the fittest survive.

In the early 1990's, someone had the idea to throw away the rule book in marital arts. They wanted to fight between "species" without any rule books. This started the current sport of Mixed Martial Arts.

## Mixed Martial Arts

MMA started by accident. People were curious which martial art was the best. They were several different companies out there. Vale Tudo in Brazil. Pancrase in Japan, but the biggest was the Ultimate Fighting Championship in American.

After several years of no-holds barred, people found the answer for the best martial arts. Mixed. The answer was to throw away the rule book.

In MMA, there are very few outside rules (basically no weapons, eye gouching, or groin strikes). Fighters are free to do almost anything to win. Punches, knees, submissions, clinches, holds, chokes, locks, throws, taunts, insults, work rate, kicks. Choosing which technique is best, depends on the environment (i.e. the opponent) and the problems at any given moment.

Thus, "submit and learn" is a strongly believed mantra to MMA fighters. MMA fighters cross train every discipline like boxing and jiu-jitsu, all the while concentrating on mixing it all together into their own fighting variation. The sport of MMA has changed so much in just a few years because the main source of success is asking what works best. This is why today, MMA fighters will defeat any other kind of specialized fighter.

The lesson is, like in nature, there is no rule book between species. Whatever wins, is the effectual truth.

This lesson teaches is about political ideologies, mixing it with ordering a meal, teaches us extras how improve our lifethe frontline with our orders.

## Mixed Martial Politics

Species and martial arts have rule books. That why when they fight each other they follow the rules. Political ideologies are the exact same thing. They're rule books, meant to solve specific problems a unique way, while ignoring most other possibilities, just like martial arts.

Conservatism is ...

Progresssivms is ...

Marix is ...

Capitalism is ...



But in truth, life wants us to ignore the rules when outside our bubbles.

The more tools we make, the more cyborgs we make. Human cyborgology keeps expanding. The more rule books each will have. This makes our politics breakdown. We have to learn we can't just following the "rule book" of being a corporate HR cyborg, or a ticket-taker movie usher, or a Blockbuster store manager.

And this return us to ordering anything on the frontline. You're not playing red / blue ideological martial arts. You have a problem. If you vote for a person to represent your interests, they should not every say, "it's not my fault "red/blue" isn't following the rules".

Of course they aren't! They aren't the same species. They hold other tools. They have different rule books. Each species has a different outlook.

Yet iron sharpens iron. The more we fight/debate/argue is good, to see which ideas hold fast. But, inaction is not allowed. An elected representative didn't get yourvote, they got your order. I have problems, whether it being hungry at lunch, small business expenses, or child care.

Either the representative brings back an object to solve that problem, or can point to someone who has, or they don't. Blaming the other side for breaking the rules makes no more sense then a waitress blaming the supply truck for a raw hamburger, or a wrestler saying a kickboxer cheated during an MMA fight.

Political ideologies are tool kits. Ways of potentially solving a problems. Ours are so old they're based on turning mud roads, paper libraries, horse and carriage into a better civlilzatin. Regardless, your on the frontline, you need tools to solve problems.

It's the politicans job to work with other species. Iron sharpens iron. Debate, argue, back stab, whatever. Yet, like in a kitchen or a martial arts fight, the oly thing that matters is the result.

For the extras in the middle class, that means a tool to solve a problem.

## Beaten Bloody Extras

Fighters have cornermen. People actually in their corner during a fight giving them advice and holding the spit bucket.

Imagine what would happen if a karate coach was in someone's corner during a MMA fight, but refused to recognize karate rules don't apply. He'd end up yelling about the rule book to the referee "Hey no holding!" "Hey no choke holds!"

And then he'd be yelling at you "Hey keep it up, your technique is great, your katra's are perfect. this guys cheating, you're gonna win by default"

And then the fight is over, your broken up, and you lose. The coach starts yelling the system is corrupt, that this is all bullshit.

That's why politics is like today. The people are on the frontline, and their ideologies are in teh corner tell them shit that makes no sense anymore. We're not living in the red/blue world. We're getting our asses kicked. And we stay loyal to our long time coach.

Loyalty gets you no where. We lose more fights. The environment changed. We need a new coach, tellins us to do whatever is best for us. We need to pick and choose whatever ideology works. We need Mixed Martial Politics. And how do we judge which works.

Just like life. By assessing the situation on the frontline as fast and accuratrely as possible. That means empowering the extras on the frontline with whatever tool they want, electing politicians who follow orders, and judging results by our senses, and tracking results in something called the Life Star.

We'll build it in the next book.

## Left over



We have to learn to  there is out there,

To fight MMA is the ability to be honest and reflective and care about results, not methods. When an MMA fighter goes up against a tak-won-do specialist, the latter keeps saying how the former "breaks the rules". Yet results is the rule.

Science learned the same lesson. You, individually, don't know how nature works. You test it, you probe it was an hypothesis, and use instruments to test your experiment, and then trying to find what answer nature tells us is true.

MMA is the same thing. There is no established rule book. Let the results tell you what to do. So when you watch a MMA fight, and listen to the corner's advice between rounds, what you hear is practical advice on the situation, and how to win the next round like "use kicks, wrestling, try a submission".

What you don't hear is "he's breaking the rules". Because the only natural rule is the natural selection of tools that best solve the problem.

## Canoe Ride

With ordering a hamburger, fighting MMA, and watching a canoe ride, we'll now fix our politics.

## Mixed Martial Politics

I can't do this anymore. I run away when I see a clip or anything. But, if you still can, watch cable news, especially a political debate, and the supposed analysis afterwards. The politician in office will get bombarded by accusations of rule breaking. And he'll defend himself by defending the rules.

When you ordered the bad hamburger, and the waitress said "we used the approved corporate cooking techniques, so it's not our fault the hamburger is raw", would you ever even care? No. The hamburger is raw. I can touch, smell, and taste the truth. I don't care what rule book you followed. The result is the only thing that matters.

When a MMA fighter sits down between rounds and is bloody from being punched hard. If a wrestling coach tells him "keep it up, he's breaking the rules by punching you, that's not allowed in wrestling" that coach is a moron. There are no rules, but adapting yourself to the problem, to get the result.

When a doctor looks through a microscope and says "that's impossible", he's an idiot. We don't learn anything with a personal rulebook, but instead with a blank one that writes down observations, and adapts ourselves to what it says.

Yet, in politics today, we the people, are distracted by fake rules. We pick a team, red or blue, and let our leaders get away with telling us we have to live with bad hamburgers, or getting the shit kicked out of us in a fight. Pundits and reporters are like karate and judo specialists analyizing a true fight, pointing out the "rules" are being broken.

I, and you, shouldn't care at all what methods, ideologies, beliefs, or opinions our elected leaders have. At all. We should only care about the results. I want a atmosphere with less carbon in the air every year. I want less traffic on the roads. I want less car accidents. I want less.. or more of...

All this happeneings are trackable now. And thus, we can track the results of our politial and economic leaders in making them happen. Raise taxes, cut taxes, private health insurance, public health insurance. Whatever way the cook, fighter, or doctor wants is good with the rules.

And based on history, and theory, the ultimate answer to each will be more individual empowerement to pick one's own tools. Only the cook, the fighter, the doctor, the person encountering the problem, knows what tools. And like in any ecosystem, our job isn't tell enforce human rules, but in making sure other lifeforms are being efficient with resources, so we all keep adapting life on, and beyond, Earth.

We haven't adapted a ruling philospohy to help us make use of our tools. We're like a fighter trying to fight judo to win an MMA fight. It's...
