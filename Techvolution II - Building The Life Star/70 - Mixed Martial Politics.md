## Voting For a Hamburger

I'm going to make a complex political point in a simple way. By ordering a meal at a restaurant. We've all done it; look over the options, think it over, and we say "hamburger with fries" to the waitress Amanda, who writes it down, walks away and you wait.

While you wait you read a book, listen to music, talk with your friends, joke with your spouse, watch your kids draw on the napkins. You're free to do whatever you want. Because while your meal is being made, you have no involvement whatsoever.

In 20-30 minutes Amanda returns, serves and the food with a smile and says "enjoy". You and you're friends chow down.

Ordering a meal is how you should vote. You have a problem. You make your choice. You put people in charge to come back with an object that solves your problem.

The success or failure of the people in charge is entirely dependent on the object they bring you; and you expect the problem to be solved. And vitally your own senses tell you about any problems. The burger is raw, or fries are mushy because you feel, taste, or smell something wrong.

If you do sense a problem you say, "Hey Amanda, something's wrong".

You don't use your intution. You actually smell the object and tell Amanda "smells off doesn't it?", and expect the problem be re-solved because that's what the object was supposed to do; solve a problem.

Now here's the political lesson we learn from ordering a burger' what if Amanda she were to say "well our cook used the proper cooking techniques, so it's not our fault. It must be the supply company, or maybe the stove wasn't hot enough, talk to them."

Would you ever say "okay, well you did your best, I still support red/blue restaurant!"

Of course not. Yet, we think of voting this way. We vote, our problems go unsolved, and politicians say "well I followed red philosophy so it must be something else... Blue, it must be blue's fault!"

We've bought this excuse since the 1970's. Politicians use it, not because they don't care, but because they use old philosophies obsessed with mass producing primitive tools, not distributing powerful digital ones. As problems pile up for polar bears living in the Amazon, they need a reason, and without a new philosophy, they blame each other.

Spend time with a politician during their work day and you'll see first hand who old philosophies punish them; maybe most of all. They do care and it's not an easy job hearing the polar bears complain about raw burgerss and mushy fries. I'll explain it best, and how to fix it, by getting into your corner in a street fight.

## Martial Arts

Lifeforms in nature often fight each other. This can be over mates, territory, or food. Fighting enforces fitness, letting Nature afford to field more lifeforms. Higher biodiverity lets life probe for more environmental changes.

Fighting is thus how lifeforms cooperate. After all, we're _forms_ of life. All species of animals, plants, fungi are merely life's minions to find the best form to represent life in the current environment. To do that, we need to probe the environment to see who should be on the field. All lifeforms thus play on the same team. We fight because we want the best players on the field.

Fighters call this idea "iron sharpens iron". Because fighting, in competition or in practice, is simply both sides cooperating to get better.

Ever notice how species fight the same way. Most obviously seen at mating season when males fight with whatever tool they have like horns, paws, or hooves. They don't act outside this agreed dueling method. A smaller male lion doesn't attack the bigger one at night and murder the star player to get on the team.

This agreement explains human combat systems. Everything from boxing, kickboxing, judo, karate, tak-won-do, jiu-jitsu, and wrestling. Each teaches to fight and win, yet has a set of rules in which to compete. Boxing is punches only. Kickboxing doesn't let you hit a downed opponet. Tak-won-do is mainly kicking with no take-downs. Judo is take-downs with no kicking. Jiu-jitsu is trying to submit someone, wrestling is trying to man handle them.

Each martial art uses the same human body to defeat another in combat. Yet each has a long list of rules both fighters agree on. This is like species, who also agree that the male who charges the hardest, or hits the longest gets to mate because it's agreed the best within the rules gets to start.

This seems natural. We pick hockey, soccer, spelling-bee, stars based on their respective rule books.

But it's not natural because between species there is no rule book. Each is always trying to sharpen each other to find the best star players. Natural selection always rules; only the fittest survive.

This happened in martial arts, when in the early 1990's, someone had the idea to throw away all the rule book and find out which was the best when they fought each other. Throwing away a fake rule book started Mixed Martial Arts.

## Mixed Martial Arts

Like most discoveries, MMA was an accident. A few people were simply were curious which martial art was the best. Brazil had Vale Tudo. Japan had Pancrase and America had the Ultimate Fighting Championship.

After several years of no-holds barred tournamets, people found the answer; throw away the rule book.

In MMA, there are very few outside rules (basically no weapons, eye gouching, or groin strikes). Fighters are free to do almost anything to win. Punches, knees, submissions, clinches, holds, chokes, locks, throws, taunts, insults, work rate, kicks, cart wheels, whatever. Choosing which technique is best, depends on the environment (i.e. the opponent) and the problem at any given moment.

The fighter who best adapts wins.

Thus, "submit and learn" is a strongly believed mantra to MMA fighters. Each martial art is still trained, and still very revered, but MMA fighters mix them all together into their own style. MMA has changed so much in just a few years because fighters either adapt or lose. This is why MMA fighters will defeat any specialized fighter in open combat.

Some martial arts stay ignoreant. Surrounded by a mystical belief system, they delude themselves. Te worst offender may be Akido. A quick YouTube search (sadly) showcases a touch love lesson; in nature, there is no rule book. Whatever wins, is the effectual truth.

Ordering a meal, and learning about MMA, teaching frontline workers how politicians can be expected to get our orders for better tools right, the answer is Mixed Ideological Politics.

## Mixed Ideological Politics

Species and martial arts have rule books. That why when they fight each other they follow the rules. Political ideologies are the exact same thing. They're rule books, meant to solve specific problems a unique way.

Conservatism is preoccupied with wealth generation, they pay little attention to how it should be distributed. This state of indecision between going back and going slow is the characteristic dilemma of the conservative, visible in every issue today.

Progresssivms is ... Progressives argue that wealth is unjustly distributed, for example, but they overlook the need to generate wealth. They also argue for individual liberty and also for progress toward liberty. 

Marix is ...

Capitalism is ...

His difficulty is that progress requires enlightenment and the gradual defeat of prejudiceâ€”whereas liberty requires openness to all opinions, including prejudiced ones. What should a good liberal do for a conservative, teach him to think better or let him be as he is? Here is a conundrum always present to liberals.

But in truth, life wants us to ignore the rules when outside our bubbles.

The more tools we make, the more cyborgs we make. Human cyborgology keeps expanding. The more rule books each will have. This makes our politics breakdown. We have to learn we can't just following the "rule book" of being a corporate HR cyborg, or a ticket-taker movie usher, or a Blockbuster store manager.

And this return us to ordering anything on the frontline. You're not playing red / blue ideological martial arts. You have a problem. If you vote for a person to represent your interests, they should not every say, "it's not my fault "red/blue" isn't following the rules".

Of course they aren't! They aren't the same species. They hold other tools. They have different rule books. Each species has a different outlook.

Yet iron sharpens iron. The more we fight/debate/argue is good, to see which ideas hold fast. But, inaction is not allowed. An elected representative didn't get yourvote, they got your order. I have problems, whether it being hungry at lunch, small business expenses, or child care.

Either the representative brings back an object to solve that problem, or can point to someone who has, or they don't. Blaming the other side for breaking the rules makes no more sense then a waitress blaming the supply truck for a raw hamburger, or a wrestler saying a kickboxer cheated during an MMA fight.

Political ideologies are tool kits. Ways of potentially solving a problems. Ours are so old they're based on turning mud roads, paper libraries, horse and carriage into a better civlilzatin. Regardless, your on the frontline, you need tools to solve problems.

It's the politicans job to work with other species. Iron sharpens iron. Debate, argue, back stab, whatever. Yet, like in a kitchen or a martial arts fight, the oly thing that matters is the result.

For the extras in the middle class, that means a tool to solve a problem.

## Beaten Bloody Extras

Fighters have cornermen. People actually in their corner during a fight giving them advice and holding the spit bucket.

Imagine what would happen if a karate coach was in someone's corner during a MMA fight, but refused to recognize karate rules don't apply. He'd end up yelling about the rule book to the referee "Hey no holding!" "Hey no choke holds!"

And then he'd be yelling at you "Hey keep it up, your technique is great, your katra's are perfect. this guys cheating, you're gonna win by default"

And then the fight is over, your broken up, and you lose. The coach starts yelling the system is corrupt, that this is all bullshit.

That's why politics is like today. The people are on the frontline, and their ideologies are in teh corner tell them shit that makes no sense anymore. We're not living in the red/blue world. We're getting our asses kicked. And we stay loyal to our long time coach.

Loyalty gets you no where. We lose more fights. The environment changed. We need a new coach, tellins us to do whatever is best for us. We need to pick and choose whatever ideology works. We need Mixed Martial Politics. And how do we judge which works.

Just like life. By assessing the situation on the frontline as fast and accuratrely as possible. That means empowering the extras on the frontline with whatever tool they want, electing politicians who follow orders, and judging results by our senses, and tracking results in something called the Life Star.

We'll build it in the next book.

That means we all must be protagonsits, solving problems....the story is more important than the characters. The fight is more important then the coach or his rule book. Life is more important than any life form.

We either tap and learn, or we become antagonist citing a rule book history wont care about anymore than life cares about all the lifeforms gone extinct before we showed up...

## Left over



We have to learn to  there is out there,

To fight MMA is the ability to be honest and reflective and care about results, not methods. When an MMA fighter goes up against a tak-won-do specialist, the latter keeps saying how the former "breaks the rules". Yet results is the rule.

Science learned the same lesson. You, individually, don't know how nature works. You test it, you probe it was an hypothesis, and use instruments to test your experiment, and then trying to find what answer nature tells us is true.

MMA is the same thing. There is no established rule book. Let the results tell you what to do. So when you watch a MMA fight, and listen to the corner's advice between rounds, what you hear is practical advice on the situation, and how to win the next round like "use kicks, wrestling, try a submission".

What you don't hear is "he's breaking the rules". Because the only natural rule is the natural selection of tools that best solve the problem.

## Canoe Ride

With ordering a hamburger, fighting MMA, and watching a canoe ride, we'll now fix our politics.

## Mixed Martial Politics

I can't do this anymore. I run away when I see a clip or anything. But, if you still can, watch cable news, especially a political debate, and the supposed analysis afterwards. The politician in office will get bombarded by accusations of rule breaking. And he'll defend himself by defending the rules.

When you ordered the bad hamburger, and the waitress said "we used the approved corporate cooking techniques, so it's not our fault the hamburger is raw", would you ever even care? No. The hamburger is raw. I can touch, smell, and taste the truth. I don't care what rule book you followed. The result is the only thing that matters.

When a MMA fighter sits down between rounds and is bloody from being punched hard. If a wrestling coach tells him "keep it up, he's breaking the rules by punching you, that's not allowed in wrestling" that coach is a moron. There are no rules, but adapting yourself to the problem, to get the result.

When a doctor looks through a microscope and says "that's impossible", he's an idiot. We don't learn anything with a personal rulebook, but instead with a blank one that writes down observations, and adapts ourselves to what it says.

Yet, in politics today, we the people, are distracted by fake rules. We pick a team, red or blue, and let our leaders get away with telling us we have to live with bad hamburgers, or getting the shit kicked out of us in a fight. Pundits and reporters are like karate and judo specialists analyizing a true fight, pointing out the "rules" are being broken.

I, and you, shouldn't care at all what methods, ideologies, beliefs, or opinions our elected leaders have. At all. We should only care about the results. I want a atmosphere with less carbon in the air every year. I want less traffic on the roads. I want less car accidents. I want less.. or more of...

All this happeneings are trackable now. And thus, we can track the results of our politial and economic leaders in making them happen. Raise taxes, cut taxes, private health insurance, public health insurance. Whatever way the cook, fighter, or doctor wants is good with the rules.

And based on history, and theory, the ultimate answer to each will be more individual empowerement to pick one's own tools. Only the cook, the fighter, the doctor, the person encountering the problem, knows what tools. And like in any ecosystem, our job isn't tell enforce human rules, but in making sure other lifeforms are being efficient with resources, so we all keep adapting life on, and beyond, Earth.

We haven't adapted a ruling philospohy to help us make use of our tools. We're like a fighter trying to fight judo to win an MMA fight. It's...
