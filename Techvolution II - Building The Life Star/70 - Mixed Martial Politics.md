## Voting For a Hamburger

I'm going to make a complex point by order food at a restaurant.

We've all sat down and joked with friends while looking over the options and saying "hamburger with fries". The waitress Amanda writes it down, smiles, and walks away.

While you wait you read a book, talk with your friends, joke with your spouse, watch your kids draw on the napkins. You're free to do whatever you want. You have no job or even say how your meal is made.

In 20-30 minutes Amanda returns, serves the food with a smile and says "enjoy". Ordering meals is only so simple because it's so wise.

And it's how you should vote. You have a problem. You look over the options. You make your choice. And you put an expert in charge to come back with something that solves your problem.

The success or failure of the people in charge is entirely dependent on the thing they bring you. Vitally, you judge their success with your own sense; the burger and fries is good or bad based on your touch, taste, and smell.

And if you do sense a problem you say, "Hey Amanda, something's wrong".

You don't use your intution or listen to marketing. You actually smell something and tell Amanda; "smells off doesn't it?". Because you're using a common sense, Amanda can now smell the object and test it herself.

What if Amanda were to say "well our cook used the proper cooking techniques, so it's not our fault. It must be the supply company, go talk to them."

Would you ever say "okay, well you did your best, I still support red/blue restaurant!"

Of course not. Yet, we think of voting this way. We vote, our problems go unsolved and politicians say "well I followed red philosophy so it must be something else... blue, it must be blue's fault!"

Seens ridicules, yet the struggling middle class has heard this excuse since the 1970's. Politicians use it, not because they don't care, but because they use old philosophies. Obsessed with mass producing primitive tools, not distributing powerful digital ones, our problems pile up for us, the provervial polar bear living in the Amazon.

It harms them as much as anyone. Spend time with some councilmans, state senators, small-town mayors and you'll see first hand they try to do right. It's not an easy to keep hearing the polar bears complain about raw burgerss and mushy fries when the tools your support are the ones causing the problem. Old philosophies of old tools are a useless playbook. Without a new philosophy, red/blue can only blame each other.

I'll explain how to give them a new playbook by getting in your corner.

## Martial Arts

Lifeforms often fight. Usually over mates, territory, or food. We've already learned fighting enforces fitness, empowering Nature to better probe the environmental for changes with more players on the field so to speak.

Sadly, no lifeform is guaranteed playing time. We're all merely _forms_ fighting for a spot on the team. Lifeforms help each other stay sharp. We cooperate byway of competition.

Fighters call this "iron sharpens iron". Because fighting, in competition or in practice, is simply both sides cooperating to get better.

Ever notice how species fight each other. Like two western gun slingers, they have a ritual. For example, males at mating season use whatever their paws, hooves, or horns to kick, claw, or ram each other. They never fight outside the ritual. A benchwarming lion doesn't murder the star player via a late night ambush.

Humans also have agreed upon combat methods. Martial arts in boxing, kickboxing, judo, karate, tak-won-do, jiu-jitsu, and wrestling. Each teaches its students to fight and win; yet has a set of rules in which to compete. Some examples are boxing is punches only. Kickboxing doesn't let you hit a downed opponet. Tak-won-do is mainly kicking with no take-downs. Judo is take-downs with no kicking. Jiu-jitsu is trying to submit someone, wrestling is trying to pin them down.

Each martial art uses the same human body to defeat another in combat. Yet each has a long list of rules both fighters agree on. This is like species, who also agree that the one who wins the ritual gets to mate, or lead the pack, or simply win.

But it's not a natural way to fight. Because in fights between species there is no rule book. The biggest lion, or the toughest ram, doesn't automatically win the day. Dozens of hyenas can ambush a lion. Thousands of ants can harrass the hyenas. One ant eater would eat not run.

Nature as no rule book but natural selection. All lifeforms are always trying to sharpen each other to find the best star players for life. It's a hard realization for any lifeform who thinks being the king of the species makes him a king in Nature.

Martial arts learned this lesson in the early 1990's when someone wanted to find out which system was the best. The answer was, none of them.

## Mixed Martial Arts

Like most ideas, the search to find the best martial art happened in several different areas. Brazil had Vale Tudo. Japan had Pancrase, and America had the Ultimate Fighting Championship.

And fitting of any good story, after several years of no-holds barred tournamets, people were surprised by the answer; throw away the rule book, and mix all the martial arts together.

That's why in Mixed Martial Arts (MMA), there are very few outside rules (basically no eye gouching, biting, or low blows). Fighters are free to do almost anything to win. Punches, knees, submissions, clinches, holds, chokes, locks, throws, taunts, insults, work rate, kicks, cart wheels, whatever. Because in a real fight, anybody would do anything to win.

Fighters win by choosing which technique is best, which depends on the problem and environment (i.e. the opponent), at any given moment. The fighter who best adapts wins.

Thus, "submit and learn" is another strongly believed mantra to MMA fighters. Each martial art is still trained, and still very revered, but MMA fighters mix them all together into their own style. Evolution in the sport is very fast. This is why MMA fighters defeat any specialized fighter in open combat.

Even so, some martial arts stay ignorant. While boxing or jiu-jitsu know they're limited, they aim to excel inside they're limitations. They're expertise is what MMA fighters harness. However other martial arts reject the lesson. The worst offender may be Akido. A quick YouTube search (sadly) showcases a tough lesson. Watching an Akido master get their ass kicked by a MMA fighter is like watching a peacock getting caught by a tiger and thinking "but my plumb was brighter".

In Nature, whether on the Savanah, or on the streets, there is no rule book. Whatever wins, is the effectual truth. It's a hard won lesson that's easy to forget if anyone thinks the rules protect them.

The ultimate lesson for us to learn is this. Ordering a meal, and learning about MMA, teaches us frontline workers how politicians can be expected to get our orders right. The answer is Mixed Ideological Politics.

## Mixed Ideological Politics

Frontline people have many problems. Crushing personal debt, housing payments they can't keep up with, living next to strangers in suburbia. Because of past heroes, we have the political power to demand help.

We vote for help, politicians get in office, and when we ask were our order is, we're told "We used the best red philosophy... go talk to blue, it's their fault!

Political ideologies, whether red, blue, purple, or green, are the same as martial arts like kickboxing or judo. They're rule books meant to solve specific problems a unique way. Here's a run down.

Conservatism is preoccupied with wealth generation and pays little attention to how it should be spread around. On social changes, conservatism prefers slow and prudent adjustments to make sure society stays steady. They thus have a constant state of indecision between going back and going slow, visible in most every issue today. People happy with their paychecks, the way things were, or who wish to join the ranks, are usually conservatives.

Progresssivms is preoccupied with spreading the wealth, and usually believe it's unjustly controlled by greedy people. Yet they overlook the need to generate wealth. On the social front, they say why should oppressed and disadvantaged people patiently wait to be liberted. Thus, progressives argue for individual liberty and constant progress toward liberty. They however don't know what to do with a person who disagrees with them, because liberty requires different opinions, even ones against progress.

Capitalism saw mud roads, herbal medicines, and hand made wool jackets and said this is bullshit. Humanity can do better. We must do better to be life's star players. It's ideas would be familiar to any farmer or botanist.

Because remember tools are a lifeforms. So to propagate more tools, we only need to what all lifeforms do to get more, propagate many young and protect them against harm. This is the basis of sacrocent property rights of modern economics. The more we protect early lifeforms, the more they die, and their resulting biomass fertilizes a larger and large ecosystem.

Marism agrees with capitalism. That concentrating property into a few hands will cause it to grow every wider. However, Marx says the workers should get a fair share of the wealth generated.

Liking wealth generation and keeping it in the hands of those who traditionally have it is why most conservatives are proud capitalists. Thinking the world should be fairer, even if that means forcefully, is why many progressives like Marxism.

No ideology is self-sufficient. Conservatives would have lower classes fend for scraps, while Progressives would tax the rich to join them. Capitalists think any and all property is hallowed, even the spectacle of modern gas cars, houses, and movies. Marxists want to find new ways why history keeps being wrong instead of their theory.

For the frontline voter, none of this matters any more than finding out what stove, or cooking technique the burger joint is using. We're the ones in the ring fighting for our survival.

## Beaten Bloody Extras

Fighters have cornermen. Coaches and advisers giving them advice before and during a fight.

Imagine what would happen if a karate coach refused to recognize karate rules don't apply in a MMA fight. He'd yell to the referee; "Hey no choke holds!"

And then he'd be yelling at you "Keep it up, your technique is great, this guys cheating, you're gonna win by default!"

And when the fight is over, and your beaten bloody, and the other girl gets her hand raised. The coach starts yelling the system is corrupt, that this is all bullshit, and that you did everything properly. The other guy is to blame.

That's what politics is today. Coaches using different ideological rule books yelling about the rules.

And the people are in the ring, on the frontline honestly taking the advice of experts, who can't realize in Nature, there are no rule books by the effectual truth. We're getting our asses kicked. And we stay loyal to our long time coach. We need to use Mixed Ideological Politics.

## Techvolution in Your Corner

Just like life. By assessing the situation on the frontline as fast and accuratrely as possible. That means empowering the extras on the frontline with whatever tool they want, electing politicians who follow orders, and judging results by our senses, and tracking results in something called the Life Star.

We'll build it in the next book.

That means we all must be protagonsits, solving problems....the story is more important than the characters. The fight is more important then the coach or his rule book. Life is more important than any life form.

We either tap and learn, or we become antagonist citing a rule book history wont care about anymore than life cares about all the lifeforms gone extinct before we showed up...

Techvolution is about expanding the people's toolbox by letting them use whatever tool best solves their problem. We should demand our politics uses whatever playbook needed to get us there.

## How to make red/blue agree

Lifestar, use a common sense. Senses....

## Techvolution in Your Corner2

And this return us to ordering anything on the frontline. You're not playing red / blue ideological martial arts. You have a problem. If you vote for a person to represent your interests, they should not every say, "it's not my fault "red/blue" isn't following the rules".

Of course they aren't! Their from a different sport with different rule books. The skill is to mix them.

How, that's not your problem. An elected representative didn't get your vote, they got your order. Whether it being hungry at lunch, rising small business expenses, or incompentent bosses giving themselves raises paid for by unpaid overtime.

Either the representative brings back an object to solve that problem, or can point to someone who has, or they don't. Blaming the other side for breaking the rules makes no more sense then a waitress blaming the supply truck for a raw hamburger, or a wrestler saying a kickboxer cheated during an MMA fight.

Political ideologies are tool kits. Ways of potentially solving a problems. Ours are so old they're based on turning mud roads, paper libraries, horse and carriage into a better civlilzatin. Regardless, your on the frontline, you need tools to solve problems.

It's the politicans job to work with other species. Iron sharpens iron. Debate, argue, back stab, whatever. Yet, like in a kitchen or a martial arts fight, the only thing that matters is the result.



## Left over

We have to learn to  there is out there,

To fight MMA is the ability to be honest and reflective and care about results, not methods. When an MMA fighter goes up against a tak-won-do specialist, the latter keeps saying how the former "breaks the rules". Yet results is the rule.

Science learned the same lesson. You, individually, don't know how nature works. You test it, you probe it was an hypothesis, and use instruments to test your experiment, and then trying to find what answer nature tells us is true.

MMA is the same thing. There is no established rule book. Let the results tell you what to do. So when you watch a MMA fight, and listen to the corner's advice between rounds, what you hear is practical advice on the situation, and how to win the next round like "use kicks, wrestling, try a submission".

What you don't hear is "he's breaking the rules". Because the only natural rule is the natural selection of tools that best solve the problem.

## Canoe Ride

With ordering a hamburger, fighting MMA, and watching a canoe ride, we'll now fix our politics.

## Mixed Martial Politics

I can't do this anymore. I run away when I see a clip or anything. But, if you still can, watch cable news, especially a political debate, and the supposed analysis afterwards. The politician in office will get bombarded by accusations of rule breaking. And he'll defend himself by defending the rules.

When you ordered the bad hamburger, and the waitress said "we used the approved corporate cooking techniques, so it's not our fault the hamburger is raw", would you ever even care? No. The hamburger is raw. I can touch, smell, and taste the truth. I don't care what rule book you followed. The result is the only thing that matters.

When a MMA fighter sits down between rounds and is bloody from being punched hard. If a wrestling coach tells him "keep it up, he's breaking the rules by punching you, that's not allowed in wrestling" that coach is a moron. There are no rules, but adapting yourself to the problem, to get the result.

When a doctor looks through a microscope and says "that's impossible", he's an idiot. We don't learn anything with a personal rulebook, but instead with a blank one that writes down observations, and adapts ourselves to what it says.

Yet, in politics today, we the people, are distracted by fake rules. We pick a team, red or blue, and let our leaders get away with telling us we have to live with bad hamburgers, or getting the shit kicked out of us in a fight. Pundits and reporters are like karate and judo specialists analyizing a true fight, pointing out the "rules" are being broken.

I, and you, shouldn't care at all what methods, ideologies, beliefs, or opinions our elected leaders have. At all. We should only care about the results. I want a atmosphere with less carbon in the air every year. I want less traffic on the roads. I want less car accidents. I want less.. or more of...

All this happeneings are trackable now. And thus, we can track the results of our politial and economic leaders in making them happen. Raise taxes, cut taxes, private health insurance, public health insurance. Whatever way the cook, fighter, or doctor wants is good with the rules.

And based on history, and theory, the ultimate answer to each will be more individual empowerement to pick one's own tools. Only the cook, the fighter, the doctor, the person encountering the problem, knows what tools. And like in any ecosystem, our job isn't tell enforce human rules, but in making sure other lifeforms are being efficient with resources, so we all keep adapting life on, and beyond, Earth.
