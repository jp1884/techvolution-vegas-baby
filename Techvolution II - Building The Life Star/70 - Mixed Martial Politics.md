## Voting For a Hamburger

Most of us have ordered a meal at a restaurant. We don't sit much of it. We sit down and joke with friends while looking over the options and eventually saying "hamburger with fries" to the waitress Amanda. She writes down the order, smiles, and walks away.

While we wait we talk with friends, joke with our spouse, watch our kids draw on something. We're free to do whatever because we're not invovlved in making our meal. In 20-30 minutes Amanda returns, serves the food, and says "enjoy".

Ordering meals is simple. And it's how we should all vote.

Here's why. At a restaurant, you enter with a problem. You look over the options, and put an expert in charge to come back with something that solves your problem. The success or failure of the people in charge is entirely dependent on the thing they bring you. And you evaluate the thing with your own senses. Meaning the burger and fries is either good or bad based on your own touch, taste, and smell.

If you do sense a problem you say you simply say "Hey Amanda, something's wrong".

You don't use your intution or anyone else's. You actually smell the burger and tell Amanda; "smells off doesn't it?", and because you're using a common sense, Amanda can now smell the object and test it herself.

If Amanda responds "well our cook used the proper cooking techniques, so it's not our fault. It must be the supply company, go talk to them."

Would you ever say "okay, well you did your best, I still support red/blue restaurant!"

Of course not. Yet, in politics, when our problems go unsolved our politicians respond like that. They say "well I followed red philosophy so it must be something else... blue, it must be blue's fault!"

Seems ridicules, yet the struggling middle class has accepted this excuse since the 1970's. Politicians use it, not because they don't care, but because they follow old philosophies obsessed with keeping people from majically bonding with digital tools. Turning the middle class struggling with endless traffic, mountains of laws, increasing cost of living into the proverbial polar bear trying to live in the Amazon.

It hurts politicians as much as anyone. Spend time with councilors, state senators, or mayors and you'll find out listening struggling polar bear's is a hard day. Sadly, without a new philosophy letting the polar bear adapt with new tools, red/blue can only blame each other (with increasing hatred) for their philosophies shared failing.

I'll explain how we can fix this by getting in your corner during a fight.

## Martial Arts

Humans also have many different martial arts. Whether it be boxing, kickboxing, judo, karate, tak-won-do, jiu-jitsu, or wrestling. Each teaches its students to fight and win; yet has a set of rules in which to compete. Boxing only allows punches. Kickboxing doesn't let you hit a downed opponet. Tak-won-do is mainly kicking with no take-downs. Judo is take-downs with no kicking. Jiu-jitsu is trying to choke someone, wrestling is trying to pin them down.

Only using a few tools, like kicks, or throws, mimicks species when they fight each other. Male sheep will ram each other all day, but will never attack a sleeping opponent to win the right to mate. Likewise each martial art uses the same human body to defeat another in combat. Yet each has a long list of rules both fighters agree on.

Fighting within a rules is mostly though unnatural. Nature as no rule but letting the fittest survive by any means neccesary. Martial arts learned this lesson in the early 1990's when someone wanted to find out which system was the best. Happily, their answer also tell us how to solve our political debates.

## Mixed Martial Arts

Like many discoveries, many people we're searching for the best martial art at the same time. In the 1990's the search created organizations like Vale Tudo, Pancrase, and the Ultimate Fighting Championship.

And despite ardent believers vouching for their own favorite martial art, the faces of beaten and bloody combatants inside dozens of no-holds barred tournamets gave a surprising yet logical answer. The best martial art was "throw away the rule book", and mix them all together. Rules for rules sake was quickly seen to be a Death Star to one's physical health.

That realization was the birth of the new sport called Mixed Martial Arts (MMA). In MMA there are few rules (basically no biting, eye pokes, or low blows). Fighters are free to do almost anything to win. Punches, knees, submissions, clinches, holds, chokes, locks, slams, throws, taunts, work rate, kicks, cart wheels, whatever. Seems funny upon reflection, but despite hundreds of years of martial arts, before the 1990's, nobody ever thought to mix all these techniques together.

So, MMA fighters win their contests by choosing which technique to use based on the immediate problem their facing. Like in Nature, the fighter who adapts the fastest wins. Thus, MMA fighters heavily believe in accepting responsibility for their actions is a good thing, encapsulated in the often used mantra "submit and learn".

Importantly, each martial art is still excellent in its own realm. They specialize in submssions or punches, and thereby teach MMA fighters skills no generalists could ever learn themselves. What MMA fighters do is take these specialized skills and mix them all together into their own style. With no rule book to confine options, evolution in MMA is very fast. Its fighters are constantly trying to keep up.

Sadly, while most martial artists accept their limitations and now seek to master their speciality, a few reject the lesson entirely. A YouTube search for "Akido master versis MMA fighter" shows what happens when this fantasy meets reality.

The lesson here is learning to see rule books can be helpfult to master a speciality. Yet, when it comes down to it, Nature, whether on the Savanah, or on the streets, gives us no rules. Whatever wins is the effectual truth.

The ultimate lesson is something more specific. MMA teaches us why it okay to expect our politicians to get our orders right. They should use Mixed Ideological Politics.

## Mixed Ideological Politics

Political ideologies, whether red, blue, purple, or green, are the same as martial arts. They're rule books meant to solve specific problems in a unique way.

Each of today's ideologies has advantages and disavantages. Neo-cons, liberals, socialists, greens, social conservatives, low-tax liberals. I'm not going to debate the strengths and weaknesses in them here. The point is there is a debate. No ideology is self-sufficient.

Yet today they act like they are. Every ideology has a plan for climate change, government debt reduction, healthcare reform, modernizing education, getting rid of traffic, airport renewal and so on. But each gets worse because politicians think their ideology can answer every problem, and they judge themselves according to their own rule book, not the effectual truth of improving life on the frontline.

Even though most voters are already willing to try out different ideologies, most politicians are not. Unwiling to do whatever it takes to get results, they stay loyal to their ideology rather than admit, all ideologes have virtues and drawbacks.

That's what keeps red/blue philosophies from adapting to digital tools. Like a aging sitcom, they've moved into the self-importance and are unwilling to change, and use the spectacle of high-paced news coverages, big loud speeches, and grandstanding with the controls of government at their hands to distract the extras from their continued failure.

 And this ignorance is causing the middle class to get the shit kick out of us.

## Beaten Bloody Extras

Fighters have coaches and advisers giving them advice before and during a fight. They're called cornermen because they sit at a fighters corner when they're in the ring.

Now, imagine what would happen if a old-school karate coach put a student into a MMA fight. Only using karate technique would get your ass kicked.

When your opponent gets her arm raised in victory, your coach would start yelling "the system is corrupt, this is all bullshit, you did everything properly. I did everything properly".

Seems silly, but that's what politicians and political partisans do today. Red/blue are just coaches using different ideological rule books who refuse to mix in new ideas as needed to solve whatever problem they're orderd to solve.

And we the people are in the ring, on the frontline, getting our asses kicked. Some are misguided enough to believe red or blue is good enough on its own. Most people try switching their their vote between red and blue hoping for some help.

None comes. Because we don't have Mixed Ideological Politics. Yet we do with a ruling philosophy of Techvolution we can. Because with tecovlution the definition of political success is not ideological purity, but solving problems on the frontline with tools to fight whatever problem troubles us.

We get Techvolution by electing representatives who want to be protagonists. People who can realize they didn't get our vote, they got our order. Whether its the right to repair our own electronics, rising small business expenses, or incompentent bosses giving themselves raises paid for by unpaid overtime. We need tools to solve these problems.

That doesn't mean we should demand dreams to come true. But either the representative helps make a tool to solve our problem, or can point to someone who has, or they don't. They're free to use whatever means neccesary. But blaming "the other side" for breaking the rules makes no more sense then a waitress blaming the supply truck for a raw hamburger, or a wrestler saying a MMA fighter cheated.

The question is, like smelling our food, or feeling an ass kicking, what common sense can we use to judge the results of the tools Techvolution gives us.

## Techvolution in Your Corner

Just like Nature lets lifeforms adapt however they need to, so should we.

We'll build it in the next book.

That means we all must be protagonsits, solving problems....the story is more important than the characters. The fight is more important then the coach or his rule book. Life is more important than any life form.

We either tap and learn, or we become antagonist citing a rule book history wont care about anymore than life cares about all the lifeforms gone extinct before we showed up...

Techvolution is about expanding the people's toolbox by letting them use whatever tool best solves their problem. We should demand our politics uses whatever playbook needed to get us there.

How to make red/blue agree. The Life Star, use a common sense. Senses....
