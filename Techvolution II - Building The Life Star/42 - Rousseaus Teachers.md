# Rousseau's Teachers

Rousseau told taught us alot. He explained what happens when a society lives inside spectacle and art, to hide from the fact the Sith have kept the divide between old societies and new ones artificially too wide. The nobility thinks they are divine, and tricks the people into believe it. Rousseau called bullshit, and with his philosophy made society function again.

Every great thinker builds on the work of others. Issac Newton linage goes on Kepler, Galieo, Copernicus, Aristarchus. Same for Rousseau. Here's where the idea's imbedded into his philosophy. We take note to be sure we include them each into the Life Star.

## Shoulder's of Giants

The first modern protagonist was Niccolo Machiavelli (1469-1527). He was born was poor, but his father got him many books from the recent printing press, and mixing a commoner upbriging with new tools, proved itself again to be a recipe for protagonism.

Printing press books were changing the world. Seemingly overnight, Europe was covered with books of all topics. The ruling philosophy was based on human created rules like nobles divinity and geo-centrism. Quick and easy knowledge let people find different answers, ones increasingly rooted in Nature. Darth King went to work defending his ruling philosophy with a host of rules.

Machiavelli read much Greek and Roman history and philosophy and soon realized humanity didn't need human created rules so much. Machiavelli foresaw a new ruling philosophy where humanity overcomes problems, by using human reason to build new tools. A human written rule book is a crutch, and now an especially unneeded crutch for a society with the printing press and scientific instruments. Humanity could master the many misfortunes of Nature with new tools.

If, Machiavelli said, humanity were to wise up, and ignored the "imagined world" of the human created rules, and judge human actions for their "effectual truth" on making the real-world better or not based on the problems on the frontline. He called this world new "modes and orders".

People answered the call for "effectual truth". They formalized the idea inside the scientific method. Which is the testing of Nature's to find its unbiased rules. Once telescopes, microscopes, and better mathematics were invented, a chorus of people used the scientific method in astronomy, chemistry, and biology.

## Hobbes and Locke

The Scientific Revolution discovered many wondrous details of the universe. Things like the Earth revolves around the Sun, human anatomy, and the laws of motion. Scientists made using the human made rules the basis of all human thought look silly.

And it was in their tradition of questioning the natural world, that spawned the Age of Enlightenment (1687-1789). The Enlightenment was when humanity itself "wised up" by directing scientific questions to better understand not just physical nature, but human nature.

Now Thankfully, it wasn't long before dress wearing, banquest obsessed, cake eating, self-described divine nobles, were under the spotlight of effectual truth.

Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679), writing during the chaos of the English Civil Wars, started the long process to give Europe a new political ruling philosophy. He started it by defending an absolute monarchy, saying a super strong government is the cure against chaos. Hobbes said everyone should obey one king, who he called Leviathan, to avoid the anarchy that makes human life that is "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."

How Hobbes justified his nobility was monumental. Like Machiavelli, Hobbes disliked human created rules, so he didn't use the "divine right to rule". Instead, he said humanity is naturally, in our State of Nature, equal. The State of Nature is a place without government, where we're all equal because... well whose to say otherwise. Hobbes biggest proof of our equality is, without government, we can all kill each other with our ability to scheme, plot, and murder. So to keep everyone from killing each other, the people should forfeit their natural rights of equality to a Leviathan to ensure everyone's security.

Thus, _the King_ and _the People_, would have a social contract with each other. One based on equality, that ends in complete tyranny, but that guarantees everyone's security from the anarchy. This reasoning, believe it or not, started the liberalism that we have today. From constitutions, to the right to own property like race cars, and the right to control ones body with abortions, all guaranteed by the social contract between the people, and Leviathan, or what we call government. Guaranteed if these rights didn't threaten the country's all important security.

We'd recognize Leviathan better after reading John Locke (1632-1704). Locke says it's too idealistic to expect one person to be Leviathan. If power corrupts, then absolute power corrupts absolutely. Thus, Locks says its best to divide government's Leviathan powers up in executive, legisative, and judicial branches. Each would "check and balance" each other, to prevent a government that's worst than the anarchy it's supposed to get rid of.

Locke's philosophy is behind our written constitutions, bills of rights, elected governments, citizens right to bear arms, checks and balances between executives, elected legislatures, lawful judges, freedom of speech, and freedom of religion. Mass printed books, guns, scientific instruments and many others, were enshrined by Locke into society's ruling philosphy, via constitutions. Most people today live under Locke's Leviathan.

Rousseau (1712-1778) liked, but disagreed with, Locke and Hobbes. Yes, humanity is naturally equal, but said humanity is only murderous in a society. If a thinker goes back farther into human nature and history, they'd find happy-go-luck hunter gatherers who weren't filled with the envy, jealously, or anxiety of modern humans living under unnatural ruling philosophies. This is where Rousseau's philosophy, "Man is born free; but everywhere he is in chains" that we discussed earlier came from. Rousseau says yes society needs a social contract, but one that harnesses the natural goodness of humanity.

Rousseau thus keeps Hobbes' social contract, but wants to create a new person to live inside it. Rousseau's Leviathan is not concentrated into a single person, or even a checked and balanced government, but is distributed throughout society via direct democracy. Meaning there are no representatives of government inside a nobility, or a elected representatives. Instead, all people who live under the all powerful Leviathan, also control the Leviathan.

To have this new society, requires a totally "new person". Someone who can give responsible commands to society, while accepting the rules society gives back.

Once Locke and Rousseau's ideas spread, democratic nation states emerged from the feudal kingdoms. The number of wars declined, because once the extras fighting the wars on the battlefield ruled their society, they didn't want more wars than absolutely necessary. Empowering the people breeds collaboration not competition.

We can see this best in our militaries. The armies of kingdoms were loyal to their king. Kings only answered to themselves. Thus, their militaries weren't often volunteers, but conscripts and paid mercenaries. They often looted and pillaged to make their money.

However, the armies of George Washington and other democracies were different. They were fighting not for a human made rule, but for Nature. Understanding nature empowers everyone. Thus, democractic soldiers don't need to loot and pillage and swear loyalty to any other man. They fight for liberty.

These are the lessons of Rousseau. We must uncover the effectual truth, to discard our imagined world, and make a new reality embedded with Nature's lessons. This, means we're all naturally equal, and must live inside a social order with checks and balances, with the freedom of speech. Ideally its best to make each person responsible for their actions inside this Leviathan of a society.

As it happens, what Machiavelli to Rousseau were talking about is making ecosystems. And that's what we need to do for ourselves. Once we do, the rest will fall into place.
