- Why Can't Dreams Be Memories

## Emile, Or On Teaching Us To Stargaze

*Yeah... first time I made this [butter scotch rum] was for your mother. I'd been wanting to pop the question but I was afraid she'd say no. This gave me the nerve to ask her and I got myself a great big "yes"... and that wasn't the only "yes" I got from her that night either. [laughs] Still scares me to think how close I came to chickening out, though. You know, as you get older, it's not the failures you regret, or the times you made an ass of yourself. It's the times you never even tried, when you just lost your nerve.*

## Prologue

I've got this great story about two friends stealing a monkey from a zoo.

They were in college and it was summer break. Smoking weed, eating loads of crap, and binge watching YouTube. They were content inside their suburban life.

Then a zoo commercial came on.

They watched in awe. It was the small monkey. The primate wasn't doing anything special. He was jumping around, taking fruit from peoples hands, playing hide and seek with the zoo keepers.

That stuff is cool of course, but the ad caught my friends attention not because of the monkey, it was the people; everyone around the monkey was so happy; like pure joy happy. To the two stoners sitting in a messy basement wasting away their youth, this monkey was a shot of life.

No that's not it.

This little monkey was a shot _at a life_.

When the commercial ended the two guys were thunderstruck. Minutes passed in silence as their souls bolossumed with purpose.

"We need a monkey". Said one friend.

Their was only one possible reply,

"Today".

The friends assembled what they had in hand--rope, fruit, fake IDs--into an ingenious plan. With smiles ear to ear, they set out for the small regional zoo.

And?

And their plan worked. These two potheads wanted to reboot their lives with an energetic new friend, and they did.

Their dreams became reality. How awesome is that!

There are problems here of course...animal welfare, theft...but the biggest roadblock was something else entirely. You see, once my friends got to dreaming, they're dreams got bigger.

Good for them you might say!

Well... the first problem is their joints got bigger too (of course they kept smoking), but big dreams filled their heads so much, they ignored the cute little monkeys.

They stole a 50 pound baboon.

Ross on *Friends* had a pet monkey Marcel. It was a cuddly little creature. Baboons are not. They're extremely strong, agile, and emotional primates. And that's not the worst part. The truly scary fact is baboons live in big, loving, very protective families.

This stolen baboon certainly did.

And this family acted fast and made a plan. It wasn't ingenious. It was very aggressive. Baboons gathered. Baboons rampaged. Glass shattered. Metal broke.

For a few minutes, on the fields of a regional zoo, my two pothead friends were hunted down by a family of murderous baboons. They made memories that day. They remember every detail while running for their lives.

And they learned what so few do in time to enjoy it. Time is the most valuable thing in the Universe. It's the only thing you can make, manufacture, or reverse.

Gladly, everything worked out with my friends and the monkey. The stolen one was reunited and my friends got out okay. And because nothing bad happened, I ended up with a sure fire way to make anyone laugh. No matter who I've told, happy drunks or suffering souls, everyone's day brightens-up when I tell the story about two idiots stealing a monkey from a zoo.

And every time I've told the story, I feel like a comic with a killer act, getting to watch the audience sit, laugh, hug, and kiss, as they together create a new memory.

All made possible because someone took a chance at failure.

---

People can't help but enjoy the story because Life gifted every life-form a pathway to happiness. Bison love to graze. Cats love to hunt. I bet even trees smile when Spring sunshine comes. Every human loves spending their time experiencing a good story.

But have you every wondered why we need stories so badly?

Stories are our motivation to keep dreaming. Fighting for our dreams, be it losing weight or curing cancer, is how we humans help life prosper. 

Yet, here's my point, everything isn't rainbows and sunshine on our planet. We don't live in the Garden of Eden. Happiness is rare. Most tree saplings don't find sunlight. Most lion hunts fail miserably. Elephants are often starving while they roam the Serengeti looking for something to eat.

Anyone who's watched BBC Planet Earth knows this and soon learns most lifeforms spend their time in hunger, desperation, and pain.

Humans are no different. Despite our deepest dreams, most real-life stories don't have Hollywood endings. And while humanity loves sharing our stories of success (the monkey story could easily have not been so funny), sharing our painful failures isn't so easy.

But we all have so many painful stories. We must. Depression, bankruptcy, harassment aren't just words. They're terrible stories lived by real people every day. You might be reading this right now trying to forget something in your life. For every dream in our heads there can many more nightmares.

It's easy to think our dreams will never come true.

Life demands we keep dreaming. I say Life here, but you can insert God, Nature, Mother Earth, Consciousness; whatever force you think put us in this Universe so hostile to all of Life's creatures.

For life to prosper, It needs all lifeforms to overcome the pain of failure and keep fighting for life's prosperity because if we don't, the game is over, the story ends, and Life looks for someone else to battle the Universe to stay alive.

---

It's too bad I'll never hear your stories. I know you've added some great chapters to the story of life. But I am going to tell you this story. No, I'm not going to tell you about the poor baboon lured into a car trunk. Since I have you here, I'm going to tell you a much better tale.

This story will give you dreams. Better yet, this story will motivate you to embrace the pain needed to turn your dreams into reality.

Just as Life wants us to live. Always fighting for our happiness. Never scared of failure. Embracing anxiety, disappointment, and despair because the truth is untried dreams are the only ever-lasting agony.

The hero of this story is your dream maker, your stargazer who accepts misery because it fuels his dreams.

This hero shows us all how to make more memories and live a better story.

I'm going to tell you a story about two kids visiting a Hospital Emergency Room. I'm going to tell you a story about the one who never left.

- note, the two kids are Mark. He learns to leave the doubter behind?

## Candy Cane

A big glass revolving door spins. It spins and spins. It keeps spinning because that's what it does; it lives to keep people moving.

This spinning door serves to move people in and out of a huge brick building. It's moving lots of people tonight. Individuals keep stepping into the rotating metal and glass to enter the building, and others are leaving to resume their lives.

Each entrance and exit is the start of a new story.

On the outside is a downtown city street. The cityscape has been the backdrop to human stories since it was constructed in the late 1800s. That era's brick buildings, narrow roads, and city squares filled with shops, bars, and restaurants built a environment where people could thrive.

We can see that tonight as a gentle snowfall covers the bustling city like a blanket on a newborn. The heated outdoor patios, the window shoppers, and the Christmas decorations hanging on the many monuments turn the already nice city into a dreamscape fit for a holiday card.

An artist agrees. She was walking in the city to some gathering, but she had to stop and take out her every-present iPad and Apple pen. Sitting a park bench, she practices her craft.

This image is worth immortalizing.

The artists pencil outlines the gothic buildings, bronze statues, and the couples walking hand in hand while window shopping for presents to surprise their loved ones with.

The infinite canvas of an iPad means she can add incredible detail.

Soon the artist draws the spinning door that's ever doing it's part to keep the street alive and people moving.

The artist is talented. She has artistic skill of course, but her talent is capturing emotion. Her illustrations tell stories. She notices the people going into the spinning doors have deliberate steps and stiff necks; while the people leaving are often relieved.

She starts to add this detail into her infinite canvas.

Then a kid with white sneakers jumps into those spinning doors. He goes around a few times pretending to be coming and going each time.

It runs contrary to her work, so the artist doesn't capture the moment, but she does chuckle at the sight.

Finally, the shoes finally going inside the building, stop on the thick black carpet that has "Hopedale Hospital" written in large pink letters.

The white shoes stomp and stomp and stomp. The dancer makes a point to kick-off fluffy snow from their dancing shoes.

Of course other people keep coming and going into the hospital. These people don't stop and wipe themselves clean of salt and snow. Instead they walk past the dancing kid and spread gunk with every step.

But this kid keeps dancing and keeps taking the time to remove all the shit from outside. Only when finally clean does the kid stop. He's out of breadth but he's beaming a smile in self-satisfaction.

The kid's name is Mark. He's just about to turn a teenager, but looks young for his age. He looks even younger when he pulls a candy cane from inside his jacket with childish glee.

- note. Mark sees the pictures/notes/calls are memories other people have lived. His on a mission to get his own. And why not live the iconic ones.

It's a high-end treat with deep red and white swirls, a huge silver bow, and a card signed by the baker. If the artist saw this candy cane she'd devote a painting to it no doubt; the candy cane embodies the childish dreams so many people have around Christmas time.

Mark twirls the treat like a pencil. He then stops the trick, takes out a pocket knife, and cuts the plastic off the candy cane with delicate care.

Enjoying his candy cane, Mark looks around the Hopedale hospital Emergency Room.

It's 8pm. A high traffic time. Almost all 40 chairs are filled. Before Mark can look some more, a nurse sitting behind a desk asks, "Hi, can you please take a seat."

She's the triage nurse and assess everyone for their illness. She's been doing the job for 14 years and knows what people will say (and is usually right) before they do.

Mark politely goes to the nurse and takes a seat.

"Thank you." says the nurse. "Can you please tell me where it hurts.". Mark steals a few looks at several picture frames on the nurses desk. She's got two kids, who went to Disneyland.

Mark soon looks back at the nurse.

"It's my stomach. I feel queasy. I was at a Christmas party and my mom thinks I ate something bad there. Maybe I did. But I definitely snuck in some eggnog. Don't tell her."

The nurse looks up. There's a lady, Carolina, wrapped in layers from head to toe standing behind Mark. She doesn't say anything. Instead she hands the nurse a piece of paper, presumably the insurance details.

"Her English isn't so good. Portuguese. I'll translate."

"Okay. Do you feel like you have to vomit?" the nurse asks while typing. She barely looks at Carolina or Mark.

"Like my teacher just called a pop quiz. Candy canes help soothe the pain for some reason."

"When you press on your stomach, is there any sharp pains, like a pin is sticking into your skin?"

Mark shakes his head "No".

The nurse keeps typing and says, "Okay, please take this bag and please use it if you need to. We'll call you soon."

"Will it be long?"

"Maybe an hour and you'll be on your way." Mark responds with; "An hour is doable. Thank you."

- remember Mark needs to get back to his room quickly.
- he's snuck into, or was at the Christmas party? Where he asked Carolina for help?
- And Carolina has a short break.

While the nurse finishes up her paperwork, Mark gets up, walks towards the waiting room, and again looks around the ER.

He's not looking at the few empty chairs spattered around. He's looking at the full ones. There's a host of people here. Elderly, young, girls, boys.

Who will he sit beside?

Mark sucks on his candy. He's halfway through the treat already. He makes his choice and walks through the rows and seats.

There's no space for Carolina so she sits a row away. Being a foreigner she's used to giving her kid the reins when they're out in public.

As Carolina takes out her crossword puzzle, Mark shuffles in his chair and says to himself "Where to start, what should I say."

He's looking around. Scoping the people out. Younger, older, white, black, male, female. A nice eclectic group of people who a few minutes before were sharing that idyllic illustration on the snow covered city streets.

The image an artist had to capture.

And, we've all been here before, like any bus, train, or waiting room, a bunch of people are sitting together, in a community they share, all with much in common.

And most everyone is staring into their smartphones.

Mark looks around at each person fixation on YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, or Netflix.

Mark decides on the simple route and asks the person next to him "Hi, what's going on?"

His neighbor says "The Office".

"Oh that's cool. Which episode?"

"It's the one where Michael wears women's clothes." The strangers responds barely breaking eye contact.

"Oh that one's good. I won't ruin it for you."

"I've seen it before."

"You have? Why are you watching it again?"

"It's funny."

"Wanna see a magic trick instead?"

The Michael Scott fan pulls his head up and waits. A few people glance over.

Mark takes a candy cane out. He presents it like a magician by twirling it in his hands until he shakes his hand, once, twice, and BAM!....

Out comes two candy canes.

The Michael Scott says "Neat trick." A few people smile a little. But everyone goes back to their phones.

"Everyone wants to be the star" says a teenage girl to Michael Scott.

"Hey, what is your name?" Mark asks the girl. He gets ignored.

"My name is Mark. And I make my Mark with magic. Magic Mark if you like. We'll not so magic, like but on the way. See magic isn't a title like nurse or whatever. You're only as good as you're last trick, and the race is your practicing self never be caught up by your performance self. Ricky Jay he's the magician of record for me. I mean he can toss a playing card into a watermelon. Not magic you might say, well check out his slight of hand and you can't see nothing, even in slow motion."

No one's paying attention. To which Mark inquires, "Hey, why aren't you paying attention."

Still nothing.

"I was just curious. Wanted to know more about you. I have a stomach ache."

Mark is dumbfounded. People are just ignoring him.

They're hoping he shuts up, but they're thoughts aren't put into words.

It's not weird. Most life forms don't even use words. Take ants. They don't have vocal cords and are nearly blind. Ants communicate using chemicals called pheromones.

Whenever you see an lots of ants, all their communication happens with these pheromones. They have no choice but to respond to commands from the colony.

I'm not wasting your time here. I mention this for a reason. Because anytime words won't do, we humans respond by sending out signals just like ants do. Smiles, screams, hugs and the look of shame.

And that is what this teenage girl does with Mark. She crushes him, shames him with virtual pheromones to shut the fuck up, sit there, stop talking about magic because people here are so sick. Everyone's hear to a doctor.

Mark doesn't just stop talking. He gets the message the girl wants to force on him. He should shut up.

- Note, and this is important, Mark finds dull people. No one wants to socialize. These characters aren't like in the sitcoms. They're guarded and anxious, or just fucking boring, people with no story to tell but Netflix (mean GO train girl).  Mark wants to engage and exchange (perhaps about his illness?), but finds nothing but dead air.

- note, most people are dressed well. they're prepared, ie not experiencing an emergency.

- It's then that Mark invents (relives his own story as it turns out) his real story, with his real mother. Which starts below....

Just then a new person walks into the ER. A young mother clutching a toddler. The mother is dressed in random clothes. She almost jumps to the triage nurse and grabs the admissions seat.

The nurse and mother talk. The nurse picks up her phone and starts talking while directing the scared mother to take a seat in the waiting room.

This case looks more serious than the others.

A row of chairs has opened up near the back. The mother walks to the open seats. She sits down and holds a kid covered with blankets.

You might not think it because it's not the scene of the gentle snowfall outside, but this is a very memorable image to another who cares to look. A mother caring for her sick kid.

Nobody cares to look. Except Mark.

He takes the scene in. Looking about thirty, with baggy eyes and ruffled clothes this mother is a sight to behold among the better dressed patients. At a corporate job she'd probably be sent home for breaking the rules. But now she doesn't care, because she holds her child. The little kid is so wrapped in her mother's arms, bundled up so much and held so tight we can't even see the tike.

Mark take out a notepad. A quality notepad at that. Shinola brand, hand made in Detroit. He sketches the image with decent skill. It being Christmas, he can't help but make the image look like Mary holding a sick Jesus.

Mark sketches. He's thinking to himself, "Even toddler Jesus must have had broken arm or stomach flu when he was growing up. I want to help. I'll turn her hat into a veil, blankets into loin clothes, and teary eyes into, well Mary cried, mothers always cry over their kids. I should leave her tears unchanged."
When he finishes the sketch, he uses his pocket knife to carefully cut it from his his notebook. He gets up, and walks over to the mother and sick kid.

"I drew this for you."

The mother looks up. Before even looking at the sketch she says "Oh my God. Thank you." Then the mother takes in the sketch. It's her and her kid as a work of art.

She's getting a pheromones now; that somebody cares.

"This is a wonderful piece of art. You have talent. Thank you so much." She hands it back to Mark.

"No, keep it. It's a gift." The mother's mouth, so strained with worry and sleeplessness, moves into broad smile.

Now her toddler looks at it. Together the parent and child have a moment; art giving them some pain relief.

The moment passes and Mark asks, "What's the matter? I have a stomach ache. Or I drank too much eggnog. I got drunk. But don't tell my mom." Mark says the last part with a cheeky grin.

"We don't know what's wrong. She's feverish, with a pain in her left arm."

"Do you know what the best medicine is?..." Mark smacks his hands together.

"Candy!" Mark says to the toddler. "Candy is always the best medicine, right?"

There's a candy cane in the young toddler's hands.

"Right!" says the kid.

The mother, toddler, and a stranger, laugh in an ER.

"Mary" a nurse yells out. The mother turns her head, no longer laughing. She takes her kid and goes with the nurse. Mark says behind.

"Good luck" says Mark as Mary and Jessica leave the fun kid behind.

"Can I have a candy cane?" asks a male patient

"What's wrong with you?" asks Mark.

"Sprained my ankle." says the patient.

The gorgeous candy cane is doing the trick for Mary's sick kid. She's smiling while going towards her fate. While looking at Mary and Jessica Mark says to the patient, "You don't need it."

---

Mary stands while Jessica sits on the examination table. That's something no mother wants to see. But Mary is putting on a brave face for her daughter.

Jessica is seven years old. Old enough to understand her situation but still young enough her mother thinks she's still an infant.

Jessica is holding her beautiful candy cane. The treat still has the plastic wrapping but that doesn't stop Jessica from pretty much tasting it with her eyes. All her attention is on this treat. Yours would be too.

Mary appreciates the gift more and more. Any distraction is worth gold right now. "Looks good doesn't it Jess." says the mother. The kid enthusiastically nods her head.

In walks the doctor.

- a loving examination follows
- this introduces the medical tests, lifestyle, that Mark lives through.

In the background, in the hallway, walks Mark. He looks inside the room. He sees Jessica sitting in the bed in a gown with an electrode wire attached to her arm.

Mark stops and stares at the image. In a world filled with boring events unfit for memories, the image of a mother with her sick kid is one that can embody both love and despair in a single frame. A black hole sun.

A memory to last a lifetime that anyone would hope has a happy ending.

Mark pulls out another candy cane. This one is a real beauty, flashes of red, green, bits of blue tinsel ripples through the eyes of anyone lucky enough to see the edible work of art. And the top it off is a crown of gold; one fit for a princess.

Mark leaves the treat on the window sill. No one notices, but Jessica does. The earlier gift lifted her spirits and now this one inspires a smile.

- more examination....

But that's it. Thank the heavens she's going to be okay.

The real drama is happening somewhere else.

---

- banter
- he asks about Mary and Jessica. Mainly about Jessica, his idyllic mother.
- he meets Tyler who jokes with him
- when to enter this scene? building up with some examination, or straight to the shock of his illness?

Mark has his ear against a porcelain cup. The cup is pressed against a wall. He's listening to the conversation next door.

In walks the nurse. "Hi there, Mark is it?"

"Yes."

"Well Mark, where are your parents?"

"She's paying the meter."

"Oh...okay... well let's get started. Why don't you tell me where the pain is."

"Is she going to be okay?"

"Who?"

"The girl next door. Black hair, big smile, her mother is as sweet as Taylor Swift."

"Taylor Swift?"

"It's a high bar and she happens to met it."

"Well good for her. They're running some tests, but I think she'll be okay. Can we talk about you maybe."

"You sound just like Taylor. You from Pennsylvania?"

"I am. You speak with our favorite daughter often?"

"All the time."

"That's great. Well say hi for me the next time you speak with her. Tell her we could use her at the next fundraiser."

"I'll bring her on a date. Right at the nice courtyard around the corner. The one with the cherry trees."

"Excellent spot very romantic. Now... let's go where does it hurt?"

"You know. It's not hurting so bad. Maybe, yeah I think I can go."

"Take it easy fella. When you're mom gets here she can decide if you want to leave. For now, let's just talk. And while your first date with Miss Taylor Swift is wonderful topic I want to hear about you. It says here you have a tummy ache. What does the tummy pain feel like?"

Isn't it interesting. Dreams are so hard to nail down; like paintings in the mist. But pain? You can test and find pain no problem. It's almost like our bodies are just pain detectors. And this nurse wants to find out about this kids sensors are saying.

She catches Mark looking at the clock. The time piece is analog so it's taking a second for the boy to figure out the minute hand.

"Mark, where are your parents?"

Marks says nothing. All the whimsey, character, and stories the kid had are gone. He doesn't even think to take out one of the candy canes he has in his pocket.

He's scared.

"Take off your jacket because I need to see if your sick."

Mark follows the command. Most people follow commands and he's just a kid after-all.

The worried boy takes off the jacket. There's a thick sweater. He doesn't even wait for the order to take it off. The next layer is another sweater, then a long sleeve t-shirt, a toque, and finally the white pair of sneakers that danced the snow off at the entrance not 25 minutes ago.

Soon Mark is standing there, in his jeans, socks and a under-shirt. The nurse is standing there too, and she's in awe.

A nightmarish awe.

She sees an image that starts this story, a story of a kid of 11 that was very much hidden under layers. Layers meant to protect from the cold of winter instead hid the pain of...

Something this long-time medical professional doesn't see very often.

A medical mystery.

"Mark...." mumbles the nurse.

He's frail, skinny, and malnourished. There are what looks like burns across his chest. Cigar sized. There's even a needle mark on his arm. This is beside the huge scar in his side. The nurse hopes it's from a surgery.

"Where is your mother?" asks the nurse with a tinge of anger in her voice.

"I never know how to answer that one. I'm just supposed to say it hurts, and get the prescription." replies Mark. "But my tummy does hurt this time."

Mark gets up on the bed and sits on it. The nurse goes over, and starts her examination. She places the stethoscope all over the chest, heart, and lungs.

- The mother wanted Mark to gain meds, but left. That's the House story for this chapter, that's only true in Mark's origin story he's reliving.
- This chapter/episode should mimic a House episode. Pain => Review => Possibilities => Tests => Diagnosis, which doesn't solve the pain. And on it goes twice or so until someone looks up/at the Sick Kids fundraising brochure.

This nurse, whose name is Betty by the way, has been around. And she's well passed the threshold she needs to know; this patient needs to be admitted and the ER doctors needs to be called. Likely a number of specialists too.

Mark is soon alone again in the room. The nurse left to get reinforcements. He again picks up the porcelain cup and listens into what's happending next door.

Mary is singing softly to Jessica.

"Rudolf the red nose reindeer, had such a shiny nose. And if you ever saw him, you could even say it glows...."

Mark closes his eyes and takes in the moment of a loving mother. Now we know a little bit why he was so drawn to the image of a loving parent.

Mark touches his pocket filled with his magnificent treats. This Christmas song is taking him away to some place. He's in so deep he doesn't notice a doctor open and close the door.

Dr. Cameron watches Mark. She's got no idea what's he's doing listening to next door, holding an expensive candy cane. But being a proper scientist she doesn't interrupt. She observes.

Soon the nurse returns. After quietly closing the door, she tells the doctor what's going on next door, "the mom's only singing Rudolf to her kid".

"Thank you." says Dr. Cameron. It takes a little while, but Mark eventually lets off the cup, hangs the candy cane on his undershirt, and looks at the doctor.

"Hi Mark. I'm Doctor Cameron. It's nice to meet you."

"Nice to meet you too" replies Mark.

"Thank you. Now I'm here to do something called an examination. We have people outside looking for your mother..." This gives Mark a fright, another observation to note down. "But we're going to go ahead now ok? The rules give me the responsibility to make sure you're healthy and safe."

Mark nods. The examination starts. The doctor and nurse do what they do. Touch here, prod that. Press down.

Mark doesn't get involved. He's the ideal patient and simply does what he's asked. And what he's asked is to answer a simple question lots of times, "Does this hurt?"

Mark responds each time. Pain is the sign of truth.

Once the five minute examination is done. Mark is left in the room alone again.

Outside the nurse and doctor compare notes. They exchange a host of medical problems. We've heard many of the words before on television dramas. Diseases from lupus to typhoid.

The medical terminology flies back and forth. It's meaningless to regular people. What's concerning to us is medical professionals don't stop talking for a long time.

"Every week has one true medical problem" says the nurse.

"This is once a year." replies the doctor

As they look around, Mark is picking up the cup again, taking it to the wall, and listening to another Christmas carol.

Dr. Cameron says with emotion, "Go find his mother."

---

- ends with Mark being diagnosed with some serious stuff, while Jennifer walks out with a cold. Mixing extremes, and the theme, of happy and sad. Remember it ends with a poster image of the mother/life Mark never had.
  
---

"The mother isn't here either."

"He says he isn't on any medications"

"That's impossible." Dr. Cameron is standing in front of a security guard Tony, nurse Betty, and hospital assistant Tyler.

"Tyler, go get 10cc of zombie1". Tyler nods his head and jogs off down the hall.

"Without the mother?". Burse Betty asks the doctor a fair question. Examining a mysterious kid is one thing, but administering powerful drugs without consent or even a patient history is another.

"It's better to be ready." It's not everyday Dr. Cameron deals with these questions. The ER is mostly filled with colds and sprains from people too impatient to wait to see their family doctor in the morning because "Dr. Google" shows picture of ebola to anyone who asks.

Thankfully, Dr. Blue arrives. He's not a super-hero of course, just another doctor for Cameron to collaborate with; and she's already thinking to herself, to get sued with.

Hindsight is 20/20 as the saying goes. And now these two doctors must decide what action will the lawyers determine years from now they should have been made on the spot with incomplete information.

Cameron wipes that future lawsuit from her mind. There's a sick kid in her examination room.

"He says he's waiting for his mother to answer questions. But she's gone." Dr. Cameron continues with true apprehension, "He's very cooperative though, let's give him an x-ray to rule out any breaks. MRI to see what's inside".

Dr. Blue responds. "I can see the rationale, but you're the attending."

"Thanks". Dr. Blue is also thinking of the lawyers.

Dr. Blue goes on, "Test till there's nothing let to test. It's late so most of the patients left already. All the tests are non-evasive, so worst cast we blow a ton of insurance money."

Dr. Cameron and Dr. Blue go back to exchanging medical conditions usually reserved for shows that dramatize the usually boring life of an Emergency Room.

As the doctors are talking, out comes Mark. He's listening to each word. He's smirking wider with every syllable. He walks a short distance and grabs a huge candy cane.

Well, this ones actually a walking cane covered in festive wrapping paper.

The nurses and doctors see him as he walks towards them. Cane in right hand, Mark walks limping on his cane. The patient Mark is smiling, and the doctors and nurses can't help but smile back.

At least this medical mystery is in better spirits. They must be doing something right.

"Well I just had to hear what you wonderful doctors think. Please go on."

The group looks at each other and continue talking. Mark pays attention as if he's the supervisor. Anyone looking from afar might mistake Mark for the one coordinating this impromptu medical conference.

It's really quite the cute image.

As the doctors finish they agree. X-Ray then MRI and they'll let the tests decide the next steps.

Dr. Cameron turns to Mark, kneeling down to speak with him on even terms, "Mark, we're going to run some tests. An x-ray to see your bones, and a MRI to see your tissues. They won't hurt at all. Unless you'd like to tell me some more about yourself?"

Mark is leaning on his cane. He's thinking about his situation. Everyone waits for his answer as he passes his cane back and forth between his hands.

"I doubt I could do any better than the excellent medical care in your hands."

Accepting that evasive answer, Dr. Cameron tells medical assistant Tyler to take Mark to get the tests done. She watches them as they walk down the hall. Mark doesn't even look awkward using the cane. Perhaps that's a clue she thinks to herself.

Behind the good doctor enter Jessica and Mary. The mother and daughter wait to speak with their doctor. Dr. Cameron turns around, "Thank you so much for the help. I was just so worried."

"You're welcome. Pinch her left hand, and if there's any pain bring her back. But everything should be fine."

Jessica is holding her beautiful candy cane.

"I think you can enjoy that now." says Dr. Cameron.

As Mark turns the corner with cane in hand, Jessica peels away the wrapper from the candy cane.

Both kids are smiling because Mark is ear to ear while walking down the hallway into the hospital as Jessica is enjoying her treat while walking out.

Mary and Jessica walk past the ER, the triage nurses, the black welcome mat with "Hopedale Hospital" in big pink letters, and into the spinning doors.

On the outside, Mary and Jessica, minutes before a very concerned mother and scared daughter, take a second to look around.

They see the picturesque city in all its glory. Snowfall over paradise. The restaurants, the decorations, and the people come alive. The two smile to each other and embrace in a soulful hug.

And the artist we met before takes notice. She finishes her huge city wide illustration with one last addition. Next to Mark entering the hospital spinning doors, she adds mother and daughter embracing outside.

Yet another happy story to include in the Christmas city-scape.

The artist finishes the sketch, signs it "B. Cormier". She closes her iPad, tucks it away into her back pack, and looks around for another image to inspire her.

## Cane

Going back to Mark. He's walking with the hospital orderly Tyler who is 24 years old. Athletic and tall, dressed in hospital slacks.

The two exchange chit-chat about Christmas presents and sports. Tyler insists the new X-Box console is better than the Steam Deck. Mark responds with "you're an idiot" but the harsh words are said with a bluster every gamer is used to when talking about their favorite gear. Tyler responds with "you're an loser".

The blustering insults go back and forth and each time both giggle.

The conversations stop as technicians take over. First the x-ray is done, then the MRI. Mark follows all directions without complaint as he continues being the perfect patient. The test results are put into a folder and handed over to Tyler.

But Mark reaches for it faster.

Folder in left hand, cane in right, Mark starts walking back to the Dr. Cameron and Dr. Blue. Tyler goes with the young patient of course but there's none of the friendly talk they had when getting here.

As Mark makes his way back to the ER, the doctors are busy seeing other patients. The complaints almost always not serious so the doctors are not engaged. Sprains mixed with colds of "Dr. Google" variety.

Mark walks past both doctors and goes into a large conference room. The walls are glass so it's easy to see he's waiting for them.

He stays there with his cane in hand.

Dr. Blue enters first, because Dr. Cameron is admonishing Tyler for letting Mark take the test results. After Tyler runs off on another errand, Dr. Cameron enters and sits at the table.

Mark, with two doctors in front of him, stands with his cane, and starts asking questions.

"Every investigation starts off with some assumptions. So what are yours?" Mark grabs a marker to write on the whiteboard.

Too curious to object, and to obligated to get some answers, Dr. Blue decides to play along.

Dr. Blue starts if off "Fancy word #1".

Dr. Cameron objects with a "Donald". Dr. Blue responds with a shrug and a smile. Mark in enjoying himself, "We'll find out what we need to know, what difference does it make how."

Bowing to pressure Dr. Cameron joins in. "Fancy world #2"

Mark writes both words down, "Okay, but let's pretend it's not the obvious answers".

"Fancy world #3, Fancy world #4" from Dr. Cameron.

"Fancy world #5" from Dr. Blue.

Mark continues writing. Caught up in the moment, the two doctors start debating. Their talk is all gibberish to anyone but a doctor s so why bother writing it here.

Regular people can understand is how animated the doctors become in their back and forth. The doctors big brains are relishing this debate. At least it's not a sprain or cold.

The medical mini conference goes on to Mark delight.

Dr. Blue and Dr. Cameron say more fancy words and Mark writes them down with furiously glee of a mentor happy his students are finally showing their skills.

Dr. Blue keeps going but Dr. Cameron stops when she realizes something. Her head slants involuntarily, like we all do when we realize something for the first time.

Mark's been spelling the Fancy medical worlds properly.

Dr. Cameron then looks at Mark's eyes, and he only smiles back at her with a grin.

Dr. Cameron is a pretty women. She's smart as a whip too. But all we can see is her eyes in the daze, the clues are everywhere, and her unconscious is trying to put it all together.

His clothes were far too big. His mother was all clothes up and left him here. He's very sick. But he's happy.

She can't make the connections.

Mark gives her nothing. He won't tell her. This frail child is refusing all attempts at help.

Dr. Cameron "what's wrong with you!".

Dr. Blue snaps out of his relaxed manner, "Kid we need to know now."

Mark, leaning on his cane, responds with walking back and forth in front of the white board, and goes to the top of the list.

"You said Fancy word #1" but that requires "Fancy word A", not there.

"You said Fancy word #2" but that requires "Fancy word B", not there.

"You said Fancy word #3" but that requires "Fancy word C", not there.

"But you said Fancy word #4" but that, that is interesting.

Dr. Blue asks the obvious question "Are you some kind of genius?" Mark loves the question and throws over the test results. Dr. Blue rips it open to find out the answer.

But Dr. Cameron is done with this scene. She's now playing psychologist. Out of her expertise, she's forced to play along for now.

After seeing the results, and looking at them again. Dr. Blue's face is grave. "Kid, we need to know where you come from, who's your doctor?"

"The answer is right there in those results. Faster then any phone call."

Dr. Blue combs over the results more.

Dr. Cameron however realizing something important. She can't play psychologist, but juvenile psychologist.

As Dr. Blue says the words "Kid, you could be in serious trouble..."

"I could be dying. That doesn't mean you get the answer."

- add "Is this normal?" scene?, where House shows his pain. Would Mark's meds be wearing off? yeah, and his pain would be showing through, but he overcomes to live his dreams.

As Mark keeps playing director for these two doctors we return to the Cormier, the artist sketching life on her iPad. Because the canvas is infinite, she's kept going and adding more and more detail. Now she's found the jewel to her opus. She finally looked up and saw a billboard that hangs overtop the bustling city like an angel on the Christmas tree.

In 1947, Dr. Sydney Farber needed to raise money for his research. He was obesssed with curing childhood cancer. He knew people needed a story to understand the traumatic memories of his patients. So he told the story of "Jimmy", a sick kid in his hospital.

Soon The Jimmy Fund was funding research and hospitals that saved countless kids pain and suffering. Jimmy went on to live a happy life. But cancer never stopped its assault on humanity, and so the memories of pain needed a new story to tell.

It's an advertisement for the "Sick Kids Hopedale fundraiser Campaign". On it is Mark. Bald head, skinny, and sick.

The only thing missing is the grin on Mark while the doctors are going back and forth in front of his whiteboard until...

Dr. Cameron blurts outs "You're a patient".

Mark beams a smile, "End scene".

===

Christmas trees and presents, Rudolf and snowmen, tinsel and candy canes. They're everywhere on the walls and doors. People are also everywhere. It's a Christmas party. The decorations bring the North Pole to this hospital. They're so good they almost make one forget this is the child's ward.

It's the annual Christmas party. The patients run around with presents and glee every kid should experience this time of year.

There's a box of candy canes, the beautiful artistic ones Mark was enjoying inside the ER.

The elevator doors open, and Mark gets out. He walks with his candy cane, and walks past the festivities. A nurse says to him "Hi Mark, where did you go?"

"Something tells me you'll hear all about it." Mark says in a gruffed voice as he keeps walking.

The hallway is long because it takes up the entire top floor. On each side there is a patient room. Filled with technological marvels that either help find pain or ease it. As Mark walks down the hallway, each room gets larger, and the medical marvels get larger too.

He makes it to the end of the hall and the last room. It's dark, so we don't see much beyond to notice how big it is.

He goes inside, sits on his bed. He's had quite the night and takes a deep breadth to settle down.

Mark then takes out a binder, and flips through the pages. We can't see the pages, until he stops on a "Home Alone". The iconic Christmas movie about a kid being left home alone while his family goes on a vacation. We see the page and we see the iconic image of Catherine O'Hare hugging the little kid with all the hallmarks of a motherly embrace.

Mark then takes out the sketch he did of Mary and Jessica. He looks down the hallway at all the parents with their kids. None are coming for Mark.

He keeps filling the pages of his book. He stops on a new page.

Down the hall, the elevator doors open, Admin enters storming with anger. Dr. Cameron is behind her. The Admin storms in and stands out among the Christmas celebrations.

Charge Nurse enters and asks "Can I help you?".

"Where is Mark..."

"Not now."

"He has to."

"We don't care."

"$50,000 in bills tonight because he..."

The charge nurse and hospital administrator get into it.

Dr. Cameron injects, "Someone needs to request these tests..."

"I don't think so." that idea is shut down.

Admin asks a fair question "How did he get the required paperwork to even get admitted into the ER?"

"That's not our department. He's not a prisoner and no one talks to him unless we're there."

The fight is over money. The bills racked up tonight are coming from somewhere, and no one wants to hold the bill when the check arrives.

The party slows down, as their voices raise. Nurses, support staff, parents, and patients, all walk down the hallway, and slowly get to Mark's room.

They see him on his bed, on the wall, is the image of Home Alone and the mother hugging her son. And the other image. This one of a image of a man's face. Long and determined are his bright blue eyes. Razor stubble of his greying hair. And a cane in resting across on his eye.

The words "HOUSE" in bold letters at the top, an advertisement for the television show staring Hugh Laurie as Dr. House, who can diagnosis any illness, but has a rough exterior. The modern story of Sherlock Holmes.

Mark lies in his bed. Voices abound outside. No one can enter, because he has no medical emergency to grant them access to his house. He puts on his wireless headphones and puts up the volume to his dream girl, Taylor Swift.

### chapter notes

- after chapter one ordeal, Mark returns to his room/cell. He knows everyone and knows where everything is. He then opens his notebook crosses out/rips out *House* from his Iconic Memories book/wall.
- he then goes to sleep, wearing headphones and listening to something we don't yet know. A better world he fights to live for.

## 24 Reasons Why

The ringing of a alarm clock. The annoying noise isn't coming from a smartphone as most people do these days. Instead it's from an old fashioned alarm clock. A large clock that can be easily programmed to go off whenever you'd like.

This clock went off at 5:50 AM. And it gets smashed, right on the snooze button.

In the bed turns Tyler. And we realize he uses an alarm clock. So much easier to smash it and buy yourself a few more minutes of happiness inside the cocoon of bed sheets and duvet.

Tyler is actually fools himself with this trick and buys himself some happiness, losing himself in the time of.... and then the damned alarm clock goes off again.

"Stop it and just go!" says the women who was sleeping beside him.

She tosses herself and goes back to sleep.

Tyler kisses the woman on her head and then finally gets up. He does his morning routine. Bathroom, shave, shower, coffee, eggos, traffic, audio book, traffic, drive through, traffic.

He finally pulls into the city and parks his car on the fourth level of the garage. He walks to the elevator and to his office.

The office is full of cubicles. Tyler enters one of them. Some pictures are on the desk, a HP computer. And too many binders.

In the cubicle across from him we hear "Oh no, you didn't like the amount, that's unexpected, I sent our best guys".

## Life of Pain

---

### Chapter Notes L of P

- prequel.
- we see marks origin story. his mother is an addict, and did use him for opiods. She eventually, left him at the ER. If she's found out, she looses her job, and Mark's insurance. She can't help herself but still loves him so she's stays away.
- Mark is pre-Mark. We see him as a regular kid, playing his part. He's like a convict with a life sentence, spending his time see others leave, not even a mother nearby. He's the poster boy.
- Bored and alone and hopeless, he isolates himself.
- Then Batman comes in. A blessed man who visits kids in super-hero costumes. He plays with Mark. But much more importantly, he teaches Mark (like Rousseau would like) to go back further, and see himself as a freeman in Nature. He asks Mark repeatedly, "who are you". Mark responds with "Batman". But that's not good enough. "Who are you" over and over. Mark lets Life in, and realizes he can be, do, whatever (a lesson he teaches Tyler). "Who are you" Mark smirks and says "Joker".
- And hence he starts causing trouble with his new found freedom.

## Stargazing Neo

## Maximus Decimus Meridius

- Tyler's failed marriage.
- Maximus, Maximus.
- Instead of the props. He finds his true love.
- Another brick to happiness.

## Mark F*cking Magic

- goes for his dreams. goes on stage.
- does well.

## Entropy's Is The Reasons Why

- Mark sleeps with the headphones. He's on medication/drugs, he hears a person coming into his room, talking in despair. This person is trying to hold it together, and finds it helpful to see how Mark fights on despite his condition.
- The person talks of suicide.
- Tyler finds out and demands to know more.
- Mark can't tell him, Mark says at least. To hazy when he sleeps.
- Tyler goes on mission to find the person.
- He looks through multiple people. First the patients, then the staff, then whoever.
- No luck. He can't see through the facade hiding someone's depression. But who to help?
- Mark snaps, "if you don't know who, you never well, what does that mean?"
- Tyler proceeds to be nice to everyone. Genuinely interested and a none asshole. Happy.
- Tyler transformation is complete. He's Emile/Rousseau's new man.
- The visits stop. A life is saved. We never find out who wrote the letter.

The note.

"By now you might be thinking if there's anything you could have done. The short answer is no. The long answer is I didn't want you too.

I didn't want you too because I didn't want to give up. So I decided to take my life. It was the only way to keep my dreams.

You want me to justify myself. Fine I will.

If you want to understand this, you must know what it is to dream. Actually dream of something you want to do. Write a book, earn a medal, start a band, sail around the world.

If I lived it would been dreamless. Like a sail, our souls needs dreams to keep moving.

I'm tired of the shit. The complete bullshit. I spend all day with people I lie to. How fucked up is that. Then I spend the rest of my day buying shit I didn't make. Or worse, coming over to see someone's new shit I don't care about.

You know anyone who killed themselves over a counter-top? It's because no one was inspired to dream about one either.

It was the pain. The pain of a million shocks, from a million wounds. The pain of burdens, of wounds, of having to smile them off. The pain of no longer being able to justify this is our species?

99.9999 of all species life's populated this little globe with have gone from it. There was something better suited to keeping life alive against the pain of fighting entropy.

Life has this tiny little beach head on a marble twirling in a vacuum, being bombarded by radiation; a fingertip on a ledge. And still our worst enemies aren't that!

It's caring so much that killed me. I can't stop fighting for the good side. I can't defeat the dark side. The pain of hunger, war, despair is the only cure to humanity's problems. My death will help more than my life.

It's the irony that killed me. People can be so amazing. From the scientists working all day to make some pill that cures a sickness, to the janitor cleaning up the lab so it's ready to go on the next session. The two can spark a friendship that forges devotion and loyalty across all the weapons of entropy.

Brought together with life's beautiful tools of friendship persons have conquered so much. Yet at every level, from every angle, there's the greed, lust. We'd be better off never knowing each other. So easy do we make it for ourselves by taking from others.

I didn't want to keep alive on the fuel of hate.

- want to know what it's like. give up. whatever you're doing. stop it....

## Being Judged By Taylor Swift

Iconic songs night at AGT...

Marky V was for Victory. He won, and the Halloween parade is his victory parade, sailor and nurse his celebration/involvement.

- Tyler is loose and free. A notable local stand-up. Living a happy life. He's told America's Got Talent is coming to town on Halloween. Mark is going to perform. Instead of visiting, Mark tells Tyler to prepare things for him. Camera's, limos, party, whatever else, he wants to splurge. His room changed, and he wants to go outside and play.
- Tyler is over himself with joy. He's on stage spreading the word that Mark is going to change things. He's so jazzed up. He buys this and that, calls in favours to get tickets, bottle service even at some bars. He's going to make this a night to remember for his best friend.
- Then he finds out, through a friend (ex. Limo company) Taylor Swift is in town and is the (supposed) celebrity judge. This sends Tyler into overdrive. Even gets him believing in God.
- He's waiting in the basement of the performance center. While the show bustles above, he's waiting her to take pictures and prepare Mark for his stage performance.
- Then in walks Taylor Swift.
- Tyler freezes. He suspects but...
- Are you from "Make A Wish" she asks... (reversal)
- A contestant plays "American Pie" (an iconic song)
  A long long time ago
  I can still remember how
  That music used to make me smile
  And I knew if I had my chance
  That I could make those people dance
  And maybe they'd be happy for a while

- Mark prepared everything, the limo, the bottle service, the costumes, the everything, as the ultimate wingman. His last story will be going on a date with Taylor Swift.
- If Tyler can make it happen.
- Tyler has to act fast, and can't cry or mourn. Even the reader isn't given the time to think.
- "Let's go trick or treating". "I can't do that" she replies. "Something tells me we'll find some cool costumes here."
- As American Pie plays, the two go on a date, made free and fun because both are dressed in costumes. Tyler talks about all the stories he/Mark lived, and Taylor is fascinated at them all.
- They end up in the courtyard with the cherry trees. He a sailor, she a nurse. A party is walking all around them.
- In the room we see one more iconic memory. The World War II kiss "V-J Day in Times Square".
- "I met a girl who sang the blues" Mark's Victory Parade, as the Halloween parade surrounds Tyler and Taylor. Mark won, he lived his life, and this is his parade.
- As the song plays, "They were singing, bye, bye Miss American Pie".
- Tyler lands the kiss.
- Mark puts up the iconic poster. He looks at the amazing wall of memories he got to live.
- Mark removes his "thrall" zombie costume. He was one of the Swifts body guards, and got to spend the night with her, dance, drink, joke, etc.
- Do the guards, huge hearts, make space for Tyler/Taylor, facing outward. While one.Mark/Emil faces inward.
- As the song ends, "Singin' this can be the day that I die".
- Taylor writes a song about The Story of Magic Mark?
